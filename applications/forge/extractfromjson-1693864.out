"ABSTRACT\n. The relationship between law and moral is the one of the important problems of the philosophy of law. The complexity of the problems needs a comprehensive view that correlated with the concepts of man, society, politics, and ethics. The study of Chinese Philosophy in the Early Han time, with the Chinese philosophy character which tended to correlate with the philosophy of man and political ethics, is expected to give a contribution to the systematic studies of legal philosophy and comparative philosophy.\nThis philosophical research is a library research, which is done in three steps: I: collecting and classifying dataII: data analysisand III: evaluation and final report.\nThe research found that, on the basis of \"basic human goods\" for the sake of \"integral human fulfillment\", the relationship of law and moral are co-existence and interdependence. Both law and moral are qualification each other. The study of the Early Han philosophy justifies that statement. Generally, Early Han philosophy has a naturalistic view in the Yin-Yang cosmological terminology toward law and moral. Except on the Huang-Lao school, the formal philosophy tends to give a lesser status toward law (fa), and take morality (1i) as the ultimate social norms. Nevertheless, the Huai-nan Tau and Huang-Lao school which Taoistic in characters, refuse the cultivation of moral norms (1i), while Tung Chung-shu and Yang Hsiung support the social engineering by means of confucianization of law. The another important phenomenon in the Early Han period is the naturalization of law.\nKey words: law â moral â Early Han philosophy â fa â\n\n\n\n \n.\n\t, "

"Optimal sub-wavelength structures (SWS) with parabolic hole on glass substrate are designed using effective medium theory (EMT), which will reduce the reflectance over wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm and 0 degrees to 80 degrees angle of incidence. The performance of SWS integrated glass is verified by genetic algorithm. The optimized SWS with the cross-sectional profile of parabolic hole have parameters with similar to 120 nm diameter and 300 nm height. The average reflectance over wavelength range from 300 to 1200 mm and 0 degrees to 80 degrees angle of incidence could be reduced to only 0.5% by applying the optimized SWS onto glass.

Wilcox \nand Jason J. Moses \nExperiments have been conducted to determine the conditions \nthat cause surging in co~;tr)ressors and to determine the effect of \nvarious installations and opera%ing conditions on the character of \nthe velocity and pressure variations occurring dur1ing surging. These \ninvestigations were m d e  on three compressor units and the variation \nof static, total, or velocity pressure with time was recorded. In \naddition to the e~2erimental studies, a siaplified analysis was made \nto determine how instability of flow may occur in a compressor. An \nexamination, based on this analysis, %ras made of several possible . \nmethods of inhibiting the occurrence af surging. \nSurging was found to be a periodic variation of pressures and \nvelocities that may occur when the slope of the compressor characer- \nistic cnrve is positive. A tra~sition region of finite extent and \ncharacterized by erratic pulsations of small ~agnitude separated \nsurging from stable operation. The freqxency of the pulsations \nwas always the sama thrcughout the unit,; the wave form was frequently \nnonsinusoidal. \nThe actual magnitude of the slope at which surging begins is \ndetermined by the iime required for the static gressure in the \nexternal pipes to adJust itself to a change in flow conditions in \nthe conpressor passages. The ma~nitudc ar;d the frequency of the \npressure 2ulsations, as well as the point on thc characteristic \ncurve at which surging begins, depend on a comylex relation of the \ncapacity and the resistance of each component of the total system. \nBecause the occurrence and manifestaticn of unsta5le oparation is \ndependent on the d,vnamic ?roperties of the ccnplete air-flow system, \nattem~ts to utilizc one ~f the several methods for inliibitlng surge \nshould be rnade only on ths actual installation with which thc\"com- \npressor is to bs used. \nNACA TN Eo. 1213 \nINTRODUCTION \nI n  modern high-s~eed superchargers and' compressors a periodic \npulsating flow known a s  surging terminates the operating range a t  \nlow flow ra tes .  I n  order t o  obtain the desired f l e x i b i l i t y  of \noperation of an a i r c r a f t  power plant,  the range of the compressorj \nindicated by the r a t i o  of maximum volume flow t o  minimum volume flow, \nmust be a s  large as  possible. The range of centrifugal compressors \nrapidly decreases as  the impeller t i p  speed is inc rea~ed .  The \ndemand fo r  increased power-plant performance a t  high a l t i tudes ,  \nhowever, has placed increasing emphasis on the necessity f o r  high \nt3.p speeds. A s  a r e su l t ,  when a compressor is designed f o r  m a x i -  \nmum power, the cruising power may be l imited by the occurrence of \nsurging. An extension of the surge-free range of operation of \ncentrifugal compressors i s  therefore an important par t  of compressor \nresearch. \nReferences 1, 2 ,  and 3 have s tated tha t  surging i s  essent ial ly  \nthe r e su l t  of a flow ins tab i l i ty ,  which occurs only when the slope \nof the character is t ic  curve (pressure r a t i o  against flow function) \nis posit ive.  The slope of the character is t ic  curve where surging \nbegins, however, is not the same f o r  alL corn-pressors; i n  fac t ,  when \na given compressor uni t  i s  tested i n  two ins ta l la t ions ,  the value \nof the flow function a t  whizch swging begins ( the surge point) is \nfrequently different .  Although the slope of the character is t ic  \ncurve influences the occurrence of surging, several unknown prop- \ne r t i e s  of the complete in s t a l l a t ion  apparently a l so  govern i t s  \noccurrence. \nI n  the t e s t s  reportea i n  reference 3, an attempt was made t o  \ninfluence the posit ion of the surge point by introducing a fluc- \ntuat ing flow a t  che compressor in l e t .  This forced periodicity of \nflow w a s  found t o  have a negligible e f fec t .  \nObservations of the character is t ics  of the pressure pulsations \nduring surging (references 2 and 3) indicated tha t  the frequency \nand magnitude of the pulsations a re  somewhat affected by the volume \nof the compressor and the pipes of the system. I n  general, an \nincrease i n  t h i s  vol~une apparently resulted i n  an increase i n  the \namplitude of the pulsatians and a reduction i n  the frequency. \nI n  the present investigation, a special  recording instrument \nwap used t o  obtain an estimate of the magnitude and frequency of \nthe pressure p~xlsaticns during surging. Experimental studies wers \nmade of the t rans i t ion  f ~ o m  steady flow t o  surging and of the phase \nre la t ion  of s t a t i c ,  t o t a l ,  and velocity pressures during swging. \n1L \nOther experiments were made t o  detemine how the frequency and the \nmagnitu4e of the pulsations were affected by changes i n  the volme \n.of the compressor system and the t i p  speed of the impeller, \nSeveral of the records of the pressure pulsations a re  presented \nand discussed. A simplified analysis is presented t o  show how insta-  \nb i l i t y  of flow may be produced i n  a compressor and an examination \nbased on t h i s  ana.lysis is  made of several possible methods of \ninhibi t ing the occurrence of surging. \nPart  of the experimental work was done on two t e s t  uni ts  a t  the \nNACA Langley Field' laboratory, More complete t e s t s  a 3 h e  Cleveland \nlaboratory were made on a th i rd  t e s t  which was especially \ndesigned fo r  surge studies. \nCompressor Test Rigs \nThree separate t e s t  uni ts  were used fo r  the experimental inves- \nt igat ions.  Each unit  was s e t  up t o  conform t o  the standards and \nspecifications recommended i n  reference 4. I n  each instance, the \ncompressor uni t  was mounted d i rec t ly  on a speed increaser having a \nstep-up r a t i o  of 15:l  and was driven by an a i r c ra f t  engine or a \ndynamome-her. The a i r  flow w a s  determined by measuring the pressure \ndrop across a calibrated o r i f i ce  with an TJACA micromanometer. P i to t  \ntubes of 0.060-inch s t e e l  tubing were instal led a t  the  i n l e t  and the \nout le t  measuring stations; s t a t i c  or i f ices  of C,050-inch diameter \nwere placed a short distance upstream of the p i to t  tubes. Throttles \nwere placed i n  the i n l e t  and oc t le t  pipes t o  regulate the flow, \nTests were f i r s t '  made on uni t  A, which consisted of a f u l l y  \nshrouded im2eller and a. vaned diffuser  mounted i n  a standard NACA \nvariable-component t e s t  r i g  having a torus-shaped collector of \n15-cubic-fo~t  c a p c i t y ,  (see reference 4. ) \nUnit B consisted of a mixed-flow impeller and a 20-inch-diameter \nvaneless diffuser ,  which were a l so  mounted i n  a variable-component \nt e s t  r ig .  \nThe greatest  par t  of the work was done on t e s t  unit  C ( f i g ,  l ) ,  \nwhich was especially designed fo r  investigations of the cause and \ncharacter of the surge pulsations. Because the volume enclosed i n  \nthe collector may have had an ef fec t  on the r e su l t s  of previous \ninvestigations, t h i s  unit was designed t o  make.the t o t a l  volume of \nthe compressor i t s e l f  as  small as  possible. A conventional impeller, \nwhich was modified by reducing both the diameter at the inlst and \nthe height cf the blades at the tips, was used in this rig. The \nvaneless diffuser, which formed an integral unit with the scroll \ncoll.ector, was designed to avoid the occurrence of separation in \nthe diffus~r. Eie disturbances in the flow system at low volume \nflows were reduced by designiq the lip at the discharge of tlie \ncollector to have a 0' angle of attack at a low volume flow. A \nschematic diagram of the rig in ~~hich t is unit was tested is shown \nin figure 2. \nInstantmeocs Pressure Recorder \nThe pressure an6 velocity pv.lsations during surging were \nmeasured. on a stan3mrd X-AC-4 dlff erentiaL-pressuTe recorder. This \ninstrument has been described in references 5 and 6 but, for \"ue \nconvenience of the reader, SOMO of its principles are described \nagain. The instrument with two cells installed is sho~~n i fig- \nure 3. \nTwo simultaneous -pressure recordings can be taken by using \n~TTO cells with a single film unit. Because the pressure cell actu- \nally measures differential pressures, the variations in static \npressure, total pressure, or velocity ~reasure may be recorded. \nStatic and total rressures are o~posed'by some lz~own pressure, usval-ly \natmospheric, to oStain a drrsct trace of pressuse variation with \ntime: The variatzon in velocity pressure is recorded by introducing \nstatic pressure on one side of the diaphragm and total pressure on \nthe other; the instrument records the differential pressure and a \nt~ace of the velocity-pressure variation is thereby obta.ined. .ALsc, \nby recordinr; a differential pressure rather than an absolute pres- \nswe, a sensitive cell can be us=d for a large range of compressor \noperating condi tZons. I , \nWhen uscd with-test units A and B, thtt 'instrument com~rised \ntwo cells: one with a differential-pressure range from 0 to \n5r) inches of water, the other with a range from 0 to 30 inches of \nwater. Cells with progsure ranaes from 0 to 5 inches of water and \n0 to 50 inches of water worc used for tests on uniB C. When the \nsensitive cell was uscd, the vibrations of the motor and the gear \ntrain that movod tha film past the light orifice were recorded along \nwith the pressure var:ations, Although these vibrations combined \nwith the pressure vihations to superimpose a low-frequency osciT- \nlation on the film record, tho accuracy ~f tbe frequency measure~on5s \nwas not affected. \nA study of t he  cha r ac t e r i s t i c s  of t h e  pressure-recoyding system \nshowed t h a t  t he  indicated mgni tudes  of t he  Dressure va r ia t ions  were \nnot, al.togo?ther r e l i ab l e ,  being a f fec ted  b; the  s i z e ,  t h e  type, and \nt h e  length of t h e  pressure tubeti, I n  general,  however, t h e  nagni- \ntudes of t he  pressure va r ia t ions  indicated by the  t r a ce s  were \nroughly proport ional  t o  thoso ac tua l l y  occurring i~ the  system \nwhen t he  i n s t a l l a t i o n  remained unchar~ged f o r  t h e  e n t i r e  s e r i e s  of \nt e s t s .  The recording system was probably accurate  enough t o  r e g i s t e r  \nt r a c e s  s l-milar t o  the ac tua l  pressure waves. \nTEST PROCBNRB \nThe f i r s t  s e r i e s  of' t e s t s  was made on t e s t  u n i t  A t o  develop \na technique f o r  recording t he  pressure pulsa t ions  and t o  determine \nt h e  charas ter  of surging. An inses t igz t ion  was a l s o  made of t h e  \nr e l a t i v e  freqaency, magnitude, and phase r e l a t i o n s  of to ta l -pressure ,  \ns ta t ic-pressure ,  and velocity-pressure va r ia t ions  in  t h e  i n l e t  and \nt h e  o u t l e t  pipes of t he  s ~ s t e m .  \nInvest igat ions  were made on t e o t  un i t  6 t o  study t h e  character-  \ni s t i c s  of the  pulsat ion8 i n  t h e  severa l  unusual surge ranges encoun- \nt e r e d  during ?erformance t e s t s  of t h i s  u n i t .  Traces of t he  veloci ty  \npressure i n  both t he  i n l e t  and the  o u t l e t  pipes were taken slmul- \nt+aneously at  t he  standard measuring s t a t i o n s  t o  determine whether \nt h e  amplitude, t h e  wave form, and the  frequency of t he  pulsa t ions  \nwere t h e  s m e  f o r  a l l  surge ranges. \nOne s e r i e s  of t e s t s  on u n i t  C was  designed t o  determine how the  \nvolume of t he  p p e s  used with t h e  compressor influenced t h e  f r q u e n c y  \nand magnitude of surging. Ina,smuch a s  t heo re t i c a l l y  an i r f i n i t o  \nvolume of air is i n  motion, regardiess  of t he  sliape and s i z e  of t he  \npipes,  t h e  volume a f f ec t i ng  th'e surge cha rac t e r i s t  i c s  is d i f f i c u l t  \nt o  e s t ab l i sh  de f i n i t e l y .  I n  a conventional t e s t  un i t ,  a drop i n  \n?ressu-e f r o n  approximately t h a t  of t h e  l o c a l  a tmos~here  occurs at  \nt h e  i n l e t  t h r o t t l e ;  an increase in pressure occurs through t he  \nccmpressor; and a decrease i n  pressure t o  approximately t h a t  of t h e  \nl o c a l  atmosphere occurs at t he  o u t l e t  t h r o t t l e .  The l a rge s t  pa r t  of \nt h e  pressure cycle is thus obtained between the  i n l e t  and ou t l e t  \nt h r o t t l e s  and t he  vol.ume enclosed by t he  system between these  two \ns t a t i o n s  clay be considered t o  be t he  cha r ac t e r i s t i c  volume of t h e  \nsystem. This concept, however, may be expected t o  be most exact \nwhen t h e  pressure drop t h r o ~ g h ' t h e  t h r o t t l e s  is a maximum. A s  the  \narpssure  drop decreases, t he  influence of t h e  ex t e r i o r  regions b e c o ~ e s  \nmore pronounced. The volune was  the re fore  varied 3y using each of \n6 NACA TN No. 12 13 \nthree inlet conditions in conguncticn with each of three ou21et \nthrottle locat ions (fig . 2) ; thus nine different combinations af \ninlet and outlet conditions were tested. \nThe three inlet conditions were: \n1. Inlet throttle wide open (located 24 diameters upstream \nfrom the campressor inlet, station K) \n2. Inlet throttle partly closed (station K) \n3, Inlet pipes replaced by a nozzle at the compressor inlet \n(station L) \nThe three outlet conditicns were: \n1. Outlet throttle 51 ddameters downstream of compressor outlet \n(station A) , .  \n2. Outlet throttle 33 diameters downstream of comyressor outlet \n(station B) \n3. Outlet throttle replaced by a 3-inch gate valve at compressor \noutlet (station D) \nAll the tests to determine the effect of volume of the system on surg- \n, 4ng were made at an impeller tip speed of 960 feet per second. \nTests were also made on test unit C to determine the effect of \ntip speed on the chas-acteristics of surging. For these tests complute \ncompressor data and a number or\" velocity-pressure traces were talcen \na< several tip speeds. \nIn order to apply the results of the analysts of surging, the \nvariation of the pressure drq across the throttles with mass flow \nhad to be determined. The throttlc setting was maintained constant \nand the weight flow of air was varied over a w-ide range by varying \nthe impeller speed. The weight flow of air and the pressl.re drops \nacross the throttles were recorded. All tests were run at sea-level \nconditions with inlet-air tcmperstures from 6 8 O  to 100° F. \nEXPERIMEHTAL RESULTS \nCharacter of transition from stable operation to surging. - Tha \nvariations of the outlot total pressure with time for test unit A \nas the outlet throttle was gradually closed until audible surge \nNACA TN No, 1213 7 \noccurred is shown i n  f i gu re  4.

In general, this trend agrees \nwith the observqtions of p.revious investigations; that ie, a large \nexternal-system volume reeults in a low-frequency, high-amplitude \nvibration; whereas a small volume results in a high-frequency, low- \nmagnitude vibration. No .simple relation, however, could be found \nto express the fyeque;?cy as a function of the inlet and the outlet \nvolumes, which indicates that factors other than the effective volme \nalso control the surging characteristics. The pressure dro? across \nthe throttle and the inertia of the air in motion aust be considered. \nThe following table shows the effects 09 volume on frequency of \nsurge pulsations for test unit C: \ni Inlet cu ft)l- - \nvolume '- Frequency (c-ps) (CU ft)L \\.,; \nEffcjct of impeller tip speed on magnitude and frequency of ?res- \n--- \nsure pulsations during surging. - In the course of these investiga- \n-\ntions, additional tests were conducted on test unit C t6'detemine the \neffect of tip speed-on the magnitude and the frequency of the pressure \npulsation.

Although the ampl?tx&e of the pulsations \nis approximately doubled, the frequency is changed very little by an \nincrease in tip speed. Thfs result is representative of tests on \nother compressors. \nInstability of Flow in Compressors. \nTht2 results of the preeent ar,d previous inyestigations (refsr- \nences 1, 2, and 3) have shown that surging occurs only when the slope \nof the characteristic c7Jrve is positive and that the volume of air \nenclosed by the system has a definite effect on the frequency and the \nNAC A TN No. 12 13 11 \nmagnitude of the pressure variations. In addition, the variations \nin pressure and velocity during surging need not have a sinusoidal \nvariation with time. Tilese o'oservations indicate that surging is a \nself-induced vibration resulting from an inherent instability of \nthe flow in some p&rt of the operating range. The slope of the \ncharacteristic curTe is a criterion of the stability of the flow. \nInasmuch as the frequency and the ma~mitude of the pulsations are \naffected by the volue, this quantity aight also be expected to \nafi'ect the stability. Vibrations or\" this type seldom have purely \nsinusoidal qualities. \nThe general method used to study the stability of a given motion \nis to assumc that a small deviation from %he steady form of motion \nis produced and then to investigate whether the ensuing reactions \ntend. to oppose the deviation or accentuate it (references 7, pp, 32-35, \nand 8). The reactions are brought about by the inertia, elastic, and \nfrictional forces induced by the deviation, The inertia forces are a \nfunction of the rate of change of the velocity of the motion; the \nelastic forces are a function of the magnitude of the deviation \nitself; the frictional forces are a function of the velocity of the \n~otion. Because stability of the motion is the issue rather than the \nmotion itself, only the linear terms are considered. \nIn a compressor operating at constant speed, the inertia forces \nare due to changing the velocity of the C,otal Ease of alr in motion. \nElastic forces result from the elastic prozerty of air. Friclkional \nforces are (1) the true frictional force caused by skin friction and \nthrottling, and (2) the force that causes the pressure rise in the \ncompressor, which is, in a sense, a neg&tive friction force. These \nforces are interrelated in a co~plex manner and efforts to develog \nan analytical expression to describe the influence of these forces \nfor a general compressor systera indicated that the equations become \ngreatly involved. By the use of sim~lifying assumptions, however, \nan approximation was developed (see the appendix) to detarmine the \nrelative inflcence of the various forces affecting the stability of \nthe operation of a compressor. The derivation is somewhat limited \nbecause it is based on a simyle systeol of an inlet pipe, an inlet \nthrottle, and-a compressor unit, Further limitations are imposed on \nthe devclop&nt because of the following~simplifyfng assumptione: \n(1) The difference between the static prassure and the total \npressure is small. \n' (2 ) The pressure and the mass df stribution in the inlet pipe \nvary linearly zlong the pipe length, \n12 NACA TN No. 1213 \nt. \n(3) The volume of the compressor is negligible. \nTwo simu'ltaneous differential equations can be set up from \nthese as,sumptior_s,to btain the expr, -ssions \nand \n6Mc = K2 est sin ( w  + d2) \nwhere \n6Mi small changb of mass flow rate through inlet throttle \n6Mc small change of mass flow rate through compressor \nKlz K2 constants determining relative amplitude of vibratory motion \nfl lr  constants governing phase relation of vibratory motion \ns stability term \nt t ime . . \nuj frequency term \nOnly the exponefit s need be examined to investigate the sta- \nbility of the system.

The throttle characteristic curves represent \nthe variation of the total restrlctions to flow in the e-xternal \npiping with mass flow. When the disturbance causes the pressure \nrise through the compressor to exceed the pressure drop through the \nexker~al pi~ing, the mass flow will increase; coxversely, when the \nthrottle pressure drop is greater than the pressure rise of the \ncompressor, the mass flow will decrease.

Thus a finite time is \nrequired for the static pressure to adjust itself completely to the \nchange in flow conditions.

A sizable chamber'is connected to the flow \n.passage at the leading edges of the diffuser blades by means of \nvery mall orifices. If the positive slope of the compressor cume \nis due to a momentary breakdom in the flow at the diffuser tips, , \nthe resulting drog of pressure in this region will cause the chamker \nto discharge air into the passages and thus delay the rates of' cfiacge \nof the dscrease in the over-all pressure ratio. The effeztiveress \nof operation of an arrangement of this type will depend on the purpose \nfor which the compressor is to be ussd. \nA typical compessor installation for a modern aircraft engine \nhas a large number of components, each of which contributes its own \nparticular resistance, capacity, and inertia effects to the totals \nfor the system. The surge point,obuervsd during bench tests usually \ncorresponds. fairly closely to that found for the actual installation. \nA device for inhibiting surge by changing the response of the unit \nfor any one system, however, cannot be expected to function properly \nwhen used in another system where the resistance, the capacity, and \nthe inertia effects are greatly different. For this reason, investi- \ngatlons made to increase the surge-free range must be made on the \ncomplote installation with which %he compressor unit is to be used. \nSUIME;RY OF RESULTS \nThe results of experiments with thee compressor test rigs and \nanalytical studies of surge show that : \n1. As a rule, a transition region characterized by erratic \npulsations of small.mgnitude existed between the region of stable \noperation and the point where definite surging begins. \n2. The fact that the frequency of the pulsations thi-oughout the ' \nsystem was uniform indicated that the system surged as a unit. \n3. Although the pressure pulsations were periodic, their varia- \ntions with respect to time were frequently nonsinusoidal. \n4. Dccreasing the volumetric capacity of the external pipes \nincreased the frequency and decreased the uplitude of the pressure \npulsations. Apparently the frequency and the o::~rpiitude both de~ended \non a cbillplex relation of the capacity and the resistance of each \ncoxponent of the system. \nCONCLUSIONS \nFrom the foregoing results, the following conclusions have been \ndram: \n1. Surging is the mnLfestation of a instzbility of flow In a \ncompressor, If this condition is to exist, the slope oZ the \ncompressor chnmcteristic curve must be positive and a time interval \nmust exist between 3 change in flcw conditions in the compressor \npassages and the static-pressure adjustment in the external p-ipss. \n2. The surge-free range of any compressor may possibly be \nextended or the &?gnitude of the surging pulsations be reduced by \neither reducing the magnitude of the positive slope of the character- \nistic curvg or by changing the volumetric capacity of the compressor \ncomponellts. All such investigations should be mde on the actual \ninatallation with 'iili$ch the compressor is to be used. \nAi.rcraft Engine Research Lcboratory, \nNational Advisory Committee for Aeroi~utics, \nCleveland, Ohio, April 25, 1946, \nA!PPELvDIx -.

When a small \ndeviation or displacement from the state of equilibrium of a system \nis assumed, certain vibrations will occur that may be analytically \nstudied. If these vibrations have a tendency to die out, equilib- \nrium is maintained; otherwise, it is destroyed. In addition to the \ncompressor itself, a typical compressor installation contains one or \nmore throttling units and several lengths of piping. A rigorous \nanalysis of the stability of such a system requires a knowledge of \nthe distribution of the pressure, the temperature, and the velocity \nat each point in the system. \nAt present, a thorqugh study of the stability of any specific \nsystem is not so feasible as formulating a relation between the \nvarious factors affdcting stability and tbus obtaining information \non the fundamental causes of unstable operation. For simplicity, \na compressor system (fig. 15) consisting of an inlet throttle, an \ninlet pipe, and the compressor unit will be assumed. Air enters the \nthrottle directly from the atmosphere and is directly discharged \nfrom the compressor into the atmosphere. \nNACA TN No. 1213 \nRt equiiibriurn, ;;he drop in static pressure Apio across the \ninlet throttle is equal to the rise in static pressure bpco acrosd \nthe compessor (from the assmption that the difference between \nstatic and total pressure is smail). ' If A is assumed to be e \nfunction of the mass flow Mi through the throttle, the occurrence \nof- a disturbance that causes a small change EMi In the main flow \nwill cause the pressure drsp across the;throttle to become \nand \nThis disturbance may or may not be equal to that through the throttle. \nAt any instant, the static pressure p2 i;mnediately.downstream \nof the throttle must be equal to the difference between the pressure \np1 of the atmosphere and Ape. Similarly, the pressure pg imme- \ndiately upstream of the compressor must equal the difference between \npl. and Apt. These requirements provide the relation \nWhen the values of Api and Ap, determined in equations (2) and \n(3) are substf tuted, \nThe displacements assumed for studying the stability of the system \nare so smll {hat x and y may be treated as constants. \nThe existence of this difference in pressure at the two extrem- \nities of the inlet pipe will change the momentum of the mass of air \nenclosed by the inlet pipe. If friction forces are neglected, the \nrate of change of momentum will equal the product of the pressure \ndifference by the area of the pipe.

The expressions for s and o are \nand \n'As previously stated, when the-sign of s is negative, the \nvibrations are diminished as time passes and:%he operation is stable. \nOn the other hand, a positive value of s results in unstable oper- \nation.

"Abstract. We discuss a model limit problem which arises as a first step in the mathematical justification of our Boussinesq-type approximation [4], which takes into account dissipative heating in natural convection. We treat a simplified highly non linear system depending on a (perturbation) para-meter ε. The main difficulty is that for ε  = 0 the velocity is not solenoidal. First we prove that our system has weak solutions for each fixed ε. More-over, while the chosen perturbation parameter ε tends to zero we show, that we arrive at the usual incompressible case and the standard Boussinesq approximation"
"Standard rate equation models of island formation in the InAs/GaAs(001) system have been reassessed in terms of new experimental evidence from real time in-situ reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) measurements. These measurements have revealed the behaviour and role of the wetting layer in the modified Stranski-Krastanov growth mode during molecular beam epitaxial growth showing that it can continue to significantly increase in thickness following the onset of islanding. The presence of two dimensional (2D) islands, which act as precursors to three dimensional (3D) islands (the quantum dots) in conventional models, does in principle allow an extension of the \"wetting layer\". However, it has been found necessary to extend the standard model to include extra terms that allow material to be incorporated into (and detach from) the wetting layer and which cannot convert to 3D islands. With this improved model, it is found possible to achieve agreement with the RAS measurements"

"575 Vol. 3, No. 4, October–December 1997 Emerging Infectious Diseases\nCommentary\nIrradiation Pasteurization of Solid\nFoods: Taking Food Safety to the Next\nLevel\nIn the 19th century, milk from diseased cattle\nproduced in unsanitary surroundings and\ndistributed under filthy conditions to an\nincreasingly urbanized population sickened and\nkilled consumers by the thousands (1,2). Wide\nacceptance of the germ theory and the sanitary\nawakening that followed led to vast improve-\nments in animal health and hygiene, and the\nsafety of dairy products improved substantially.\nDairy farmers in northern Europe discovered\nthat heating milk fed to their calves further\nreduced the risk for tuberculosis in their herds,\nand after overcoming concerns that the new\nthermal pasteurization technology would corrupt\nthe dairy industry, destroy the nutritional value\nof milk, and lead to serious public health\nproblems, the same level of protection was offered\nto human consumers a few decades later (3,4).\nMore recently, thermal pasteurization has been\nsuggested for eliminating low level contamina-\ntion of juice by foodborne pathogens (5,6).\nHowever, for the safety of solid foods that enter\nkitchens as raw agricultural commodities,\nincluding meat, poultry, and seafood, we\ncontinue to rely solely on animal health programs\nand sanitation. Therefore, as we approach the\n21st century, preventable illness and death\ncaused by vegetative bacterial and parasitic\nfoodborne pathogens remain substantial public\nhealth problems (7,8).\nIrradiation pasteurization of solid foods with\nlow doses of gamma rays, X-rays, and electrons\nwill effectively control vegetative bacterial and\nparasitic foodborne pathogens (9-11). Public\nconcerns, similar to those raised against thermal\npasteurization of milk, have been advanced in\nopposition to irradiation pasteurization, and it\nhas been claimed that if we but paid more\nattention to sanitation and proper cooking, these\nproducts could be safely consumed without\nintroducing new technologies.\nPerhaps. However, the residual risk for\ninfection that remains after state-of-practice\nsanitation during production, harvest, process-\ning, distribution, and preparation yields an\nunacceptable level of illness and death. In\naddition, the admonition to properly cook works\nonly if culturally acceptable food preferences do\nnot include undercooked and raw foods.\nIncreased interest (encouraged by the public\nhealth and nutrition community) in fresh\nproduce as part of a high fiber, low fat diet,\nfurther reduces the effectiveness of proper\ncooking as a disease control strategy (12).\nRecent outbreaks of foodborne illness associ-\nated with undercooked meat and uncooked fresh\nproduce, and the emergence of the previously\nunrecognized foodborne hazards that spawned\nthe conference whose proceedings are reported in\nthis issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, have\nstimulated interest in methods of pasteurizing\nsolid food without altering its raw appearance\nand characteristics. Research is under way on a\nvariety of promising approaches, including\npulsed energy, bright light, high pressure, and\nother nonthermal technologies, but few are ready\nfor immediate application (13,14; Fed Reg\n61:42381-83, 1997). Irradiation pasteurization,\non the other hand, is a well-established process\nwith clearly documented safety and efficacy that\ncan be put into widespread use as quickly as\nfacilities can be sited and built (15).\nGood practice guidelines and Hazard Analy-\nsis and Critical Control Points programs\n(HACCP) can result in raw meat, poultry,\nseafood, and produce with sufficiently low levels\nof pathogen contamination that irradiation doses\nas low as 1 to 3 kGy yield adequate margins of\nsafety for common foodborne pathogens such as\nCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia\ncoli, Listeria, Salmonella, and Toxoplasma (9).\nNo other control for Campylobacter contamina-\ntion of poultry meat is apparent, and other\napproaches to ground beef safety have proven\ninadequate to prevent intermittent low level\ncontamination with E. coli O157:H7. Likewise, no\nother solutions are immediately available to\ncontrol pathogen contamination of produce\nintended for raw consumption, and irradiation\ndoses used appear adequate for the bacterial and\nparasitic pathogens involved in recent outbreaks\n(Donald Thayer, pers. comm.)\nThe food industry appears reluctant to fully\nembrace irradiation pasteurization despite the\nobvious and painful failure of alternative\napproaches to prevent foodborne infections.\nMuch of this reluctance stems from the\nperception that consumers reject the process and\nwill refuse to buy irradiated food. Indeed, surveys\nhave shown considerable consumer confusion\nand ignorance about food irradiation (16), and576 Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 3, No. 4, October–December 1997\nCommentary\nreports on public antipathy toward things\nradioactive abound. However, consumer surveys\nalso demonstrate profound and growing public\nconcern about microbial food safety, and\ndecreasing concerns about the safety of irradi-\nated food (17). Knowing as little about it as they\nappear to, approximately half of the consumers\nsurveyed have expressed willingness to try\nirradiated food if it will decrease their risk for\nillness (16). In addition, when educated about\nfood irradiation, 90% of survey participants\nexpressed interest in purchasing irradiated\nfoods; sampling such food increased interest to\n99% (18).\nIrradiation pasteurization is not the cure for\nall food safety ills. Pasteurization of any sort is no\nmatch for bad sanitation and substandard\npractices, and irradiation pasteurization can be\noverwhelmed by large numbers of pathogens.\nJust as obviously, foods produced and processed\nunder appropriate conditions that are then\nproperly packaged and irradiated are subject to\npostpasteurization contamination. In addition,\nthe doses of irradiation used to pasteurize fresh\nmeat and poultry are not sufficient to kill\nbacterial spores. Thus, if anaerobic packaging is\nthe method used to protect irradiated foods from\npostpasteurization contamination, Clostridium\nbotulinum could pose a risk if the cold chain is\ndisrupted.\nVibrio infections associated with consump-\ntion of raw molluscan shellfish can be prevented\nwith irradiation pasteurization, but the Norwalk-\nlike viruses also frequently associated with raw\nshellfish appear to be more radioresistant than\nvegetative bacterial pathogens. Levels of irradia-\ntion an order of magnitude greater than\npasteurizing doses for meat and poultry also are\nnecessary to inactivate hepatitis A virus. To\nreduce the risk for foodborne hepatitis A and\nNorwalk virus infections, it will be necessary to\nreduce the level of exposure of food to human\nfeces. This is true regardless of whether or not\nfoods are to be pasteurized. Although irradiation\npasteurization will not eliminate all seafood-\nborne pathogens, it will reduce the potential of\nseafood to cause illness. Seafood HACCP and\nadvances in viral diagnostics and environmental\nvirology will help ensure that prepasteurization\nconditions are sufficient to yield seafood\nappropriate for irradiation pasteurization (19,20).\nJust as thermal pasteurization works well for\nliquid foods like milk and juice, but not for solid\nfoods for which raw characteristics are desired,\nirradiation pasteurization works well for meat,\npoultry, seafood, and soft fruit, but wilts leafy\nvegetables and sprouts. That irradiation pasteur-\nization does not work for every food and every\npathogen is poor justification for not applying it\nfor those food/pathogen combinations for which it\nhas been shown to work so well.\nConsumer surveys have demonstrated public\nconcerns over worker and environmental safety\nthat have also contributed to the reluctance of\nsome to build and use food irradiation facilities.\nThese concerns are appropriate and addressable.\nBecause food irradiation and irradiation steril-\nization of nonfood items like medical supplies are\nso well established, proper facilities design and\noperating characteristics are well known. The\nrelatively short half-life of Cobalt 60 and its\ninsolubility in water reduce environmental\nconcerns, which can be eliminated altogether by\nusing electricity-generated X-rays and electron\nbeams instead of a radioactive source. Proper\neducation and training has protected employees\nof irradiation sterilization facilities; employees of\nfood irradiation facilities should not be qualita-\ntively different from other employees in similar\nindustries.\nThus, a broadly applicable solution to many\nof our food safety problems exists and has existed\nfor a number of decades. It is disappointing that\nthe public health community has been so silent\nfor so long on this issue. Faced with the liability of\nmarketing hazardous foods, it is puzzling why the\nfood industry has not stepped into the vacuum\ncreated by this lack of leadership from public\nhealth. Presentations at the Conference on\nEmerging Foodborne Pathogens make it clear\nthat new foodborne hazards are being stacked on\ntop of old, unresolved food safety problems—\nbroadly applicable solutions are desperately\nneeded. Just as thermal pasteurization of milk\nprotected us from E. coli O157:H7 before we knew\nit was in raw milk, irradiation pasteurization can\nprotect us from tomorrow’s emerging foodborne\npathogen.\nMichael T.

"Three applications of Smith's model of magneto-optical effects in stratified magnetic media are presented. Each application involves the incident-angle dependence of magneto-optical effects which Smith's model treats explicitly. In addition. the three applications address current issues in magnetic and magneto-optical recording. The first problem considered is that of nonmagnetic surface layers which form on magnetic recording heads. The second is a theoretical treatment of effects which arise in magneto-optical recording when high numerical-aperture optical systems are combined with media exhibiting interference-enhanced optical properties. The final application is a novel technique for determining the entire dielectric tensor of materials used for magneto-optical recording. The incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect is employed to study nonmagnetic surface layers which form on ferrite recording heads. Calculations based on the Smith model show a correlation between the inert-layer thickness and the incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect. Experimental results confirm the shift in the angular position of the signal peak. in agreement with the theory for finite inert-layer thickness. An unambiguous determination of the inert-layer thickness for ferrite materials is prevented because of a periodic dependence of the peak angle on the inert-layer thickness. Jones-matrix algebra is used with the Smith model to quantitatively determine the effects of obliquely-incident rays on the reflectance and magneto-optical readout signals for various magneto-optical media structures. The most antireflective structure is found to be very sensitive to incident-angle effects. Structures with moderate reflectance (>10%). however. are not significantly affected by incident-angle effects. Finally. a technique for the determination of the optical and magneto-optical constants from multiple incident-angle measurements of reflectance and Kerr rotation is presented. The experimental system employs a Helium-Neon laser and a rotating differential detection system. The technique is used to investigate the optical properties of a series of Cu/Co multilayers and a comparison with a model based on the bulk optical. constants of Cu and Co is made. Anomalous behavior is observed for multilayers with very thin periods"
"Three reports prepared for TAC on marginal lands: the report of a panel asked to look at research priorities, and follow up studies on prioritizing land types, and the relationship between rural poverty and land degradation. The document contains an excerpt from the summary of CGIAR ICW 99, a transmittal from the TAC Chair, and TAC's commentary.'The Report of the Study on CGIAR Research Priorities for Marginal Lands' (March 1997) by a panel chaired by Michael Nelson explores the interaction between poverty and land quality. Faced with conceptual and data problems, the panel rejected the assumption that poor people were overly concentrated in low potential areas, and focused on how the CGIAR might more systematically address poverty alleviation. It recommended creation of a database linking poverty to biophysical land conditions. New forms of partnership and new approaches would be needed to address the needs of poor people living in marginal areas, the impacts of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on natural resources, the linkages between poverty and resource degradation, and the reasons why improved technology often remained unused. The panel recognized that it was recommending a broadening of research that would require increased resources.'A Framework for Prioritizing Land Types in Agricultural Research' (August 1998) prepared on behalf of TAC by Ted Henzell, develops the principles of land classification from the Marginal Lands Study into a conceptual framework for more general use in CGIAR priority-setting.'Rural Poverty and Land Degradation: A Reality Check for the CGIAR' (August 1998) by Sohail Malik reviews the literature on the relationship between rural poverty and land degradation, and implications for priority setting by CGIAR centers.This subject was on the agenda of TAC at every meeting from TAC 70 through TAC 77, and was considered at the CGIAR meeting in October 1999"

The panel \nreviewed the conventional thinking about the nature of marginal lands, the concentration of \nrural poverty on such lands, the linkage between poverty and accelerated resource \ndegradation, and the CGIAR’s role in poverty alleviation on these lands. \nThe panel did not have the data to quantify the numbers of rural poor on areas \nspecified by the sets of elements which explain why they are marginal. Thus the panel’s \nconclusions are general and no specific inferences are drawn on potential gains in poverty \nalleviation from research investment on marginal lands to develop new technologies, j \nunderstand farm and off-farm linkages in family survival strategies, and assess constraints \nand opportunities for changes in policies and institutions seen as hindering poverty \nalleviation. The panel made four recommendations regarding CGIAR work in marginal \nareas. \nl The CGIAR should sharpen its strategic focus on poverty alleviation, particularly \nin setting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas. \nl Centers should establish new partnerships to effectively address their roles in a \nbroader poverty alleviation strategy for those who live in marginal areas. : \nl The CGIAR should develop improved mechanisms to generate and imerpret \nscientific evidence on the extent and magnitude of agriculture’s impact on \nresource degradation or enhancement and the linkage between poverty and \nresource degradation. \nl Centers and their partners should expand collaborative mechanisms to adapt and \nutilize heretofore-unused research results. \nTAC Chair Donald Winkelmann presented the TAC commentary.

The evidence neither confirms nor rejects the conventional wisdom that \nmost of the rural poor are located in areas characterized by marginal lands and that marginal \nlands are more susceptible to resource degradation. It is simply inconclusive. More research, \nsometimes specific to a target area, is needed before marginal areas can be targeted to achieve \nCGIAR objectives and before research allocation schemes are developed that take land types \ninto account. \nPlenary Decisions \nMembers noted the panel’s difficulties in showing casual links between poverty and \nland degradation and whether targeting degraded land selectively also targets poverty. It was \nnoted that the panel’s analysis indicates that some marginal lands have significant potential \nfor research-driven productivity increases, so that returns on investment in those areas could \nsurQass the short-term potential in more favored areas. \nConsultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) \nTECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE \nDonald Winkelmann, Chairman \nSeptember 30, 1999 \nDear Mr. Serageldin, \nI am pleased to transmit to you the reports of TAC’s Study on Marginal Lands. The Study \ncomprises four papers: the first was prepared by a Panel chaired by Dr. Mike Nelson and is \nentitled Report of the Study on CGIAR Research Priorities for Marginal Lands; the second \nwas prepared by Dr. Ted Henzell and the TAC Secretariat and is entitled A Frameworkfor \nPrioritizing Land Types in Agricultural Research; the third was prepared by a Consultant to \nthe TAC Secretariat, Dr. Sohail Malik, and is entitled Rural Poverty and Land Degradation: \nA Reality Checkfor the CGIAR; TAC’s Commentary on this Study is the fourth paper. \nThis is an especially rich mixture of papers, the last two of them stimulated by the ideas \nemerging from the first. The collection has strong implications for the way the System \nprioritizes its efforts on less favoured environments. The overall conclusion of the Study is \nthat the information available is insufficient to support the presumption that the character of \nmarginal lands can be used to set research priorities that meet CGIAR objectives. In its \ncommentary, TAC refers to a number of immediate implications of the results of this Study \nfor Centre and System research planning.

Motivations for the Marginal Lands Study \nCGIAR research is driven by the objectives of reducing poverty, enhancing food security, \nand promoting sustainability in the management of natural resources such as biodiversity, land, \nand water. The instruments it uses to achieve these goals are the provision and diffusion \n(particularly through training) of technological and institutional innovations to enhance the \nproductivity and the sustainability of use of land and other natural resources. The technological \ninnovations which the CGIAR generates tend to be specific to particular biophysical contexts: \nwhile some innovations are broadly generic, particularly if they pertain to fundamental research, \nmost are applicable to specific contexts defined by a broad set of biological and physical features. \nFor rural poverty reduction, contextual specificity then raises the possibility of targeting the rural \npoor by focusing research on the geographical areas with biophysical features where the poor are \nmost heavily concentrated. Poverty concentration would mean not that there is a high incidence \nof poverty among the population in that area (where population may be very scarce), but that \nthere is a high percentage of all rural poor located in the area. If, as conventional wisdom has it, \nmost of the rural poor are located in areas characterized by marginal lands, then focusing CGIAR \nresearch on technological innovations for marginal lands would be an effective way of achieving \nthe goal of rural poverty reduction. If, in addition, marginal lands are more susceptible to \nresource degradation, then the objective of sustainable natural resources management (NRM) \nwould also be well served by focusing research on these areas. Also, if the poor themselves are a \nsource of environmental degradation, and as poverty shortens time horizons and constrains the \nadoption of instruments that would enhance conservation, then technological innovations for \nmarginal lands can help achieve win-win outcomes, with synergy between the goals of poverty \nreduction and sustainable NRM. Finally, if we suspect that there has been an initial under- \ninvestment by the CGIAR in research for marginal areas, i.e., over-investment in Green \nRevolution varieties that favoured the complementary input package found mainly in areas of \nhigh quality land, then a high uncaptured potential return to research on marginal lands may exist. \nBecause this argument apparently offered much promise, TAC took initiatives to address \nthe issue through systematic analysis of existing evidence. Interest in the issue was prompted by \nrecommendations derived from the February 1995 ministerial-level meeting held in Lucerne, and \nthe IFPRI 2020 Vision paper, that the CGIAR should “ensure that its research programmes \naddress the problems of the poor in less-endowed areas, in addition to continuing its work on \nhigh potential areas”. This international concern for the less-endowed areas was driven by \nperceptions that the CGIAR’s research efforts have done little for the poor in biophysically \nmarginal lands, that most of the poor live in areas which are ecologically fragile, and that they are \na cause and consequence of a downward spiral of resource degradation and deepening poverty. \nTAC appointed a distinguished panel of experts, chaired by Dr. Mike Nelson, to look into \nthe validity of the presumptions. The Committee also appointed a separate consultant, Dr. Sohail \nMalik, to review specifically what is known about the relationship between rural poverty and land \ndegradation. These two documents prompted a response by Dr. Ted Henzell who proposed an \n2 \nalternative framework for prioritizing land types for the allocation of CGIAR research funds. \nThese studies, sponsored by TAC, constitute a strategic initiative designed at improving the \nCGIAR’s ability to set priorities and allocate resources to research. Marginal or fragile land was \ndefined as land that is sensitive to degradation as a result of human intervention, and degraded \nland as land that has lost part of, or its entire, productive capacity as a result of human \nintervention. \nThe overall conclusion of this effort is that information is generally lacking to support the \npresumption that the character of marginal lands could be used to set research priorities that focus \nclearly on poverty alleviation. This, in itself, is an interesting conclusion since it calls into \nquestion conventional wisdom, which if followed, would lead to erroneous decision-making in \nallocating research resources. The evidence neither confirms nor rejects the conventional \nwisdom; it is simply inconclusive. This in turn suggests fertile areas for future research which the \nCGIAR and others concerned with poverty should address. \nII. Results from the Marginal Lands Studies \nThe Nelson Panel concluded that there is “an abysmal lack of data” to validate the two \npresumptions that motivated the study, i.e., (1) that marginal lands support a high proportion of \nthe rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor, and (2) that the poor are the prime cause of \nresource degradation in marginal agricultural lands. In addition, it does not appear correct to say \nthat the CGIAR under-invested research funds for these lands, even though there is no impact \nanalysis showing whether these investments were effective for the goal of rural poverty \nreduction. We note too that there is still some confusion in characterizihg poverty in marginal \nlands between incidence of poverty (it does not appear to be higher in these lands relative to \nfavourably endowed lands) and number of poor (it appears to be higher in more favoured lands \nsimply because population densities are so much higher than in marginal lands). Clearly, as far as \nthe CGIAR is concerned, the second type of measure is the relevant one. Data, however, remain \ninconclusive on both measures of poverty and the Panel concluded that further research using \navailable evidence could not disentangle these issues. It concluded that the focus on marginal \nlands may not be appropriate in guiding the CGIAR’s strategy toward poverty alleviation. \nIn seeking an alternative concept to help target CGIAR research using a geographical \ncriterion, the Panel proposed the idea of “marginal area”. Such area is defined as a geographical \nunit characterized by a high incidence of “marginal people” and relatively homogeneous \ndeterminants of poverty. As TAC understands it, “marginal people” refers to marginalized \npeople, with poverty as the dominant common consequence of marginalisation. Starting hence \nfrom marginality, the question is whether one can identify relatively homogeneous regions in \nterms of causation of poverty, whether the region is characterized by marginal lands or not. \nIt would seem correct to start the analysis f?om poverty, identifying the many \ndeterminants of poverty, and potentially singling out the quality of the biophysical environment \nas one of these determinants. If the biophysical determination of poverty turned out to be \nsufficiently strong, then a research effort to generate technological innovations for these areas \nwould be justified. On the other hand, among the other determinants of poverty, there may be \nindicators that could prove to be more powerful than land type in setting research priorities to \n2 \nreduce rural poverty. Since data are generally not available, the validity of the Panel’s proposed \nalternative criterion remains to be tested. \nLack of data may seem surprising since the World Bank has run extensive Living \nStandard Measurement Surveys with the objective of tracking poverty. These data, however, \nwere not collected in association with relevant biophysical characteristics. Hence, statistical \nrepresentation is not achieved over geographical units that can be characterized as marginal \nlands, and geographical representation is over regions that are in general too broad and \nheterogeneous to usefully fit a biophysical characterisation. \nBased on these findings, the Nelson Panel made four recommendations. The first \nrecommendation is that “the CGIAR needs to sharpen its strategic focus on poverty allevianon, \nparticularly in setting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas.’ A prerequisite is \ndevelopment of a geo-referenced database linking land‘conditions with poverty and the processes \nthat produce it (i.e., the dynamics of poverty)“. TAC endorses this recommendation. The CGIAR \nshould in particular use the expertise in the now operational. Consortium on Spatial Information \n(CSI) which TAC was instrumental in helping organ&e. This consortium has as one of its major \nobjectives the improved mapping of the locus and level of poverty. TAC consequently intends to \nbe a conscientious observer and potentially ‘an active p,articipant in the work of CSI and to play a \nrole in using results from this work to guide the CGIAR toward better spatially targeted resource \nallocations. \nRecommendation 2 is that ‘Centres should establish new forms of partnership in order to \neffectively address their role in a broader poverty alleviation strategy related to those who live in \nmarginal areas”. TAC concurs with the Panel that the determinants of poverty are multiple, that \npoverty reduction consequently requires focusing on an array of sources of income that go \nbeyond agriculture, and that this should be achieved via partnerships with organizations engaged \nin combating poverty with other instruments. The CGIAR is partially addressing this \nrecommendation through its ecoregional approach to research and also through the Systemwide \nProgramme on Participatory Research and Gender Analysis for Technology .Development and \nInstitutional Innovation, but greater efforts clearly need to be made toward implementing this \nrecommendation, e.g. with those studying income from off-farm employment. \nRecommendation 3 is that the CGIAR System should “develop improved mechanisms by \nwhich Centres can be involved with other partners in generating and interpreting improved \nscientific evidence on (1) the extent and magnitude of the impacts of agriculture, forestry, and \nfisheries on the degradation or enhancement of natural resources and the consequences for \nproduction, and food security; and (2) the linkage between poverty and observed resource \ndegradation”. TAC is indeed concerned that insufficient resources are devoted to.problems of soil \nand water degradation apart from the corresponding Systemwide undertaking. This \nrecommendation deseties further consideration by TAC. Meanwhile, IAEG is undertaking a \nspecial study to identify the determinants of these gaps and opportunities for intervention. \nFinally, recommendation 4, is that “expanded collaborative mechanisms and activities \nshould be developed among Centres and between Centres and their non-CGIAR partners, to help \nfocus research and institution strengthening on issues related to adoption, adaptation, and \n4 \nutilization *of research results that so far have remained unused”. Existence of a continued \nbacklog of un- or under-used research results has indeed been a long-standing concern, and most \nparticularly in the field of NRM. This issue is addressed in the Review of Systemwide \nProgrammes with an Ecoregional Approach (SDR/TAC:IAR/99/8). \nBecause the Nelson Panel was unable to fully address the question of links between rural \npoverty and land degradation, TAC asked Dr. Sohail Malik to review available literature on the \nsubject. His report concluded with a note of caution about our ability to verify this relationship. \nHe wrote that “understanding of the intricate process of poverty and land degradation is \nextremely limited. Definition, in each process, is driven largely by the perceptions of those \nanalysing the phenomena. The lack of clear conceptualization, the observed: heterogeneity, and \nthe diverse perceptions of those attempting the exercise complicate attempts at measurement. The \naggregate information available is not very useful for making judgements about poverty and land \ndegradation. Evidence from the few available micro-level studies is mixed. and contradictory. \nMuch more research in a variety of settings over a reasonable length of time is needed for deeper \nunderstanding of household (and community) decision-making processes, especially in terms of \nthe relationship with land. The CGIAR is well placed to support such research”. TAC agrees with \nthis observation and recommendation. There is clearly no simplistic characterization of the link \nbetween- poverty and natural resource degradation. What is needed is a set of conditional \nstatements on this link that establish when the relation may hold or not and why. This defines an \nimportant research area which the CGIAR is well placed to address. \nIll. Toward a Framework for Prioritizing Land Types in Agricultural Research \nDeveloping methodologies for the allocation of resources to research is a fundamental \nresponsibility of TAC. In its own approach to resource allocation, TAC uses a formula that \nconsiders the poverty weighted value of commodities and sectors, subjectively weighted by the \nprobability of success in research, themselves based on an assessment of changes in science. The \nNelson Panel addressed the issue of how to take into account the category of land (particularly \nmarginal versus favoured agricultural lands) in allocating resources. It proposed a two-way \nclassification of lands, with the present value of land use on one axis and the potential for \nexpansion of production through research on the other. Marginal agricultural lands with high \npotential to expand production based on research would thus deserve attention. This framework \nwas generalized by Dr. Ted Henzell using as classification dimensions the value of present use of \na land type and the potential benefits fi-om investment in agricultural research. Benefits from and \nvalue of use can thus go beyond production to include, for example, total factor productivity, \npoverty reduction, and indicators of natural resource management. \nThese frameworks present ways to consider the problem. Their implementation is still far \nbeyond what can be done at the moment, for the very same reasons that prevented the Nelson \nPanel and the Malik study from reaching conclusions about the meaning of marginal lands for \ntargeting CGIAR research in fulfihnent of its objectives. Data on the mapping between land types \nand poverty are largely missing, and studies of the potential impact of research on each land type \nare incomplete. Hence, developing and implementing a camework for prioritizing land types in \nagricultural research will have to wait for the required information to become available. To a \n5 \nlarge extent, the type of information that becomes available will determine the framework that \ncan be used. \nIV. Conclusions and Future Research \nThe TAC study on marginal lands has shown that more research, sometimes specific to a \ntarget area, is needed before those marginal areas can be targeted to achieve CGIAR objectives \nand before research resource allocation schemes are developed that take land types into account. \nThe Committee consequently recommends that such decisions be deferred until further \ninformation becomes available. At the same time, Centres and others should be encouraged to \nengage in research that accelerates generation of this information since it remains a fundamental \nissue for the CGIAR. TAC itself has a direct interest in accessing this information in order to \nimprove its instruments for resource allocation in the CGIAR. It will consequently be looking for \nopportunities to expedite the generation of this information within the limits of its role and \nresources. Meanwhile, TAC underlines the need for broadly based agricultural growth as a \nprerequisite for poverty reduction. \nThe study on Marginal Lands has several immediate implications for Centre and System \nresearch planning. \nl At the global level, the lack of correlation between land resource endowments and poverty, \nbased on available data, has led TAC, with Member approval, to propose a logfiame \nclassification that does not separate outputs by land type at the System level. However, \nCentres are encouraged to consider specific targeting at the ecoregional level where evidence \nsupports the belief that the correlation between the ecoregion and poverty may hold. \nl Given the lack of proof of causal effects between poverty and land degradation, it is logical to \nproceed on the assumption that threatening land use practices and technologies cause resource \ndegradation irrespective of who employs them. The targeting of degraded land does not \nselectively target poverty in most instances. \nl The analysis indicates that there are areas of marginal land that may, in fact, have a \nsignificant potential for research-driven productivity increases, and that the returns on \ninvestment in these areas may equal or surpass short-term potential on more favoured areas. \nTargeting of resources on these lands should consequently help the allocation of resources in \nterms of productivity gains. \nl To optimize the allocation of research funds between marginal and favoured agricultural \nlands for the purpose of poverty reduction, the key criterion is the marginal effect of research \nexpenditures on poverty in each type of land. To date, there is little evidence of the \nmeasurement of these marginal effects and this issue deserves urgent attention. \nl Lessons should be drawn from CGIAR success stories in marginal areas, specifically, in \nidentifying those factors (e.g., technical assistance, access to credit) which complement centre \nresearch to enable poor farmers to adopt technological innovations in marginal areas. \nl Investment in GIS applications would have significant payoff in assisting the targeting of \nmarginal resource ecoregions with potential for productivity increase, and in identifying areas \nof poverty and marginal lands. \n6 \nTAC closes its report by raising four key issues which will guide future research and \nresource allocation decisions for reducing poverty directly and indirectly: \n1. Potential of biotechnoloav and aaroforestrv for the marginal lands \nOne of the defining features of the Green Revolution was that the new seeds fared better \nwith complementary input packages including water, fertilizers, and chemicals for crop \nprotection. Hence, there was complementarity between the new technologies and quality of the \nresource endowment. For this reason, Green Revolution innovations tierle better suited for \nfavoured agricultural lands, and research for marginal lands appeared to offer a lower rate of \nreturn. Subsequent innovations, with a perspective on the poor and marginal lands, sought to help \nsubstitute for resources rather than pursuing complementarities. These innovations can, for \nexample, complement pesticide use (genetic resistance), fertilizers (nitrogen fixation), tillage \npractices, and water (drought resistance). Biotechnology, e.g., genetic maps and markers, \npossibly GMOs, noti offers the promise of making it faster and less costly to achieve these goals. \nFollowing this logic, technological innovations derived .via biotechnology and applied to \nparticular contexts through GIS mapping may promise higher rates of return for marginal areas \nthan earlier technology did. How this potential will materialize thus deserves significant \nattention. \n. \nIn deciding on research investments for marginal lands, the comparative advantage of \nthese regions needs to be carefully established. Some evidence from Asia points at the potential \n. \nof agroforestry and of the production of cash crops as activities that have such a comparative \nadvantage. In its efforts to reduce rural poverty, the CGIAR could consider extending its current \nportfolio to include activities with high potential for poverty reduction in marginal lands. \n2. Determinants of novertv \nPoverty in marginal lands is a complex phenomenon, where access to productive assets, \npublic goods investments, institutional arrangements, and cultural and social factors are all \nimportant determinants. Hence,. a cautious analysis of the determinants of rural poverty in \nmarginal areas needs to be made, with a full accounting of the role of different factors including \nthe biophysical context and the. technological practices used. Caution, however, must be \nexercised as a technological solution may not be the cost effective answer. It is quite possible that \nother constraints are more limiting on welfare than productivity in resource use as determined by \ntechnology. Hence, a comprehensive effort needs to be made to identify the specific determinants \nof poverty in marginal lands as well as the return from investing in agricultural research \ncompared to other types of interventions such as infi-astructure, improved control over assets \n(human capital in particular), and designing the institutional f&nework. Understanding the \npotential of agricultural technology for the marginal areas consequently deserves a broad \ninterdisciplinary effort before resources are committed to research on technological innovations \nspecialized to these areas. Given the large degree of heterogeneity of situations, this research \nneeds to be done at the local and regional level, followed by comparative analysis to seek broader \ngeneralizations. 0 \n7 \n3. Locus and manninp of the noor \nHaving access to reliable and well-documented data on the number and location of the \npoor is essential in identifying viable strategies to alleviate poverty. Several institutions are \nalready engaged in activities to identify specific areas of poverty concentration and to map their \nagroecological characteristics. CGIAR Members should actively support their efforts and ensure \nthat a coordinated and comprehensive plan is followed. \n4. Marginal Lands and Water \nInadequate attention has been given to research issues related to marginal lands potential, \ndefined in relation to water, cost of trade supporting infrastructure, and distance to markets. The \nCGIAR is well positioned to address water/land/poverty linkages beyond irrigation. Water \ninsecurity appears to be a main poverty feature in marginal lands of arid areas and hillsides. \nImprovement efforts for marginal lands should continue to recognize explicitly the scope for \nsupply and demand of water, the management of its use, and access to water especially by the \npoor. \nSDR/TAC:IAIU96/18.1 \n. \nCONSULTATIVE GROUP ON INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL, RESEARCH \nTECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE \nREPORT OF THE \nSTUDY ON CGIAR RESEARCH PRIORITIES \nFOR MARGINAL LANDS \nTAC SECRETARIAT \nFOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS \nMarch 1997 \nCasilla 209- 12 \nSantiago \nCHILE \n3 March 1997 \n’ Dear Dr. Winkelmann, \nI am pleased to submit the report on CGIAR Priorities for Marginal Lands. The \nearlier version discussed at TAC 71 has been revised in light of that discussion and further \nexchange of views among members of the Panel. The revision is based exclusively on \nclarification of the concept of “marginal land” which changed drastically between Phase I and \nII and was modified further in the final report as a result of the above discussions. In \nconsequence, Chapters 1 to 3 of the Phase II report were changed. However, the strategic \nelements (Chapters 5, 6 and 7) and the overall conclusions remain essentially unchanged. \nAt the outset I would like to trace the evolution of the Panel’s thinking, starting from \nfour tenets of conventional wisdom on: the nature of marginal lands; the concentration of \nrural poverty on such lands; the linkage between poverty and accelerated resource \ndegradation; and the role of CGIAR research in poverty alleviation on these lands. \nThis line of thinking holds that: \nmarginal lands are defined in biophysical terms which establish them as: having low \ninherent productivity for agriculture; being susceptible to degradation; and involving \nhigh risks for agricultural production; \nthey support a high proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor; \nthe combination of fragility and high density of poor people who place a premium on \ncurrent consumption (resulting in over-exploitation of natural resources) is leading to \naccelerated erosion or vegetation destruction; the consequence is a downward spiral \nof poverty and resource degradation with significant negative externalities; \nthe impact of CGIAR research on agricultural productivity increase, environmental \nprotection and, above all, poverty alleviation, has been limited on these areas. \n. ../2 \nDr. Donald Winkelmann \nChair \nTechnical Advisory Committee (TAC) \n355 East Palace Avenue \nSanta Fe, NM 87501 \nUSA \nii \nThese ideas underlie the terms of reference (TOR) for the study and was fully adopted \nby the Panel and the TAC Secretariat in the initial stages of their work. It provided the basis \nfor design of the extensive data collection and analysis undertaken by the Secretariat to \nquantify marginal biophysical characteristics, rural population and rural poor living on these \nareas, and CGIAR expenditures devoted to research on productivity increase (agriculture, \nforestry and fisheries), post-harvest activities and options for removal of institutional \nconstraints, all of which were expected to contribute to poverty alleviation on “marginal \nlands” as defined by their biophysical characteristics. \nThe Panel subsequently rejected the first three tenets, but in dlefining marginal \nagricultural lands (MALs) relevance and credibility are implicitly assigned to both the \nconcept that such lands can be defined solely by biophysical characteristics, and the project \ncharacteristics and expenditures (applied to MALs so defined) can be derived from the \nCGIAR project database. \nThe bottom line is the Panel’s conclusion that neither the gldbal and regional \nquantification of marginal land areas (based on biophysical data), nor the assessment of \nCGIAR projects and expenditures assignable to these various land areas, a.re relevant to the \nCGIAR’s decision on strategy for poverty alleviation. In the final report, the marginal land \nissue is clarified by introducing the concept of “marginal areas” (MA) as being those where \nthere are concentrations of marginal rural people and where the definition of geographic area \nwould derive from a set of relatively homogeneous variables deemed lto generate rural \npoverty. Biophysical characteristics would be one element in the equation,, \nThis definition of marginal lands led the Panel to diverge from the original TOR. It \nclearly did not have the data to quantify the numbers of rural poor on areas specified by the \nsets of elements which explain why they are marginal. Thus the conclusions, in contrast to \nthe expected output of the study, are general. No specific inferences are drawn on potential \npoverty alleviation gains from research investment on MAs to develop new technologies, \nunderstand farm and off-farm linkages in family survival strategies, and assess constraints \nand opportunities for change in the policy and institutional environment which may be seen \nas hindering poverty alleviation. Further, the Panel felt it was not in a position to assess the \nappropriate balance between CGIAR research investment targeted to MAs and to non-MAs. \nThis step would follow from a clarification of where marginal people are, why they are \nmarginal, and the options open to the System in addressing poverty in MAs. \nOn behalf of myself and the Panel I would like to express appreciation once again for \nthe opportunity to address a small but challenging segment of the issues faced by the CGIAR, \nand for the chance to work with the Secretariat and members of the Committee. \nSincerely yours, \nMichael Nelson \nPanel Chair \nCONSULTATIVE GROUP ON INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH \nTECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE \nREPORT OF THE \nSTUDY ON CGIAR RESEARCH PRIORITIES \nFOR MARGINAL LANDS \nChair: \nMembers: \nMichael Nelson \nRudy Dudal \nHans Gregersen \nNarpat Jodha \nDaniel Nyamai \nConsultants: Jan-Peter Groenewold \nFilemon Ton-es \nSecretary: Amir Kassam (TAC Secretariat) \nTAC SECRETARIAT \nFOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS \nMarch 1997 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ix \nCHAPTERl-BACKGROUND ................................. 1 \n1.1.

The final point in the terms of reference called for suggested priorities for research \non these lands and an assessment of the appropriate balance of effort between marginal \nand favoured lands (FL). As it delved into the issues, the Panel discovered there was: \nconsiderable confusion on definitions and concepts of marginality; a strong body of \nconventional wisdom on the relationship between poverty, marginal lands (ML) and \nresource degradation, the role of the CGIAR in poverty alleviation, and the potential of \nML to produce food; and an abysmal lack of data to validate this conventional wisdom. \nAs a consequence the study has focused exclusively on strategic questions bearing on how \nthe CGIAR might more systematically address poverty alleviation. In the process the \nPanel felt obliged to diverge from the initial hypothesis that research strategy would be \ndetermined primarily by the biophysical characteristics of ML. \nPerceptions Driving International Concern with ML \nThe concern of the Lucerne Declaration that the CGIAR ensure that its research \nprogrammes address the problems of the poor in less-endowed areas derives from widely \nheld views on the nature and scope of the issue. The axis is that research efforts by the \nSystem have done little for the poor on biophysically marginal .lands. * The view that most \nof the poor live in these fragile areas and are a cause and consequence of a downward \nspiral of resource degradation and deepening poverty, lends urgency to corrective action. \nDefinition of strategy with respect to overall allocation of resources within ML and \nbetween ML and FL would require: forecasts of the poor, and the rate of resource \ndegradation with associated yield decline and externalities; and an estimation of the \npotential poverty alleviation impact and the related environmental protection impact of \nresearch options applicable to both ML and FL. These premises and requirements were \ntaken as the point of departure for the study. \nDefinitions and Concepts \nMarginal lands: In order to provide a basis for mapping ML by biophysical \ncharacteristics, from which one could go on to determine numbers and incidence of rural \npoor and production potential for each area, the TAC Secretariat undertook an extensive \nanalysis of existing data leading to a six-quadrant matrix of three land types: FL, ML \nand lands in low or zero intensity use (LZI), each sub-divided into two areas - those with \na high expectation of a productivity response to research and those with a low expectation \nof response. The results from this exercise did not provide operationally relevant criteria \nfor CGIAR decisions. Accordingly, a second approximation was made whereby \nbiophysical characteristics establishing marginality were qualified by their current use in \nagriculture. This yielded estimates for favoured agricultural lands (FAL) - 800 million ha \n- and marginal agricultural lands (MAL) - 1,800 million ha. \nX \nLocution and incidence of rural poverty: From the above figures estimates were \nmade of rural population on the two land types - 930 million on FAL and 1,760 million \non MAL. No data are available for rural poor on each land type. However, from \nexamination of data on poverty incidence in countries with high and low :proportions of \nMAL and available case studies, there is no evidence that poverty incidence is higher on \nMAL than FAL. Applying available estimates of rural poverty incidence to rural \npopulation on these two land types results in 325 million poor on FAL (35 %) and 630 \nmillion (65 %) on MAL. \nRole of the CGIAR in MAL: A review of the project portfolio suggests that \nabout two-thirds of the System’s resources are invested in research relevant to MAL. \nBut there are no data on what may be targeted to poverty alleviation. The centres have \nhad many successes on marginal lands. If one accepts the above proportion of investment \nin MAL as well as the view of limited research impact on poverty, then a question of \ncost-effectiveness clearly arises. However, there is no evidence to support or refute the \nlatter view. It is nevertheless a key question which can only be addressed by progressive \naccumulation of information along the lines proposed in Recommendation 1 discussed \nbelow. \nPoverty and resource degradation: There is no evidence to support the view \nimplying that the poor are the prime cause of resource degradation on MAL. Again, \nclarification of this issue would derive from data assembled in response to \nRecommendation 1 and the study called for in the TAC Soil and Water Study to address \n“myths” on linkages between poverty, resource degradation and externalities. \nFrom Marginal Lands to Marginal People \nIn reviewing the data presented above on the location of poverty, poverty \nincidence and the allocation of CGIAR resources to MAL and FAL, the Panel came to \nthe conclusion that the inconsistencies and lack of data on the underlying site-specific \nforces driving the poverty process were such as to invalidate their usefuhress in guiding \nstrategy towards poverty alleviation on marginal lands. \nThe concept identified as relevant to evaluation of strategy was “marginal area” \n(MA), which is defined firstly by presence of high numbers and high incidence of \nmarginal people, and secondly is subject to a relatively homogeneous set of conditions \nwhich explain why they are poor - institutions, policy, infrastructure, human capital, \nbiophysical characteristics of land, etc. This definition of the “unit of account” for \nanalytical purposes poses two problems for the CGIAR: \nby redefining the issues in terms of MA which may incorporate any combination \nof ML and FL, poverty alleviation is being placed in a global context, thus \nmoving away from the original intent to deal only with poverty on ML \nMAs, by definition, will be site-specific and likely to be heterogeneous, and \nsubject to more internal diversity, complexity and institutional constraints than \nwould be expected for non-MAs. This is information-intensive and clearly \nxi \npresents a challenge in structuring research to provide international public goods. \nIt also establishes a context for poverty alleviation which goes beyond what the \nSystem is now doing or is likely to do. \nThe Panel is aware that over the past two years the CGIAR has fully adopted \npoverty alleviation as the objective of its research efforts and the MA approach proposed \nmay be regarded as merely a restatement of this commitment. Nevertheless, it is felt that \nworking through the ML/MAL/MA sequence has highlighted a number of dimensions \nwhich clarify strategic questions on approach - the data gaps (poverty/resource \ndegradation linkages, poverty processes), targeting marginal rural people and site-specific \ncharacteristics of MAs which condition the relevance of research. The Panel is convinced \nthat the System must come to grips with the site specificity and both the biophysical and \nnon-biophysical elements which explain poverty if it is to design research in expectation \nthat poverty impact can be evaluated. \nThe entry point to an evolving strategy derives from Recommendation 1: The \nCGIAR needs to sharpen its strategic focus on poverty alleviation, particularly in \nsetting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas. A prerequisite is \ndevelopment of a geo-referenced database linking biophysical land conditions with \npoverty and the processes that produce it (i.e. the dynamics of poverty). \nThe focus on poverty alleviation in marginal areas involves challenges in \nidentification, development and organization of research. Chief among these is the need \nto develop new forms of partnerships with NARS, NGOs, developed’ country institutions \nand multi and bilateral agencies. The CGIAR’s role will be restricted, albeit important. \nThe key to success is establishment of the right kinds of partnerships, hence: \nRecommendation 2: The centres should establish new forms of partnership in \norder to effectively address their roles in a broader poverty alleviation strategy \nrelated to those who live in marginal rural areas. \nSystem Research on MAs \nThe research thrust on poverty alleviation is seen to be in three inter-related areas: \nInstitutional and policy change: Work in this area has been covered by other \nTAC studies on social science, institutional, policy and management research. \nThe main focus is on analyses of: poverty processes; opportunities and constraints \nto institutional change; and viable options for improving welfare within existing \nconstraints. \nGenerating new and improved technologies: Technologies need to fit the \ninstitutional and socio-economic characteristics as well as biophysical conditions of \nMAs. \nDiversifying land use systems and income opportunities: Research will follow \nlines already established for natural resource management and clarification of \nxii \nlinkages between resource degradation and poverty. The focus would incorporate \ndiversification of production from renewable resources and off-farm income \nopportunities. \nTwo recommendations derive from the above research agenda: \nRecommendation 3: The CGIAR System should develop improved \nmechanisms by which centres can be involved with other partners in generating and \ninterpreting improved scientific evidence on (i) the extent and magnitude of the \nimpacts of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on the degradation or enhancement of \nnatural resources and the consequences for production and food security; and (ii) the \nlinkage between poverty and observed resource degradation. \nRecommendation 4: Expanded collaborative mechanisms and activities should \nbe developed among centres and between centres and their non-CGIAR partners, to \nhelp focus research and institutional strengthening on issues related to adoption, \nadaptation and utilization of research results that so far have remained unused. \nImplications of a Broader Research Focus \nThe Panel recognized that it is recommending a broadening of the research focus \nto include non-traditional (for the CGIAR) types of research related to off-farm \nemployment, postharvest technology, niche opportunities, and forestry, agroforestry and \nfisheries. Such expansion implies a possible readjustment in use of existing resources. On \nthe question of whether there should be an increase in resources, the Panel is fully aware \nof the constraints. In this era of donor fatigue and contraction of funds for both national \nand international R&D for agriculture, any expansion may seem unrealistic. The nature of \nresearch to target poverty alleviation on MAs dictates the forging of new linkages \nbetween the CGIAR and other actors. High transaction costs are inevitable. However, \nthere is an urgent need for an expanded innovative research effort to address poverty \nalleviation for those who live on MAs. These marginal people have been disregarded in \nthe past. There appears to be a unique opportunity for the CGIAR to contribute towards \ncorrecting this neglect. \nCHAPTER 1 - BACKGROUND \nThis study of research priorities for marginal lands comes as a sequel to the TAC \nstudy ‘Priorities and Strategies for Soil and Water Aspects of Natural Resource \nManagement in the CGIAR.“. That report highlighted the importance of “strengthening \nnatural resource management (NRM) [with] explicit linking to . . . the CGIAR contribution \nto poverty alleviation.” In its review of the TAC report at the Mid-Term Meeting (May \n1996), members of the CGIAR concluded that there should be a much greater sense of \nurgency given to soil and water research due to the centrality of the environmental issue. \nThe focus on poverty alleviation in marginal rural areas does not imply that the \nSystem is uninterested in the poor who live on the prime lands or in urban areas. It merely \nreflects a conviction that the CGIAR has an opportunity not readily available to other \nsuppliers of research, and an obligation to address a rural poverty group which has been left \nbehind \nIn moving ahead to articulate a strategy for achieving the overarching goal of \nsustainable poverty alleviation and associated food security, the next step specifically with \nrespect to rural poverty is identification of where these people live and their present \nnumbers. From this information base, one may move to characterize the current status of \nthe lands from which they derive part or all of their livelihoods. From the optic of \ntechnology to increase productivity of resources used in agriculture, this status may be \ninitially expressed in terms of biophysical potential, i.e. biophysically favoured versus \nmarginal lands. However, the determinants of poverty (marginal people) lie mainly with \nthe socio-economic and institutional aspects (markets, policies, physical infrastructure, \nhuman capital) which govern the choice sets of the population in using natural resources \nto which they have access and in obtaining off-farm income. \nWith specification of the biophysical, institutional, policy and socio- economic \ncharacteristics which explain why the various target groups are poor, one is in a position \nto explore research options whose output and outcomes may be expected to have an impact \non sustainable poverty alleviation. From that point one can go on to examine what the \nCGIAR might do, i.e. the entry points where there is expectation of significant impact from \nresearch through output of international public goods. \nThe decision to start the process of assessing possible avenues for change in \ndirection with an examination of research options for marginal lands derive from a \nperception that marginal populations - the rural poor - are likely to be concentrated in these \nareas, and further, that the incidence of extreme poverty will be higher than on favoured \nlands. These areas are seen to be fragile and occupying the major part of lands already \nsettled or in process of expansion (clearing of tropical forest). Accordingly there is a \nconcern with the prospect of large-scale resource degradation and attendant externalities. \nIn addition, there is a presumption that CGIAR research has had little impact on the poor \nin these areas except by indirection, i.e. by providing employment on favoured lands which \nhave benefited from research, or by lower food prices to those who purchase part of their \nneeds. \n2 \nAll land types - marginal or favoured - need research related to environmental \nprotection and sustainable productivity which can to a greater or lesser extent help in the \nquest for poverty alleviation and expanded food security for the poor. On the favoured \nlands, expanded production can result in lower prices for urban consumers, as well as to \nincreased jobs and food for the rural poor in both areas. To the extent that the poor live \non the marginal lands, research that leads to productivity increases on those lands also can \nhelp to alleviate poverty and increase food security. Thus, in and of themselves, the twin \nobjectives of poverty alleviation and environmental protection do not provide useful \nguidance in terms of allocation of research resource between marginal anId favoured lands. \nThus, while “marginal lands” still provide a reference point, the Panel concluded that \nthe study should focus on research issues and strategies related to marginalized people - \nthose whose poverty and food insecurity may be caused by not only their association with \nbiophysically low productivity or impoverished (marginal) lands, but also with, for example, \nlack of access to inputs, or lack of access to markets (effective dlemand for their \nproduction), off-farm means for earning income and related institutional constraints. \nIn its terms of reference (Annex I) TAC made it clear that the System should not \nbe investing in research on marginal lands just because they are currently considered low \npotential areas for agriculture, and it “favours allocating resources such that the balance \nbetween high and low potential environments emerges from the concern with poverty \nalleviation and resource conservation, rather than being introduced a priori.” \n1.1. The Change in Focus Between Phase I and Phase II \nPhase I of this Study started from the premise that poverty alleviation is the primary \ngaol of the CGIAR and that the means by which the System would have an impact is \nthrough sustainable productivity enhancement embodied within natural resource \nmanagement. In order to address the issues of research priorities, it was, assumed: \nmarginal lands are a definable research target (areas, population, beneficiaries, and \nexternalities); \nresearch requirements are qualitatively different from favoured lands; \nstrategic or tactical questions will be conditioned by trade-offs among poverty \nalleviation, food production and environmental protection. \nAs a result of exchange of views with TAC, the centres and flier discussion \nwithin the Panel, the following modifications have been introduced. \nThe concept of multiple objectives and the inherent trade-offs associated with \npoverty alleviation, food production and natural resource management is modified. \nPoverty alleviation is accepted as the single strategic objective. Environmental \nprotection may also be an objective, but not for the CGIAR in situa.tions where there \nmay be trade-offs with poverty alleviation. Rather, productivity enhancement within \n3 \nthe context of natural resource management (NRM) or environmental management \nis seen as the means to poverty alleviation. Further, food security is seen as a \nquestion of income. Thus, in the case of rural poverty alleviation on marginal lands, \nproductivity applies to food and non-food activities derived from the renewable \nresources to which the poor have access, and off-farm income opportunities. \nIt is recognized more explicitly that marginal lands constitute a moving target. \nThere are drawbacks to defining them in terms of biophysical and economic yields \nsince both their physical and economic yields can be altered by on-site investments \nand exogenous institutional factors affecting markets, prices, resource entitlements, \netc. Further, due to spatial variability, farmers may have access to both marginal \nand favoured lands which could clearly modify their management systems. Thus, \nsoil and climatic domains, although relevant, in most cases are likely to be \noutweighed by qualifying variables in determining the research approach. \nThe point of departure is marginal poor not marginal lands. The implication is a \nmore explicit focus on the human capital, physical capital and institutional \nconstraints faced by these people, as well as the biophysical constraints of their \nnatural capital. All constraints are considered candidates for research, including \nintegrated approaches to target the rural poor in definable geographic areas. In \nmapping marginal rural populations for the purpose of defining research options and \ndecision on priorities, criteria for establishing the boundaries will be weighted to the \nnon-biophysical rather than the biophysical determinants of poverty. \n1.2. Presentation of the Analysis \nThe terms of reference for the study carry a strong inference that marginal lands \n(ML) are biophysically defined. The corollary is that with a scientifically solid definition \none can map these areas together with existing and forecasted numbers of rural poor in \neach. From there, the primary point of entry for the CGIAR would be research to \novercome the biophysical constraints, in association with socio-economic, policy and \ninstitutional research which would facilitate the diffusion and application of technology in \non-farm and off-farm activities affecting the welfare of the poor. Given this framework, \nChapter 2 deals first with the statistical implications of the biophysical definition of ML; \nsecond, with the derivation of marginal agricultural lands (MALs) as a more operational \nconcept enabling plausible estimates of rural poor located on these lands and the resources \nallocated by the CGIAR to such areas; and third, with the move away from biophysical \ncriteria (as the prime criterion for determining marginality) to a more comprehensive \ndefinition of “marginal areas” (MA), based on concentration of marginal rural people and \nwhy they are marginal, as the operationally relevant concept for decisions by the CGIAR. \nChapter 3 examines the options open to the CGIAR in addressing poverty in MAs. \nChapters 4, 5 and 6 assess research requirements bearing on removal of constraints on \nknowledge, resources and incentives to poverty alleviation in the areas of: \nchange in institutions and policy \ngeneration and diffusion of improved technologies \ndiversification of land use and income sources. \n4 \nCHAPTER 2 - DEFINITIONS AND CONTEX:T \nIn responding to the Phase I report of this study, most of the centres8 raised questions \non: the interpretation of “marginal lands”; the advisability of using very coarse-g-rained \nindicators of biophysical capability of land as one basis for programming the System’s \nactivities; the credibility of estimates relating to rural population and land types; and, what \nis meant by poverty alleviation With respect to its links to research delivered by the CGIAR. \n2.1. Marginal Lands \nMany different names are used to designate lands in terms of their production \ncapacity - favoured, fertile, marginal, low potential, resource poor, high potential, fragile, \nvulnerable or degraded. Terms which relate to “marginal” areas are frequently used \ninterchangeably and often without definition. The difficulty in formulating a clear \ndefinition stems from the fact that “productivity” varies according to the type of land use. \nA tract of land that is “marginal” for crop production may be well su:ited for grazing. \n“Fragile” lands may be sensitive to degradation under cultivation but may be sustainably \nused for forestry. Further more, productivity is not only based on the biophysical \ncharacteristics of land, but also depends on the socio-economic paramet,ers of a specific \nenvironment. Technologies may be known but the necessary incentives, institutions or \ninputs may be missing. Farmers are generally aware of the physical. benefits of improved \nseeds and of mineral fertilizers, but may not have access to inputs or be unwilling to accept \nthe climatic and price risks. The range of possible uses of land is so wide and socio- \neconomic conditions are so diverse that no definition can encompass all the relevant factors. \nHowever, in order to ensure a common understanding, the general terms used in this study \nare briefly described below. \nAttention is drawn here to the concept of “land” which is broader than just soil or \nterrain. Although soil is an important and relatively stable element of land it is only one \ncomponent. Land is an area of the earth’s surface which comprises the major biophysical \nattributes which influence its use. These include the atmosphere, soil, geology, hydrology, \nplant and animal populations, and the results of past and present human activity such as \nterracing, drainage or irrigation. The evaluation of land does not only refer to its productive \npotential, but also to the sustainability of its use, that is the maintenance or enhancement \nof its productivity over the long term, while at the same time conserving its potential as a \nresource base. \nTable 2.1 lists the four terms - favoured, marginal, fragile and degraded land - which \nare commonly used in this study. It should be noted that the constraints of a biophysical \nand socio-economic nature may apply separately or simultaneously. Marginality can be the \nresult of different combinations of constraints. For instance, biophysically “good” land can \nbe marginal on account of its isolation from markets, the unavailability of inputs, or the \nsmall size of holdings. The nature, composition and interaction of the factors which \ndetermine land marginality differ widely. \n5 \nTable 2.1: Proposed Definitions of Land Types \n. \nDefinition \nFavoured land: \nBiophysical Constraints Socio-Economic Constraints \nLand having no, or moderate \nlimitations to sustained application \nunder a given use.

Some \nsoils are vulnerable to nutrient depletion, but are sufficiently resilient for soil fertility to be \nrestored through good management. \n6 \n2.2 Initial Framework for Evaluating the Issues \nThe nature and extent of the challenge faced by the CGIAR in addressing poverty \nalleviation on marginal lands may be illustrated from Table 2.2. Three broad land types are \nidentified: \n(0 favoured lands with high present agricultural use values (HPUV), \n(ii) marginal lands with low present agricultural use values (LPUV) and \n(iii) lands at low or zero intensity of agricultural use (LZI). \nFor each land type one may speculate that there are those with a high potential for expansion \nof production based on research (HPEPR) and those with a low potential for expansion of \nproduction based on research (LPEPR). Thus; there is a six-quadrant matrix which may be \naddressed by research. It is generally held that research undertaken to date, focused on land \ntypes in quadrant I and quadrant II, has largely benefited quadrant II, particularly the wheat \nand irrigated rice lands. As it stands this table is an approximation of potential to expand \nagricultural production through research. It does not reflect options for research on forest \nsystems, coastal fisheries related to terrestrial systems or the dynamics of movement of land \ntypes among the quadrants (see Annex II). \nIn their response to the Phase I report, most of the centres commented on the \ncriteria used in establishing area estimates for each quadrant, and approximating rural \npopulation and rural poor associated with each. In addition, a concept w(as introduced for \nmarginal lands which identified those areas where both the numbers and proportion of rural \npoor were low, in contrast to what might be considered “poverty dense” areas. In general, \nthe centres do no design their programming to address soil/climatic domains or rural \npopulations classified by geographic area. Rather they tend to target problem areas or \nspecific land use regimes. In spite of the difficulties in defining terms used to characterize \nthe biophysical productivity of lands and in estimating “poverty density”, the Panel \nconsidered the six-quadrant approach to be a useful concept in sorting out the issues and \npriorities in allocating research resources between high productivity areas and marginal lands \nassociated with persistent poverty. It is a particularly appropriate framework in light of the \nfollowing widely held views which characterize thinking on rural poverty and the role of the \nCGIAR: \nML are defined in biophysical terms which establish them as: having low inherent \nproductivity for agriculture; fragile and therefore susceptible to degradation \nbecause of slope and/or climate; and subject to high agricultural r:isk due to climate \nand disease; \nML support a high proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the \npoor; \nthe combination of fragility and high density of poor people who place a premium \non current consumption (resulting in over-exploitation of natural resources) is \nleading to accelerated erosion and vegetation destruction; the consequence is a \ndownward poverty spiral with significant negative externalities because of the large \nareas classified as ML relative to those considered favoured; \nthe impact of CGIAR research on poverty alleviation and related productivity \nincrease and environmental protection in ML has been low. \n. \nTable 2.2: Present Use Value (PUV) of Lands and Potential to Expand Production Based \non Research (PEPR) \n:. :. ‘.’ \n8 \n2.3. Marginal Lands as a Moving Target \n*It is recognized that lands do not neatly define themselves in the above quadrants \nand that their classification is not definite. In practice, there is a continuum among the \nquadrants with changes in economic conditions, improvement of infrastructures, innovative \nresearch, fluctuations in population pressure. For example, the existence of a continuum is \nparticularly common between quadrant V (forest), quadrant III, and quadrant I. Defining the \nLZI type is a hazardous exercise where one is moving from the extensive desert margins in \nquadrant VI to potential opportunities for intensification of forestry in quadrant V. In \naddition, the definition of lands which are responsive or unresponsive to research (in \nproduction terms) is a static concept. In practice, research innovation should enable LPUV \nlands in quadrants III and IV to be transferred to HPEPR lands in quadrant I and LPEPR \nlands in quadrant II. \nAny number of factors may lead to shifts of land from one category to another. \nThese shifts may be upward, through applications of improved techniques, or downward as \na result of land degradation or inappropriate development of lands formerly at low use levels. \nHence, marginality is not a static concept. \nWhen dealing with issues of natural resources management, it is essential that these \nspatial and temporal dimensions be taken into account. Therefore, “marginality” has to be \nassessed in terms of specific types of land use. Land that is marginal for a crop requiring \na long growing period could be highly productive for more drought tolerant, short-season \ncrops. What is marginal land for cropping may be very suitable for livestock production. \nThe severity of soil constraints may vary with the climatic conditions under which they \noccur. For instance, under low rainfall, lighter soils may be more productive than heavier \nsoils on account of easier tillage and more rapid uptake of available water. Shifts between \nquadrants may also result from management practices. Infertile soils which are marginal can \nbecome highly productive through judicious application of organic and mineral inputs. \nA key characteristic of marginal, as distinct from favoured lands is the location \nspecificity of terrain, climate, soils and socio-economic conditions. Many technologies to \nremedy biophysical marginality are well-known. The dynamic dimension is critical - marked \nshifts of land quality will result from the use of resources with the necessary incentives to \napply results of research, i.e., overcoming the policy and institutional constraints. \nIn summing up, the Panel found that the definition of “marginal” depends on so \nmany qualifiers that it becomes meaningless in an operational sense. This is illustrated by \nthe fact that land can be “marginal” depending on: \nt its use (what is marginal~agricultural land may be highly productive forest land); \nt its natural biophysical characteristics (which can be altered by investment); \nits location relative to infrastructure such as roads, railroads, harbors, and cities (a road into a \nregion can completely alter the economic returns from land near the road); \nt the institutional and policy context which influences access of inhabitzmts to land, water, \ncredit, markets, outside inputs (development of market access can completely alter the economics \nof land use): \npopulation pressure (e.g., size of land holdings; from a cattle rancher’s perspective, his or her \nlarge area of land is not “marginal”, even though the biophysical yield per ha is low; at the same \n9 \ntime, a farmer with only one ha. in the midst of the most favoured agricultural area may feel that \nhe or she is on “marginal land”); \ntechnology development (Jojoba development in arid environments; acid tolerant rice in the \nCerrados of Brazil); \nb taking advantage of niche opportunities (spices, flowers, vegetables, special fibres) \nLands move out of and into marginal status depending on which of the above \ndimensions are applied in the definition. It only makes sense to define %arginal land” in \nterms of a clearly defined, specijic situation. \n2.4. Contexts in which the Term “Marginal Lands” is Used \nBecause of the wide variety of ways in which “marginal” lands can be defined, \nthe term is used to mean quite different things, depending on the context. In fact, the Panel \nreached the conclusion that the concept, in a biophysical sense alone, is not adequate to \nidentify operational responses by the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors to poverty \nalleviation - the fundamental goal of the CGIAR. \nThe Panel identified three common threads that run through the documentation \non “marginal lands, ” broadly defined. They are: \nb A concern with poverty - under the assumption that most of the rural poor live on \n“marginal” lands; thus a concern for “marginal” lands is a proxy for concern with \npoverty alleviation for those who happen to live on the myriad forms of less \nfavoured areas of the world; and a further concern for the fact that the CGIAR \nmay somehow have missed these poor people, because it has not targeted poverty \nin the “marginal” lands areas. (This concern dominates in the development \nliterature) \nA concern with vulnerable and fragile lands and the problems of irreversible \ndestruction or degradation of sensitive natural areas - the problems of \ndesertification; deterioration of mountain environments; the destruction of other \nnatural environments such as mangroves and natural forests, and pollution and \ndestruction of biodiversity in coastal zones. (This concern dominates in the \nenvironmental literature) \nb A concern that the more favoured rainfed lands, the irrigated lands, and some of \nthe “rice” and “wheat” baskets of the world, as well as highly productive \nbottomlands and hillsides, were being “marginalized” through overuse or misuse. \n(This concern shows up in the agricultural development literature, as well as in the \nenvironmental literature) \nThe Panel further noted that, even within each of the interpretations of why \n“marginal lands” are important, there is uncertainty over what the term means, how lands \ncan be classified as “marginal”, and how they can move out of marginal status into \nproductive lands contributing to sustainable development. \n10 \n2.5. From Biophysically Marginal Lands (ML) to Marginal \nAgricultural Land (MAL) Based on Existing Use \nIn light of the above reasoning, the Panel came to the conclusion that, although the \nsoil/climatic domains specified in Table 2.2 provide a scientifically coherent basis for \nidentifying land capability with respect to its agricultural potential and its expected \nproductivity response to agricultural research, it was not an operationally relevant concept. \nWhile retaining the biophysical criterion for classification, it was considered that a better \napproximation of the marginal land issues faced by the CGIAR would be provided by \nqualifying biophysical characteristics of lands according to their current use in agriculture \n(See Table 2.3). This enabled a specification of a scientifically defensible area of favoured \nagricultural lands (FAL) . Thus, they excluded forest and woodland areas with high \nagricultural potential. FALs were considered to be in rainfed and irrigated agriculture (800 \nmillion ha) in areas which are fertile (with or without chemical subsidies), well-drained, with \neven topography and (if unirrigated) with adequate rainfall. They are in comparatively \nintensive use, and generally within their use-capability. They are at risk of degradation if \nmismanaged but risk of externalities from mismanagement is low, as is vulnerability to \nirreversible damage. \nMarginal agricultural lands (MAL) were identified as those areas which are \ncurrently used for agriculture, grazing or agroforestry (1.8 billion ha). Such areas typically \nencompass mountains and tropical and sub-tropical lowlands or plateaux with low, unstable \nrainfall or higher rainfall areas in intensive use relative to use-capability under existing \npopulation densities, traditional technologies and institutional structures. In most cases, in \nabsence of external inputs, they have reached or exceeded the threshold limits to maintenance \nor enhancement of agricultural performance. They are characterized by: poor soil fertility \n(nutrient deficiencies, acidity, salinity, poor moisture holding capacity, etc. ) , inaccessibility \n(poor communications, immobility with all its social and economic implications); fragility \n(low input absorptive capacity, high input-output ratios, limited capacity to withstand \ndisturbance, vulnerable to irreversible damage); and heterogeneity (physically and culturally \ndiverse with site-specific constraints and opportunities which restrict applicability of general \ntechnological or institutional measures to remove constraints or exploit opportunities). Aside \nfrom the above inherent characteristics, marginal low-productivity lands may also result from \ndegradation of non-marginal lands or inappropriate development of lands formerly at low or \nzero use levels. All areas are at risk of further degradation with high expectation of negative \nexternalities. \nThe quadrants V and VI were redefined in Table 2.3 such that quadrant V was \nconsidered forested area regardless of its agricultural potential and quadrant ‘VI was classified \nas arid with very limited rural population regardless of its irrigation potential. Because of \nthe dynamics of movement among quadrants, both of these - particularly quadrant V - are \nrelevant to rural poverty alleviation for the current and future generations in marginal areas. \n2.6. Location and Incidence of Rural Poverty on MAL \nA second modification in the conceptual ML approach centred on the location of \nrural poverty.

The \ndistribution is 35 % (930 million on FALs) and 65 % (1,760 million) on other lands (MAL, \nforest and arid lands). \nThe question then arises as to whether there is a greater incidence of rural poverty \non MALs than FALs. National figures available for rural poor, as a percent of total rural \npopulation, were compared with the percent of rural population on MALs to assess whether \ncountries with a high proportion of population on MAL also showed high incidence of rural \npoverty. No correlation was found. This conclusion also is suggested by the work of Kelley \nand Rao in India3. An IFPRI study, also in India, suggests that both the absolute numbers \nand incidence of rural poverty are greater on FAL than MAL4. Accordingly, rural poverty \nin the two areas was approximated by applying national percentages - the result 325 million \npoor on FAL and 630 million on MAL’. \nSimilarly, in forecasting poverty on MAL, the only proxy for future numbers in \nthe latter area would have to be derived from projections of overall rural poverty. Using \ntrend estimates for the 1990-2000 period, one might speculate that, unless a major effort \nis made, numbers are unlikely to decline significantly at a global level in the near future. \nHowever, at the regional level, in sub-Saharan Africa the situation is likely to deteriorate \nsuch that its share of the world’s rural poor may increase from about 30% to 45% by early \nnext century. Asia would continue to have the highest absolute number of rural poor, but \nits world share may drop from around 60% to 50%6. \nIntroduction of the degradation and productivity dimensions to the poverty- \nmarginal land linkages requires a focus on the dynamics of movement, from favoured \nagricultural lands downward to ML and the reverse through upgrading. It also requires \nconsidering the possibilities for: expanding the stock of favoured agricultural lands by \ntransformation from the 2.9 billion ha of forests and development of irrigation on a small \nfraction of the 2 billion ha in arid land; or, expanding the stock of marginal lands, assumed \nto be driven largely by rural poverty, at the expense of forest lands. These dimensions are \ndiscussed below with respect to rural poverty alleviation (in MALs) linked to FALs. \n2.7. Linkage of FAL to Poverty on MAL \nThere are three reasons for considering favoured agricultural lands (FALs) in a \nstudy of poverty alleviation on marginal lands: \nThrough degradation they can shift into the low productivity category (marginal) \nof either rainfed or irrigated lands. As pointed out in comments by several of the \n6 \nKelley, T.C. and P.P. Rao. 1995. “Marginal Environments and the Poor: Evidence from \nIndia”. Economic and Political Weekly. Vol. xxx. No.40. \nFan, S. and P.B.R. Hazell. 1996. “Should the India Government Invest More in Less \nFavoured Areas? “. IFPRI, Washington D.C. \nThis figure contrasts with an estimate made in the mid 1980s - 370,000 poorest of the poor \n(using the criterion of the poorest 20% for each country) on low potential lands, in: Leonard, \nH.H.

Washington, D.C. \n14 \ncentres on the Phase I report of the study, the clearest example is salinization of \nirrigated lands. The impact of this process is increasing poverty on an increasing \nstock of marginal lands. \nThrough further productivity increase, particularly in quadrant I, they should \nprovide employment opportunities for rural poor who would otherwise contribute \nto pressure (degradation) on MALs or to accelerated conversion of forest to \nMALS. \nSimilarly, the processes of reduction of pressure on natural resoiurces as a means \nto poverty alleviation would also apply to employment opportunities generated in \nvalue-added or off-farm activities in FALs. \nIn addition to the role of favoured lands in poverty alleviation ,for present and \nfuture rural populations in marginal areas, there is also the question of research directed to \nthe poor on favoured lands themselves. This is a fundamental strategic question for the \nCGIAR in terms of the balance among research investments which address a range of rural \npopulation target groups from a poverty alleviation perspective. There is also a major \nquestion of yield maintenance research in FALs. There is a continuum from investments \ndesigned to: rehabilitate the productive capacity of the resource, i.e. reverse the degradation \nprocess; conserve the “state” of resources, and implicitly their yield capacity; and enhance \nyields. The first two are land improving investments, the third is “technological change”7. \nIt is evident that priority of research related to poverty alleviation in all areas \n(favoured and marginal) through’ changes in the cultivated area, employment and income \ngenerated on FALs by reducing shifts to lower productivity, investment in productivity \nincrease, human capital, physical infrastructure and institutional change, ishould be judged \nby the cost-effectiveness of research expected to have poverty alleviation impacts for the \nvarious target groups. The Panel is aware that we are a long way from specification of \nthese target groups. Nevertheless, the linkages and dynamics of movement among classes \nof land and changes in the numbers and location of the rural poor, dictate that any’ strategy \nof rural poverty alleviation on marginal lands take into account the social cost-effectiveness \nof research on favoured lands, and should incorporate the spillovers to other areas. The \nframework for cost-effectiveness. analysis is discussed in Annex III. \nWit8 _ ” \nThe dilemma of research on MALs vis-a-vis FALs has been characterised by de \nwell endowed regions are able to meet demands at relatively low prices . . . this \nmarginalizes less endowed regions because their terms of trade are eroding. Scarcity of \nfunds, and the lack of political power of (these) regions makes it unlikely that the transfer \nof money that would be needed to revert such marginalization processes will occur in the \nforeseeable future.. . . . Agricultural research which is oriented to improvement of least \nendowed regions may open up new possibilities in some situations. However, in many \ncases its results are more readily applied in regions that are better off.“’ Accepting this \npremise, a ‘key issue for the CGIAR is the weighting of poverty in the formula discussed \nin Annex III. . \n7 \n8 \nScherr, S.J. and S.Yadav. 1996. “Land Degradation in the Developing World: Implications \nfor Food, Agriculture, and the Environment to 2020”.

Jones \n(ed.) “System Theory Applied to Agriculture and the Food Chain “, Elsevier. \n15 \n2.8. Current CGIAR Activity in Poverty Alleviation on MAL \nBased on the foregoing definitions of MAL and FAL, the CGIAR invests about \none-third of its resources in the favourable agricultural lands of quadrants I and II (FALs), \nand the remaining two-thirds on the marginal agricultural lands of quadrants III and IV (see \nAnnex IV). Considering, however, that targeted MALs include productive areas such as \nthe cracking “black cotton” soils of India and western Africa, the poorly drained “inland \nvalleys” of West Africa and the infertile “Cerrados” of Brazil, it would also seem \nappropriate to draw the conclusion that three quarters of CGIAR resources are being applied \nto increase the sustainable productivity of lands with high agro-ecological potential. \nIn terms of the three primary thrusts of research (see section 3.4), estimates of \nresource allocation indicate that around 30% support activities aimed at generating \nimproved biological opportunities, close to 50% go to the intensification and diversification \nof production systems, and the remaining 20% to policies and institutional issues. \nCurrent activity categories, however, are not sensitive enough to indicate actual \nresources allocated to alleviating constraints for the marginal poor. An assessment of \nobjectives, outputs and beneficiaries of the 374 projects endorsed for 1997 showed that 25% \nare fully targeted at poverty alleviation on MALs and 7% in FALs (Annex IV). \n2.9. From Marginal Lands to Marginal Population \nIn reviewing the figures presented in Sections 2.6 and 2.8 derived from a \nbiophysical definition of MAL and FAL, the Panel came to the conclusion that the \ninconsistencies and lack of data on the underlying site-specific forces driving the rural \npoverty process were such as to invalidate their usefulness in guiding CGIAR strategy \ntowards poverty alleviation on marginal lands. \nOn the surface, the existence of two-thirds of the rural poor on MAL would fully \njustify the CGIAR’s concern with poverty on these lands. This is further reinforced if one \naccepts an underlying hypothesis of the Lucerne Declaration, that Green Revolution \ntechniques have had limited impact on productivity for poverty alleviation in MALs, so \ndefined. However, on further reflection the Panel concluded there was no evidence to \nsupport this hypothesis. There are areas where CGIAR research has not contributed to rural \npoverty alleviation but they are not confined to MAL. In addition, there are MALs which \nhave shown significant response to research by the System in terms of productivity and, by \ninference, poverty alleviation. MAL is simply not a good proxy for where the poor people \nlive or where the CGIAR has had little impact. Under these circumstances it was decided \nto discard biophysical productivity of lands, whether in the pure sense of world soils and \nclimate, i.e. ML, or in the restricted sense of those areas currently in agricultural use, i.e. \nMAL, as the point of entry for assessing CGIAR strategy with respect to rural poverty \nalleviation. \n16 \nThe Panel had considerable difficulty in finding a substitute term for ML or MAL \nwhich respected an interpretation of the intent of the terms of reference to be that the study \naddress strategic issues in research aimed at poverty alleviation on lands which were \nintuitively considered as biophysically marginal and which clearly were believed to support \nhigh concentrations of rural poor who had not benefited from Green Revolution research \ne.g. the Himalaya, Andes, desert margins of WANA or tropical forest margins. In fact, the \nPanel believes that the above interpretation of the intent has been respected. For want of \nanything better the term adopted as the ‘unit” for evaluation of strategy was “marginal \narea” (MA), i.e. one with a high incidence of rural poor subject to a relatively homogeneous \nset of conditions which determine why they are poor (see section 2.10). This obviously \nincludes biophysical conditions. \nIn spite of the fact that MA may be applied to any combination of biophysically \nmarginal or favoured land, the Panel elected to use this term in Chapters 3 to 6 in \nexamining options open to the CGIAR to address rural poverty through change in: policies \nand institutions; new and improved technologies and diversification of land use and income \nsources in MAs. \n2.10. Poverty Processes on Marginal Areas \nThe Panel considered the forces driving the processes which retain people in \npoverty on MAs, in terms of the inter-relationships between the resources and knowledge \navailable to these people and their incentive to use them for sustainable enhancement of \nlivelihoods. This relates to the question of constraints to access of the poor to knowledge, \nnatural resources, markets and off-farm income opportunities (including the options to \nmigrate). Constraints are generally regarded as rooted in institutions and policies. \nMarginal areas, because of characteristics such as their isolation, perceived low \nand risky productive potential, and the insignificant economic and associated political power \nof their inhabitants, typically have been neglected by central governments. As a result, only \nlimited public investment has been made in education, health, infrastructure, etc. Little \ninterest has been shown in determining the aspirations of marginal people or their \nknowledge of how to cope with harsh environments as a basis for focusing public action \nresponsive to their capabilities and needs. In view of the high costs of providing quality \nservices to such areas, it has been argued that accelerated development im other sectors - \nnon-marginal rural areas, industry, services - would be sufficient to attract migration on a \nscale which would increase the resource base (and income) per capita for the residual \npopulation. \nThe “trickle down” theory of development and poverty alleviation in most \nmarginal areas has not worked. Populations in many are increasing in albsolute numbers \nin spite of migration, and increase is likely to continue, probably at a decreasing rate, for \nsome decades. Without investment in the “resource base” of these people, with expanding \npopulations the expectation can only be progressive extension of poverty and degradation \nof the soils and forests on which they depend for a large part of their sustenance. \n17 \n. In agriculture, inappropriate research has been blamed for not taking into account \nindigenous luiowledge and the opportunities and constraints which apply to the site-specific \ncharacteristics of MAs. Thus, it is asserted that few research results have led to widespread \nor significant improvement in the welfare of marginal people. This is undoubtedly true in \nmany instances but is merely one symptom of the underlying cause of marginality, i.e. the \ninstitutional and policy arrangements. Without any negotiating leverage by marginal \ncommunities on the decision.makers responsible for the amount and type of investment in \nMAs, these investments tend to be small and poorly adapted to the requirements of the \npeople. This applies equally to agricultural research and extension investments (and other \nareas such as education, health or infrastructure) which have been unable to respond to \ncomplex diverse requirements for sustainable exploitation of opportunities deriving from \nnatural resources and value adding micro-enterprises. \nHowever, the problem is not technology as such. Rather, it is the institutional \narrangements which determine: what and how agricultural research and extension is carried \nout, together with the whole range of support services (credit, roads, communications, \nschools, etc.); resource entitlements; the functioning of markets; and local capacity to \nmanage their own affairs’. A matter of concern is the breakdown of common property \nsystems in some areas where they comprise an important part of the risk-sharing and \nsurvival strategies of poor farmers and herders on lands with highly variable rainfall (see \nBox 1). \nIt is evident that the institutions and policies which drive the poverty process are \ncountry-specific. Nevertheless, the CGIAR appears to have a role to play, albeit small, in \nhelping to introduce poverty alleviation strategies for the poor living in MAs. Among the \nprincipal avenues open to the CGIAR are those already outlined in the TAC report on \npolicy and management research lo. \n2.11. Implications: Recommendations for the CGIAR \nThe Panel is fully aware that by discarding the biophysical criteria for defining \nML or MAL, it is violating the spirit of the terms of reference. By redefining the issues \nin terms of MAs which may occur on any combination of FAL and MAL, the issue of \npoverty alleviation is being placed in a global context, rather than being confmed to \nmarginal lands and the rural poor who derive a large part of their livelihoods from them, \nand who a priori are believed to have been by-passed by the Green Revolution. \nNevertheless, it is sustained ‘that this is merely another way of cutting the pie. The key \nquestion is still where are the concentrations of poor who have been by-passed by \nCGIAR research. The criterion for distinguishing the by-passed from the non-by-passed \n9 \n10 \nJodha,’ N.S. 1995. ‘Enhancing Food Security in a Warmer and More Crowded World: Factors \nand Process in Fragile Areas’.

Rome. \n18 \nrural poor is different. It carries the implications that conditions for maqginality of people \nalso exist on FALs as is implied in Table 2.1, e.g. landless and land poor (farm size issues). \n19 \nBox 1: Common Property Resources and Marginal Lands \nRural common property resources (CPR) described simply are \ncommunity resources where every member of the community has access and \nreciprocal obligation to help in their regulated use, without any exclusive \nprivate right to claim and saIe any part of the resources. In the developing \ncountries they include community grazing lands, forests, watering ‘points, \nwatersheds and (in a de facto sense) most of the public lands not assigned by \nthe state for private use or public reserves. Much of these latter areas may \nbe considered de facto “open access”, i.e., there is no management by a \ncommunity, individual or the state. \nCPRs play an important roIe in: consumption by the rural poor as \na source of supplies (e.g., fuel, fodder and food); incomes through collection \nas well as processing and sale of wild products - especially during the seasons \nand years when crop incomes are not available; and enhancing nutrient \navailability to draft animals needed for crop farming. \nIn some areas rural poor derive as much as 30 percent of their \nconsumption from CPRs. Moreover, in villages with productive CPRs, they \nprovidezrop income as well. Thus, CPR-PPR (private property resource) \nbased activities have significant complementarity. However, in most \ncountries due to institutional, policy and demographic changes, CPRs are \nunder severe stress. Area has declined due to legal or illegal privatisation \nand with weakening of the culture of group action productivity has \ndeteriorated. ln practice, CPRs have become open access. This’ suggests \nresearch aimed at rehabilitation of CPRs with two inter-related components: \n(i) technology oriented measures (in terms of germplasm, agronomic practices \n‘adapted to communal management) and (ii) institutional arrangements (which \ncould help in promoting group action and better regulated use, including \nlands currently in open access exploitation. Research focused on enhancing \nthe range of options for the poor in MAs should include the. CPRs. .’ \nSimilarly, local level initiatives through participatory research could address \nthe institutional dimension of CPR rehabilitation and management. \nThe above possibilities can be incorporated into the Systemw’ide \ninitiative on property rights and collective action coordinated by IFPRI. As a \npart of this initiative, the question of selective privatisation of CPRs can also \nbe examined. Especially in the African context, there is a push for \nland-titling supported by the donors. The justification is to ensure proper \nincentives for land users and create collateral for credit for the farmers’using \ncommon lapds. The CPRs - due to their wider spread in terms of access and \n. spatial location, offer multiple options to the poor to cope with risk. By \n. promoting individual land entitlements, the policy may tend to restrict the \nrange of options and access to resources and opportunities available to the \npoor. There is room for researdh to examine the trade-offs. \n. \n20 \n.One way to reduce the scope of a “marginal lands” study in the initial stages \nwould be to exclude any consideration of MAs on the 800 million ha classified as FAL. \nOne might justify this on the grounds that these are the areas which most clearly have \nbenefited from the Green Revolution - if there is residual poverty on this area, this could \nbe addressed as part of a global rural poverty study. \nHowever, the conclusion was that, because of: \n- heterogeneity of ML and FL (or MAL and FAL) in landscapes, \n- the likely overriding importance of institutions in defming MAs, \n- the linkages between MAs and non-MAs in poverty alleviation within h4As, \n- the critical importance of income in poverty alleviation which dictates a research \nfocus on: food and non-food products (and associated value added); opportunities \nand constraints to off-farm sources of earnings and productivity from forest areas, \ncoastal zones and savanna woodlands (not incorporated in the definitions of FAL \nand MAL), and \n- the likelihood that definition of MAs on non-favoured areas will probably spill \nover into definition of MAs on FALs, again because of country or region- \nspecific institutions driving the poverty process, \nit would be more efficient to specify MA without regard to an arbitrary distinction between \nbiophysically favoured and marginal lands. Given the existing mix of work in the centres \n(see Chapters 3-6) it is not clear the extent to which this explicit focus on poverty \nalleviation would imply changes in the actual research project work done by the centres. \nWith the above in mind, the Panel puts forth the following first recommendation: \nRecommendation 1: The CGIAR needs to sharpen its strategic focus on poverty \nalleviation particularly in setting priorities for research related to marginal rural \nareas. A prerequisite is development of a geo-referenced d.atabase linking \nbiophysical land conditions with poverty and with the processes that produce it \n(i.e., the dynamics of poverty). \nIn order to meet this chillenge, the System, and individual centres within it, will need \nto develop a database relevant, to the design and assessment of options t.hat lead to more \neffective impacts on income of the rural poor in highly diverse marginal areas. Elements \nof this database will be the soil, climatic and terrain conditions. However, as the centres \nhave pointed out in their comments on the Phase I report, there are many other elements \nwhich are equally or more important - production systems, human capital, market access \nand infiastructuye, institutional and policy constraints and the number and location of the \nrural poor with respect to any or all of the above characteristics. A logical place to start \nthis activity would appear to be the centres’ expertise on the geographic iareas with which \nthey deal; perhaps initially by developing an intuitive Geographical Information System \n(GIS) which can be progressively improved by formal or informal metholds. The issue of \nsite specificity, diversity and complexity must be addressed to identify points of entry which \n21 \nare relevant and consistent with the CGIAR’s scale. The question here is the extent to \nwhich centres may move towards targeting site-specific (or through a typology, situation- \nspecific) rural poverty through research which meets the “international public goods” \ncriterion. \nMeeting this recommendation is regarded as a prerequisite to action on the three \nrecommendations put forward in Chapter 3. The Panel is convinced that the centres’ \nscientific expertise, coupled with their field experience in most, if not all, of the diverse \nMAs, represent a unique resource in coming to grips with the information/analytical \nchallenge. Thus the work should be undertaken in a coordinated fashion by the centres \nthemselves. IFPRI and ISNAR could take leading roles in providing support to the activity. \nAn opportunity exists to initiate this process in the up-coming MTP exercise. \n22 \nCHAPTER 3 - POVERTY ALLEVIATION ON MARGINAL \nAREAS: THE ROLE OF THE CGIAR IN REMOVING \nCONSTRAINTS \nThe previous chapter made it clear that the nature and causes of the poverty found \non marginal areas vary widely with the type of conditions which determine marginality of \nthe rural population. Thus, there are significant differences between the poor farmer on \nthe mountainous hillsides of the Andes or the Himalayas, the farmer surviving on the \nfringes of the Amazon forest or in the Zaire Basin, and the farmer on the drylands of the \nAfrican savanna woodlands. \nThe solutions to alleviate poverty for the inhabitants of these diverse lands are as \nvaried as the situations encountered. However, there are some common .th.reads - some \ncommon requirements and opportunities - that relate to most of the diverse rural poverty \nsituations encountered. These involve the actions that are necessary to deal with the \nresource, knowledge, and incentive constraints that are the fundamental barriers to \npoverty alleviation. Thus, the Panel has identified three types of requirements that all \nsituations have in common: \nl Reforming policies and institutions. This involves improving the social, \ninstitutional, and physical infrastructure (access to markets and. market information; \nprice policies; access to credit and essential purchased inputs; establishment and \nstrengthening of markets; improved property rights; improved roads, \ncommunications, transportation, and so forth); \na Generating and diffusing new and improved technologies. This applies to crop, \nlivestock, forestry, agroforestry, and fisheries. The new technologies need to fit \nthe various biophysical and institutional characteristics and constraints of the \ndiverse agricultural and associated lands; \nl Diversifying land use systems and income opportunities. This includes increasing \naccess to off-farm employment (e.g., through forestry, fisheries, and agro-industrial \nopportunities associated with improved postharvest technologies, small-scale \nenterprise development, etc.). \nFigure 3.1 provides an overview of how these three categories of \nrequirements/opportunities link to poverty alleviation for those who live in MAs. We \nemphasize the point that it generally takes integrated action in all three areas to break the \n‘vicious circle’ of poverty and to move a marginal population along the development path. \nBecause these three basic requirements are common in principle and concept \n(although not in operational detail) for nearly all marginal land-poverty types, they \nprovide promising areas in which to search for the international public goods research \nopportunities, which are the focus of the CGIAR. Thus, we look at them in more detail \nin the following chapters, after elaborating the Panel’s understanding of what the CGIAR \nfocus should be in this area. \n23 \nFigure 3.

The International Role of the CGIAR \nIn considering the CGIAR’s role in poverty alleviation for the poor residing in the \nmarginal areas of the world, the Panel took into account two basic facts: 1) the CGIAR \naccounts for only a small proportion of global agricultural, forestry and fisheries \nresearch; thus, the most that the CGIAR can hope for is to become an advocate and a \ncatalyst, albeit a key one, for positive action; 2) the CGIAR’s particular advantage - and \nits mandated role - is to provide international public goods that can contribute to \nsustainable poverty alleviation. \nThe Panel’s interpretation of the role of the CGIAR System is baseld on TAC \nconclusions, confirmed by the CGIAR members. Thus, international research initiatives \nundertaken within the System should (TAC Soil and Water Study): \nProduce research results of an international public goods nature; they should provide benefits (either \ndirectly or through externalities) across national borders. \nGlobalize (or standardize) methodologies used in local studies to ensure comparability of results \nacross ecoregions, and for use in researching common themes or problems within ecosystems; this \nshould include methodologies that integrate biophysical and socioeconomic research. \n. Involve locally relevant and responsive research within ecoregions (or watersheds), but with a global \nperspective to (1) take advantage of economies of scale in research, (2) maximize use of spillovers \nfrom research, (3) reduce transactions costs in doing research, and (4) allow efficient movement up \nthe learning curve. \nBe multisectoral and multidisciplinary in nature and scope, recognizing the different sectors and \ndisciplines dealt with across the CGIAR System. (Thus, for example, the CGIAR Systemwide \nSWNM Programme, or the proposed Water Programme should be explicitly linked to ecoregional \nactivities, to germplasm improvement and commodity research activities of selected Centres, and to \nvarious policy related research issues pursued by such Centres as IFPRI, e.g., in the area of water \npolicy and common property resource management). \nTake advantage of complementary activities of different suppliers of research, both within and \noutside the CGIAR System and contribute to the work of others, both NARS and advanced \ninstitutions. \nKeeping these priorities and criteria for CGIAR involvement in mind at all times, \nthe Panel then considered the CGIAR current activity, role, and options for the future in \neach of the three areas described above. \n3.2. Gender Considerations \nThe Panel recognized a general point that applies to most MA poverty situations - \nthe importance of women and the importance that needs to be given to gender issues. \nAccording to FAO’s latest statistics”, women’s contribution to agriculturatl production \nin Sub-Saharan Africa is some 60-80 percent of the total (compared with 50 percent in \nAsia and 40 percent in Latin America). Further, indicative figures for developing \n11 FAO 1996. ‘Women Feed the World’. FAO Fact Sheet, World Food Summit, 13- 17 November \n1996, FAO, Rome. \n25 \ncountries show, according to FAO, that no more than 5 percent of extension resources \nare received by women; yet in many areas more than 50 percent of household’s are \nheaded by women. Women’s “invisibility” is further accentuated by their lack of \npolitical power and social representation. They are less educated and, thus, their \ncontribution toward food security often is less than it could be. FAO concludes in its \nbriefing paper to the World Food Summit that: \nSince the 197Os, the number of women living below the poverty line has increased \nby 50 percent, in comparison with 30 percent for their male counterparts. More \nthan 70 percent of the 1,300 million poor people today are women. \nAnd many of these poor women live in MAs of the world and thus are of prime \ninterest to the present study. The Panel did not feel that it should single out the gender \nissue in a separate chapter or section, but rather treat the issue as an all pervasive one \nthat applies throughout the discussion that follows; and should be a central consideration, \nregardless of the path taken towards poverty alleviation in MAs. \n3.3 Scope for Research-Based Solutions td Rural Poverty \nRural poverty, particularly that associated with marginal areas, is a product of \nmultiple factors, some of which fall outside the scope of research generated by the \nCGIAR and others. Nevertheless, the System does have a significant opportunity to \nbring to bear scientific objective analysis which could have an important catalytic impact \non NARS, NGOs, the private sector and resource user communities. ’ \nTable 3.1 characterises some of the most critical gaps between the requirements \nfor research and development (R&D) for MAs and the features of ongoing research \nefforts. Frequent reference has been made to the lack of information on MAs and the \nway their inhabitants gain a livelihood. This is no accident. Those responsible for \ndecisions to collect information have considered it as either unnecessary, too costly, or a \nlow pay-off investment. The approach requires targeting the MAs, the population groups \nliving on these areas and the rural poverty sub-sector within the population. For any \narea or group, information required would include biophysical and social diversity, \nresource use patterns, survival strategies, sources of income and employment, migration \nand the dynamics of change. Focus of research based on this information should be \naimed at increasing the range and quality of options open to the poor for: \nderiving income from the resources available to them; \noperating more effectively in the market for goods and services. \nThis option-centred approach would be based on analysis of constraints and \nopportunities’2 to systematically accumulate information on options and the types of \nMA poverty situations in which they may be applied. The challenge to the CGIAR is \nthe generation of viable partnerships and formulation of a research framework to guide \n12 FAO, 1995. ‘Special Programme on Food Production in Support of Food Security in LIFDCS: \nAdvisory Note on Participatory Analysis of Constraints and Opportunities ‘. \n26 \nthe work of NARS, NGOs, etc. in assembling diagnoses and innovative field experience \nwhich will be cumulative and enriched by comparative analyses. \n3.4. The Way Ahead for the CGIAR - a Summary \nThe road to poverty alleviation for the poor living on MAs is a rocky and twisting \none. Negotiating it will require concerted effort by many parties, hopefully working in \nconcert and in a coordinated and effective way together. The role of CGIAR will be a \nminor, but crucial one. There is not much that the CGIAR can do, but ‘what it can do is \nessential to the process. \nBasically, the Panel sees the CGIAR as being able to move further i.n three main \ndirections: \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nIt can provide support to policy and institutional reforms, through its work on \nidentification of poverty processes and constraints to its alleviation; work in the \narea of identifying, locating, and classifying the areas and types of poverty for \nwhich it is best equipped to address; and work in the area of policy and institution \nstrengthening. Many of the critical needs in the latter area already have been \nexplored by the panel producing TAC’s recent strategic studies on policy research \nand institution strengthening research and service needs. \nIt can continue with its mainstream work with commodity improvement in \nagriculture, forestry, agroforestry, and fisheries, but with added emphasis on . \nbreeding and agronomic work related to the needs of the MA conditions, e.g., \nneed for drought tolerant varieties,’ work on integrated soil nutrient and water \nbalances and utilization, work on IPM and other more environment friendly \napproaches to agricultural intensification and improvement. \nThe CGIAR can continue on the path of increased support to natural resources \nmanagement research, and research related to land use diversification and land use \nsystems approaches to the problems of MAs. This trend was started some eight \nyears ago, when the CGIAR diversified and expanded its mandate to take on \nforestry, agroforestry , and fisheries. More recently, the System has endorsed \nTAC’s recommendations and centre initiatives with regard to greater focus on \nIntegrated Natural Resources Management, soil and water research, integrated pest \nmanagement, ecoregional approaches to research, expansion of work on \npostharvest technologies, and various policy and institution strengthening activities \nthat contribute to more diversified land use and farming systems approaches. \n27 \nTable 3.1: Imperatives for Poverty-Oriented R&D and Dominant \nCharacteristics of Current Research for MAs \n1.

Imperatives of biophysical conditions \nrelated to social processes: Strong agro- \necosystem social system linkages to shape \nchoice and design of production options and \npractices as a part of diversified farming \nsystem; Institutional arrangements for \nresource-use regulation. \nDespite good work on farming systems, \nresearch has been persistently top-down \ndisregarding indigenous systems and \nparticipatory approaches, resulting partly from \nsubsidiary role of social sciences; inadequate \nattention to institutional aspects. \nSource: Adapted from Jodha, N.S. 1991. ‘Sustainable Agriculture in Fragile Resource \nZones: Technological Imperatives ‘. Economic and Political Weekly. Vol. 26 \n(13). \n28 \nThe CGIAR System has been moving towards expansion of activities that relate \ndirectly or indirectly to the poverty issues encountered in the MAs. The I?anel now is \nsuggesting that this focus be strengthened and that some of the System’s work be directly \ntargeted to poverty alleviation for those living in MAs - always keeping in. mind, of \ncourse, that the System should only be addressing those issues which have: international \ndimensions and for which the international public goods constraint holds, and for which \nthe System and its centres have a clear advantage vis-a-vis the many other actors \ninvolved. \nIt is clear to the Panel that a focus on poverty alleviation brings witlh it a number of \nchallenges related to the identification, development and organization of research. Chief \namong these is that because of the heterogeneity and site-specificity of MAs and their \ninternal diversity and complexity, there is a need to develop new forms of partnerships \nwith NARS, NGOs, developed country institutions, and multi and bilateral agencies. \nPoverty alleviation as an over-arching objective implies a set of actors and a set of \nactions that go far beyond the areas in which the CGIAR has strengths. The Panel \nstresses this point and its fii conclusion that the CGIAR should not spread its efforts too \nthin. The three broad areas of activity discussed above are ones in which the CGIAR \nlegitimately could become - or is - involved. However, its role will be narrow and small, \nalbeit important. The key to success is establishment of the right kinds of partnerships. \nIts focus on systematic accumulation and dissemination of information and on \nmethodology for addressing complex site-specific rural poverty situations should provide \nthe necessary legitimacy to attract other actors. Thus, the Panel recommends that: \nRecommendation 2: The centres should establish new forms of partnership iu \norder to effectively address their roles in a broader poverty alleviation strategy \nrelated to those who live in marginal rural areas. \nThe Panel believes that the poverty alleviation focus can help provide impetus for \ndevelopment of innovative and effective approaches to partnership with NARS, NGOs and \nvarious other groups. Such partnerships will depend on fmding complementary sources \nof funding for all partners involved. It will also imply development of incentives for long \nterm collaboration and cooperation, since poverty alleviation is an evolutionary process. \nThese activities will be facilitated once the eco-regional approach becomes operational. \nTwo additional points regarding the way ahead need to be stressed here: \nNeed to understand land and water degradation processes. As discussed in the \nTAC Soil and Water study, there is need to improve our understanding of land and water \ndegradation processes. This is relevant to the purpose of the present study. There \nappears to be little hard evidence linking the poor, in contrast to the non-poor, to \naccelerated resource degradation. Degradation processes need to be understood and then \nlinked to the poverty processes. In the case of MAs, reversal of their degradation \nprocesses will require resource-centred technologies beyond the crop-centred focus which \nhas characterised much agricultural research to date. \n29 \nNeed to understand why research results on the shelf are not used for yield \nenhancement. Whether one is considering policy/institutions research, technology and \nsystems research, or research on diversification options, there are many good results on \nthe shelves of research centres which have never been used. As also suggested in the \nTAC Soil and Water study, the CGIAR System needs to understand better why good \ntechnologies are not put to use. \nThere is considerable pressure to expand research designed to reduce the rate of \nresource degradation which has led to encroachment on forests, salinization, loss of wetland \nand erosion. Results are manifested in severe shortages of fnelwood, the drying up of \nsprings and streams, loss of valuable and relatively unique sources of genetic diversity. For \nexample, some of the richest areas of biodiversity in the East and Central African highlands \nare under threat of disappearing due to changes in land use management. The Panel debated \ndeveloping new and separate recommendations regarding both degradation and productivity, \nand decided that it could make the points better by reaffirming the recommendations as they \ncame out of the TAC Soil and Water study, but with the added emphasis on linking the \nresulting information with poverty processes related to marginal areas. Better information \nis needed on the degradation processes, couched in the context of issues related to fragility \nand resilience, and to consideration of issues related to pollution, biodiversity loss and loss \nof other environmental services. Thus, the Panel puts forth the following two \nrecommendations: \nRecommendation 3: The CGIAR System should develop improved mechanisms by \nwhich centres can be involved with other partners in generating and interpreting \nimproved scientific evidence on: (i) the extent and magnitude of the impacts of \nagriculture, forestry and fisheries on the degradation or enhancement of natural \nresources and the consequences for production and food security; and (ii) the \nlinkage between poverty and observed resource degradation. \nRecommendation 4: Expanded collaborative mechanisms and activities should be \ndeveloped among the centres, and between centres and their non-CGIAR partners, \nto help focus research and institutional strengthening on issues related to \nadoption, adaption, and utilisation of research results that so far have remained \nunused. \nThe Panel is concerned that its recommendations related to expanded research, \nparticularly on technologies, should be realistic and should take into account the problems \nin dissemination and adoption of such research. In a poverty alleviation context, the poor \nwould not benefit from more and more research if the results merely sit on the shelves of the \nscientists and their agencies. This recommendation links closely to the discussion in Chapter \n4 related to developing a better understanding of the aspirations and incentives of the poor \nfrom MAs. \n30 \nCHAPTER 4 - REFORMING POLICIES AND INSTTWTIONS: \nROLE OF THE CGIAR \nNo matter how good the quality of land, poverty cannot be addressed effectively if \na perverse set of policies keeps people from meeting their potentials and eiffectively keeps \nthem from taking advantage of opportunities to better themselves economically. The poor \nin MAs in most cases are not poor only because of the biophysical quality of their land \nresources. In fact, in many MAs, there are large pockets of land that are of quite good \nquality for agricultural production; but institutional or policy barriers keep the poor \nfarmers poor. \nThe conceptual and analytical framework developed in Chapter 4 indicated that \nreform of policies and institutions is one of the three major areas of need that cuts across \nnearly all poverty situations for those living on the MAs of the world. In the present \nchapter we address this area of concern in terms of a) what it involves; b) what the \nCGIAR currently is doing to deal with it; and c) what the Panel sees as the options for \nthe future for intensification of CGIAR effort in this area. \nIt is clear that research is needed to identify the specific types of poverty situations, \nand the poverty processes encountered in different geographical areas. Once such \ninformation is in hand, then research is needed on the policy options .that lbest can remove \nthe barriers that exist in specific poverty situations. This type of information is also \nessential for design of other research targeted to poverty alleviation where policy or \ninstitutional constraints are expected to persist. \n4.1. Nature of the Issues Involved \nThe Panel considers that there are three basic categories of barriers to poverty \nalleviation in MAs: those related to availability of knowledge (people knowing what is \nright and possible to do, and how to do it); those related to availability of resources \n(people having the ability to take action, purchase necessary inputs, and so forth); and \nthose related to existence of incentives to take action toward poverty alleviation (people \nhaving the motivation to do it). \nTo deal with these constraints, governments have three basic types of policy \ninstruments: regulatory mechanisms; fiscal and jinancial mechanisms; and institutional \nmechanisms. An effective policy and institutional reform program must deal with all \nthree of these in the context of all the barriers encountered. A holistic approach is \nessential, since all the pieces have to fit together. \n31 \n4.2. Current Activity and Future Options for the CGIAR \nExamples of targeted activities here are IFPRI’s research projects on: (i) sustainable \ndevelopment of fragile rainfed lands; and (ii) policy, technology and institutional options \nfor arresting deforestation and resource degradation in the forest margins of the humid \ntropics. \nThe first project expects to generate knowledge about fragile land management for \na wide group of users including policymakers, aid agencies, development agencies, \nNGOs, researchers, farmers in Central American hillsides, East African highlands, \nSoutheast Asian hillsides, West African Sahel and dryland India working on natural \nresources management and in promoting sustainable land management. The second \nproject expects to produce a set of policy, technological and institutional insights of broad \napplicability to the problem of managing growth and resource use in the humid forest \nregions of developing countries. Those likely to use the knowledge include researchers \nand administrators in NARS and policymakers at all levels in developing countries and \npolicymakers in aid and lending agencies. The ultimate beneficiaries of this research are \nsmall farmers and the communities they comprise, as well as larger farming operations \nand populations engaged in extractive activities. \nAs explored in Chapter 2, in many MA poverty situations, the key bottlenecks are \nrelated to weak institutions and perverse or ineffective policies. While the CGIAR \nSystem is addressing some of these issues, they need to be emphasized more, particularly \nin a poverty alleviation context. \nHowever, a fundamental problem is lack of adequate data on the location, nature, \nextent, and causes of rural poverty in the MAL regions of the world. Thus, the Panel \nsees as a first priority the development of a useful data base that will help centres (and \ntheir partners in this poverty alleviation work) identify target populations and issues, \nassess which comparative situations should be addressed by CGIAR work, and design \napproaches to the research likely will be most productive. An example of CGIAR \ninvolvement in assembling baseline data and background diagnostic studies of institutional \nand policy issues in a broader problem-solving context is the Alternatives to \nSlash-and-Burn (ASB) programme. It is an example of how the System fits within the \noverall picture, focusing on the international public goods aspects (through the \ncomparative studies of sites and through work with NARS that involves spillovers). It is \nalso an example of how poverty alleviation, community stabilization, and environmental \nprotection objectives can be’brought together in an integrated fashion. Other Systemwide \ninitiatives also have similar objectives for international comparative analysis of specific \nsite studies, in some cases using the ecoregional approach, which the System presently is \nstruggling to define and operationalize (cf. the ongoing Centre Directors’ study to \noperationalize the approach). \nThe Panel believes that the added emphasis and focus on poverty alleviation as a \ndirect target for research may help to add further focus, clarification, and logic to the \necoregional approach to institutional and policy research - an internationally productive \n32 \nand valid activity for CGIAR involvement, expected to lead to locally relevant results \nuseful, both in terms of development of research processes and in terms of substance. \nCGIAR research should be focused on understanding the processes by which \npoverty can be alleviated, particularly in the context of what is possible folr the MAs on \nwhich the poor live. It should compare across countries the dynamics of MAs as they \nmove in and out of that category; it should be comparing the potential contributions of \ncrops, livestock, fisheries, forests and trees, of policy changes, of option for value added \nand off-farm employment, and of technology advancements under different country and \nregional conditions; and it should draw process oriented conclusions from such \ncomparative research. Centres within the System should be working on improvements in \nthe information base on poverty; they should be working on the means for improving \nconstraint analysis on poverty, i.e., on the means for identifying the key constraints to \npoverty alleviation in given rural development contexts. Such process research (strategic \nor applied) should involve consideration of changes over time, comparability of results \nacross ecoregional production systems, and mechanisms for translating results through \nadaptive research done by NARS. \n33 \nCHAPTER5 - GENERATING NEW AND IMPROVED \nTECHNOLOGIES: ROLE OF TME CGIAR \nPoverty cannot be addressed for those living on MAs if there is not some \nimprovement in productivity on the MLs and FLs within the respective areas. \nProductivity increases depend to a great extent on improvement in the technologies \navailable to meet the particular conditions found in the specific MA being addressed. \nCorrecting policy and institutional distortions is only part of the picture; and which, in \npractice, have proved to be an intractable question in many countries. As indicated in \nChapter 3, the poor in MAs regions in most cases are not poor only because of the \nbiophysical quality of their land resources. In fact, in many cases, the significant areas of \nland within a MA may only be missing a few technical adjustments in order to take off in \nterms of production. Local knowledge, combined with research can often provide the \nanswer on how to address the problems. \nMarginal areas are marginal for many reasons. In some cases, technologies can be \ndeveloped that move lands from marginal productivity to higher productivity. The most \nobvious example is irrigation of deserts - where such is economically feasible and \ndesirable. However, there are other, less obvious, but just as important examples, e.g., \ngreater integration of range livestock systems into mixed farming or agroforestry \ntechnologies that increase productivity and farmer incomes, while at the same time \nreducing risk through diversification. \nEstimates from FAO suggest that over the next couple of decades, about 80 percent \nof the production expansion will be associated with yield increases and some 20 percent \nwith agricultural land expansioni3. There is no reliable breakdown for MAs and non- \nMAs. However, yield increases will be an important source of growth on both areas. \n5.1. The New Green Revolution - Technologies for Marginal Lands \nThe past approach to solving the food crises of the sixties and seventies in \ndeveloping countries was through the introduction of Green Revolution technologies. The \nresult was agricultural intensification on those areas which were more favoured in terms \nof biophysical conditions, market access, infrastructure and supporting institutions or \npolicy; heavy doses of fertilizers, - high-yielding fertilizer responsive varieties, fast \nmaturing species, irrigation, improved soil and water management, and use of chemicals \nto control pests and diseases. There is criticism of the Green Revolution technologies, \ne.g., that they have resulted in increased income inequalities, in problems of salinization \nand waterlogging in irrigated areas, and in health problems due to heavy use of \nchemicals. The evidence on the seriousness of these criticisms is mixed \n(FAO 199614, and Freebairn 199S5). \n13 \n14 \nFAO 1996. ‘World Agriculture: Towards 2010’. N. Alexandratos, ed. John Wiley & Sons. \nFAO 1996. ‘Lessons from the Green Revolution - Towards a New Green Revolution’. FAO \nTechnical Background Document 6, World food Summit, 13-17 November 1996, FAO, Rome. \n34 \nWhile agriculture (including ranching) legitimately can be blamed for most of the \ndeforestation that has taken place in the world, it also is the case that the Green \nRevolution technologies for agricultural intensification have had some positive indirect \nenvironmental impacts related to forests. For example, the CGIAR estimates that without \nthe technological advances brought about by the Green Revolution, some 280 million ha \nmore land would have been needed to produce the same amount of wheat, maize, rice and \nother food crops that are part of the CGIAR mandate. It is doubtful whether such a large \narea of land would have been available, particularly in the areas where needed to meet the \nfood requirements. But if even part of the 280 million ha would have been converted for \nagricultural production, a great deal more forest and fragile land would have been cleared \nand degraded without the Green Revolution. \nDespite the advances in technology and agricultural productivity, and. land savings \nthat have taken place due to increases in per hectare productivity, forest land clearing for \nagriculture continues. Almost two thirds of the forest land that is deforested every year \ngoes into agricultural expansion, including cattle ranching, particularly in the case of \nLatin America. On that part converted to slash and burn agriculture the relsult is \nmarginalization of the lands cleared after three years or so. A key point here is that most \nof the deforestation is done by those poor people who were not the direct target of the \nGreen Revolution - the poor who either come from the MAs or from the MAs via the \ncities (the rural to urban migrants coming home to the land). \nThe way forward, in terms of reducing poverty and food insecurity and in terms of \nimproving the environmental impacts of agriculture in MAs regions, ‘will involve a \ncomplex of factors. It will involve taking the best from the old Green Revolution \ntechnologies and combining them with a new generation of ideas, technologies, and \ninstitutional arrangements - what FAO (1996, op. tit .) calls the Second Agricultural \nParadigm: \nIt takes the natural constraints largely as given and explores the possibilities for inc.reased yields by \nimproved genetic material and changes in management without recourse to large amounts of external \ninputs. It recognizes that there will be sizeable groups in the farming communities that are de facto \nexcluded from the broader socio-economic enabling environment.. . .Examples of approaches under \nthis second paradigm include: breeding of crop varieties that are tolerant to adverse: soil \nconditions;. . . soil nutrient cycling;. . . reliance on genetic pest and disease resistance to replace, either \npartially or fully, chemical and mechanical pest control; the active use of functional biodiversity, \nwhere predators and other natural control agents of pests and diseases are actively encouraged \nthrough the maintenance of complex ecosystems within and adjacent to farming activities; and \nincreased production from naturally trypanosomiasis-tolerant cattle and small ruminants that can \nlower the need for large-scale tsetse fly eradication, with its many ecological implications (p.4). \n5.2. Current Activity and Future Options for the CGIAR \nIn the recent review of CGIAR priorities and strategies, TAC concluded that for \npoor countries where much of the labour force is in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries \nsectors and much of the average budget is spent on food and non-food products from \n15 Freebaim, D.K. 1995. ‘Did the Green Revolution Concentrate Incomes? A Quantitative Study of \nResearch Reports’. World Development. Vol. 23, pp. 265-279. \n35 \nthese three sectors, increases in the productivity of biological products (foodstuff, fodder, \nfeed, fuelwood and raw material for people, livestock and industry) offers the best \nopportunity to stimulate economic growth. The rural poor engaged in the production \nprocess and/or the post-production processing activities benefit directly from such \neconomic growth, whereas the urban poor benefit indirectly through lower prices. \nA significant proportion of research by the centres has been oriented to production \nissues which have directly benefited the poor. A good example is the work by IITA and \ntheir NARS partners on the biological control of the cassava mealy bug. This work led to \nintegrated control of striga for improving total factor productivity of small farmers in the \nmoist and dry savanna of sub-Saharan Africa. This benefited the poor regardless of the \ntype of land. There is evidence that tree fallows and fodder banks promoted by ILRI \nhave benefited poor producers in a wide variety of marginal areas in the same region. \nAdditional examples relate to ILRI’s production systems research in the semi-arid tropics \nin maintenance of land productivity for livestock farmers, and the streak virus-resistant \nmaize and the mosaic virus-free cassava cultivars released by IITA. In Asia, there is \nevidence that farmers’ incomes have increased in recent years as a result of the adoption \nof ICRISAT’s cultivars of pearl millet, sorghum, groundnut, and pigeonpea. In the case \nof pearl millet, the aim is improved productivity and stability in semi-arid tropical \nenvironments through development of downey mildew and ergot resistant cultivars and \nhybrids with drought tolerance for poor farmers. Similar examples can be cited for Latin \nAmerica, e.g. the acid-tolerant rice and sorghum cultivars. For the WANA region, \nICARDA’s work in the area of soil fertility and water management has provided direct \nbenefit to the producers. In addition, its research on the rehabilitation of pasture lands \nhas played an important part in control of degradation on grazed hillsides. \nDevelopment of new and improved technology has been, and likely will continue to \nbe, the main strength of the CGIAR. In the area of technologies that can help in the \nbattle to alleviate poverty for those living in the MAs of the world, the CGIAR has made \nsignificant progress. The need now is to shift somewhat the focus of selected strategic \nresearch on commodity improvement, land use management, and other subjects to fit \nwithin the (diverse, site-specific MA) poverty alleviation focus suggested here. \nThis means, among other things, more attention to drought resistance and varieties \ntolerant to salinity and focusing additional efforts on the problems of the acid soils, issues \nrelated to nutrient mining, water harvesting and other water management technologies, to \nname a few examples. The choice of focus should be made by the centres, in the context \nof the MAs to which their research applies, either individually or in concert with others. \nThe role of biotechnology in genome mapping and the development of cultivars \nresistant to abiotic and biotic stresses also is of importance when looking at the potential \ncontributions of the CGIAR to marginal lands research. There are many opportunities to \ndevelop “ . . .technologies that can be usefully employed given the existing, often adverse, \nconditions” l6 found in the MAs. Such technologies can be of immense benefit to the \npoor; and, if coupled with activity in the other areas discussed here - institutional and \n16 Ravenborg, H.M. 1993. ‘Targeting International Agricultural Research Towards the Rural Poor’. \nCDR Working Paper 93.4 (Centre for Development Research in cooperation with IFPRI). \n36 \npolicy reform, diversification and niche opportunities - they can provide one important \ninput for poverty alleviation. \nWithin the context of working on poverty alleviation for those living in MAs, the \nPanel believes that the centres and their various partners in research should be developing \nnew and improved technologies that respond to site conditions found in MAs, e.g., \nvarieties resistant to a variety of abiotic stresses. \nThis should not be interpreted to mean the centres should engage in .research on \ngenetic improvement or management systems for hundreds of speciality crops and animals \nwhich may offer niche potentials in an equal or greater number of site-specific (or \nsite-type) situations. As mentioned above, the CGIAR is already doing research on a \nwide range of products which are relevant to the poor in MAs. The new dimension may \nimply a few additional products, but the main thrust is on research (biophysical and social \nscience) aimed at increasing the income options available to the poor. A prerequisite is \nresearch to clarify the capabilities, constraints and range of options (agriculture and \nnon-agriculture) available in a set of MA situations, into which it is expectled to apply the \nSvstem’s research results - species, management, value added, etc. \nThe ingredients introduced through the CGIAR will be research in the mandated \nbiophysical area, responsive to constraints and opportunities in MAs, plus .interrelated \nsocial science research aimed at new institutional arrangements which will enable the poor \nto mobilize their indigenous knowledge on niches and value added. The role of the \nCGIAR in the latter area is in the development of approaches to constraint analysis and \nassessment of options. \n37 \nCHAPTER 6 - DIVERSIFYING LAND USE SYSTEMS AND \nINCOME OPPORTUNITIES: ROLE OF THE CGIAR \nThe Director General of FAO, in commenting on the marginal lands issue, points \nout that: \nIn marginal areas, farmers often spread the risk by engaging in mixed systems that combine \nagriculture with other economic activities. We need to draw upon such ancestral wisdom and \nencourage combined activities in their appropriate ecological and socio-economic setting. They are \nan expression of sustainable agricultural development, successfully merging cropping, stock raising, \npoultry farming, fish culture, forestry, hunting and gathering, the sale of produce on local markets, \nseasonal migration and all sorts of activities that mark the rhythm ‘of a farming household’s working \nyear. (Statement of the DG on the occasion of World Food Day, Rome, 16 October, 1996) \nPoverty is associated with significant risks for the poor. They do not have the \n“safety net” that richer people have through their savings and, most commonly, through \nthe social systems to which they belong. The poor often are on their own - in fact that is \na major factor associated with their poverty, which derives from the institutional and \npolicy context. However, correcting policy and institutional problems is only part of the \npicture. Diversification of land use and farming system activities and income \nopportunities cuts across nearly all poverty situations in MAs. \nThe Panel recognizes that some of the diversification options mentioned below are \nmerely part of a “holding pattern” - stop-gap measures that will maintain rural poor, but \nnot lead to poverty alleviation and economic development. For that to happen, broader \nmarkets need to develop for non-agricultural products, .education and technology \ndevelopment need to come to the forefront; and access for the poor to various social \nservices and income generating opportunities needs to be improved. These changes are . \nfar beyond the scope and mandate of the CGIAR in its present form. It can help in terms \nof what it knows best - the institutional and technological change related to agriculture, \nagroforestry , forestry, and fisheries. \n6.1. Diversi&ation: Nature of the Needs and Opportunities. \nDiversification can involve a number of things - and the type of diversification that \nbest fits a situation in MAs will depend very much on the nature of the poverty issues in \nthat particular region. Where diversification is to be-based on natural resources available \nto the poor, it is evident that knowledge of the biophysically marginal and favoured lands \nwithin any specific MA will be critical. \nIn general, the most promising types of diversification opportunities include the \nfollowing: . \nb increased integration and further intensification of livestock in mixed farming \nsystems - expansion of on-farm activities; \nb introduction or improvement of agroforestry systems that provide various products \nboth, for home consumption and for markets, and that improve agricultural \nproductivity in some cases; \nb increased integration of forest-based activities into overall farming systems \ndevelopment and into poverty alleviation programmes for the landles#s; \nincreased blending of off-farm employment and income generating activities with \nfarm system management and increased vertical integration of farm activities \nfrom field to consumer using new developments in postharvest technologies; \nincreased use of niche opportunities - using exotic and indigenous, often \nunderutilized, plants and animals; and taking advantage of small areas of good land, \nor other unique attributes, to produce high value crops such as flowers, herbs, \nspices, rabbits, honey, etc. \n6.2. Livestock: Expansion of On-Farm Activities \n38 \nAnimal products are generally characterized by a high consumer preference. Given \nthis, and the “walking~bank” role of animals in small farms, farmers tend to respond \nfavourably to opportnnities for increasing the numbers of small or large animals to \nimprove farm income. Thus, diversifying production into mixed crop-livestock systems \nor intensifying livestock production is often of strong interest to farmers in most parts of \nthe world. \nAt the farm level, livestock can contribute to sustainability with its various \ninterfaces with cropping and with the farming household (sales can be year-round sources \nof cash income, animals serve as mobile assets, supply of fuel material, supply of nutrient \nrich food). The integration and intensification of livestock keeping is a reliable way to \nstimulate income or consumption growth at the farm level, especially when farm-based \ninputs can be used in this process. In diversification, farm animals play an important \nlinkage role between different sub-sets of the farming system as means of draught power \nfor recycling nutrients and enhancing land productivity. Crop by-products and refuse can \nbe fed to monogastric as well as ruminant animals. Under diversified land use coarse \n. grains and (sown) pastures, fodder trees, and fodder shrubs on marginal lands can provide \nfeed and can also restore soil fertility. \nThe year-round increase’of livestock production is, furthermore, an ideal way to \nincrease labour productivity. mile cropping is characterized by peak labour demands, \nthe steady work needed for livestock husbandry can spread requirements more evenly \nover time, thereby increasing labour efficiency. On-farm processing of animal products \n(butter, ghee, cheese) and local self-marketing are other possibilities to add value by \nlinking available labour with production resources to obtain the larger benefits. Examples \nof expansion of on-farm activities involving livestock are given in Box 2. \nBox 2: Expansion of on-farm activities through livestock \nExample .I: Stall Feeding \nIn Kenya a small .farm of 0.3 hectare supports Thomas Nzaea, his wife, three children and \ngrandmother by a system of no-graze dairy production. Thomas converted the farm from the \ntypical crops such as maize, beans and. cash crops to a stall feeding dairy byproducts farm. \nThe fodder from a hybrid of Leucaena leucocephala’and Calliandra calothyrsus is used as feed. \nFlowers fi-om the trees provide nectar for side production of honey. The manure from the \ncattle is abundant enough to fertilize his field. The field is cropped with rows of the hybrid and \nspinach and other greens. Fuelwood is always abundant. The excess milk and manure are \nsold. Complimentary feeds are purchased and extra money is reinvested. Thomas puichased a \nshredder that mixes the fodder to an optimal nutritional formula and put his children through \nschool. \nPrinsley, R.T., 1990.

A project in northwest .Peru, \ncovering 1000 hectare, is attempting to reverse the tides. The area is characterized as semi- \ndesert sand dunes. Three varieties of trees have been planted: Prosopis chilensis, \nP. limensis and P. juliflora, with a spacing of IO m x 10 m, five seeds to a hole. The trees are \nintercropped with beans from year I to Gear 4, from year 4 to year 30 pods from the trees will \nbe used for animal feed, food, molasses and honey, sheep grazing and bird hunting wiIl be \nintroduced during this time period. At year 30 timber will he harvested and regeneration \ninitiated. In addition, the stand will provide woodfuel. Two years into the project trees are \nproducing fruit at about US%25 per hectare and pods at US!$200 per hectare. \nTian van Nao, 1983. Agroforestry Systems and Some Research Problems, In: Huxley, P.A.; \n1983. “Plant Research and Agroforestry. ’ ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya. \n6.3. Agroforestry: Making Marginal Lands More Productive \nAgroforestry is widely practised and has been for centuries in most countries. In \nmajor parts of the developing world, it is the main form of land use and a major \ncontributor to sustainability. Yet, because agroforestry lies in the hazy area somewhere \nbetween the fields of forestry and agriculture, it does not have the constituency, nor \nreceive the attention it deserves in the policy arena in terms of its potential to contribute \nto poverty alleviation for those who live in MAs. \nAgroforestry to a great extent evolved in response to needs and to sustainability \nconcerns related to resiliency, flexibility, and avoidance of negative side effects of \nagriculture. Because of its blending of production with protection, it fits nicely with the \nconcept of conservation and forces divergent views to focus on sustaining the overall \nproductivity of land in MAs. \n40 \nBy design agroforestry should provide both environmental and productivity benefits. \nAt the same time, farmers have to be aware that the use of trees in agricultural systems is \nnot always positive in terms of sustainability and income generation. For example, trees \ncan be introduced in such a way that they compete for space, light, nutrients, and water \nwith other crops, thus possibly reducing the overall value of production. \nExperience and careful study are needed to find those combinations of trees and \nother land uses that maximize overall sustainable production. The need fo:r careful \nresearch on agroforestry is most pronounced in relation to biophysically marginal areas, \nwhere sensitivity to misuse tends to be greater. In some cases, it might mean no trees; \nin other cases, it might mean total forest cover. In between are the productive \nagroforestry systems. \nBased on ICRAF’s experience these systems can contribute to poverty alleviation \nand sustainability of farming in MAs in three important ways: \nl building in flexibility to deal with uncertainty and the dynamics of changing \nneeds; \nl improving the resiliency of a land use; and \nl creating positive externalities and linkages among land-use practices and their \nimpacts. \n6.4. Forests and Diversification of Land Use Activities’for Poverty . \nAlleviation \nThe links between forests, trees, food security and deforestation shown in Figure \n. 6.1 indicate that there is a two-way relationship between agriculture and forests. On the \none hand, the major source of deforestation is agriculture (particularly slash.and burn \nagriculture and large scale cattle ranching). On the other hand, agroforestry systems and \nforests contribute to increased food security, income generation and poverty alleviation. \nPackages of new options for diversification in MAs include improved use of forests \nand trees. It has been estimated that a significant part of rural poor people: depend in a \nmajor way on forests for their benefit flows. The Panel recognizes that improvement and \nexpansion of forest and tree related activity by the poor in MAs is only one small part of \nthe diversification needed. However, in some areas it can be an important part in solving \nthe poverty alleviation puzzle. \nSome promising areas of forest and tree related diversification - at least in the’ early \nstages of development - include the following: \nForest foods for subsistence ,and as sources of income. Outputs from the forest \n(bushmeat and fish, fruits, nuts, gums, resins, and so forth) supplement agricultural \noutputs in many parts of the world. Studies by IFPN, CIFOR and others indicate that \nfarmers in many forest regions of the world, e.g., Zaire Basin and the Amazon, depend \nas much on the surrounding forest as the farm for their food and other prolducts, both \n41 \nthose used on the farm and marketed. A study for over 60 countries showed that game \nand fish contribute 20 percent or more of the animal protein in the average human diet. \nAnother study estimated that around 1974 some 75 percent of sub-Saharan Africa \ndepended largely on traditional wildlife sources of protein. Many similar studies confirm \nthese general orders of magnitude17. The ASB research programme is addressing the \npotentials for improved linkages between forest fringe farming, use of forests, poverty \nalleviation, and reductions in deforestation. \nBioenergy from trees. Fuelwood grown on farms, or taken from forests, provides \nthe major source of cooking and heating energy for a majority of people in most \ndeveloping countries. Adequate fuel is an essential ingredient in any poverty alleviation \nprogramme. Fuelwood, particularly converted to charcoal, provides a significant source \nof income for many rural people. It provides another link in the diversification of rural \nactivity in many MAs. However, much research is needed to understand the various \nlinkages between use of fuelwood, deforestation, and health issues (mainly from the \ninhalation of smoke). \nProtecting watersheds. Forests and use of trees in land use systems can contribute \nto downstream agriculture, e.g., through regulation of water flows and quality that \ndirectly affects irrigation options. Furthermore, it is well known that forests have a \nbeneficial and regulating impact on the hydrological conditions of a watershed, such as \nthe presence of springs, higher groundwater level, creeks with water for longer time \nperiods. \n6.5. Expansion of Off-Farm Employment and Vertical Integration of \nFarm Activities - \nIn many parts of the world, e.g., in the middle Himalayas, parts of the highlands of \nAfrica and Latin America and drylands, population growth is such that expansion of off- \nfarm sources of employment will become a necessity. The land in those areas just will \nnot support the growing numbers of people. \nWe can illustrate the potentials with some numbers from the small scale enterprise \nsector involving trees and forest products. FAO estimates, for example, that India \ncurrently has some 30 million persons working in forest-related enterprises. In Brazil, \nmore than two million people earn a significant part of their income from activities \nassociated with extraction of various products from the wild babassu palm. Similar \nstories abound from around the world. Many of these activities involve women and \nprovide them with a supplemental source of income, often used to purchase food. \n17 Redford, K., R. Godshalk and K. Asher. 1995. ‘What about Wild Animals? Wild Animal Species in \nCommunity Forestry in the Tropics ‘. FAO Community Forestry Note 13. FAO. Rome, Italy. 96pp. \n42 \nFigure 6.1: Links Between Forests and Food Production \n43 \nMany other important sources of off-farm income exist. Their development often \nbecomes the first step in evolving a balanced economy that goes beyond nearly total \ndependence on agriculture for income. Yet, the Panel recognizes the problems involved \nin generating markets. Most commonly, the products produced in these small scale \nenterprises are not of the quality where they can be exported out of the region; and the \nlocal markets, because of the depressed nature of much of the agriculture, are not large \nenough to support significant off-farm activity. The CGIAR has a limited role in this \narea. However, in some instances, it might be a catalyst in linking increased farm \nactivity to off-farm opportunities. \nAnother area which recently was reported on by a TAC panel is that of postharvest \ntechnologies. That study” recommended that the CGIAR give greater emphasis to the \nharvest and postharvest components of the production-to-consumption continuum. In \nMAs, postharvest losses can be great; value added to crops can go outside the regions; \nand opportunities to generate added off-farm employment can be lost. Thus, the Panel \nendorses the recommendations of the TAC postharvest technology study as being relevant \nto improvement in conditions in MAs and, ultimately, can contribute to poverty \nalleviation. An example is CIAT’s work on storage, processing and marketing of cassava \nin the Andean region. \n6.6. Increased Emphasis on Niche Opportunities and Underutilized \nPlants and Animals \nClosely related to livestock, agroforestry, postharvest technology and vertical \nintegration options, is the opportunity to diversify on the basis on “niche” opportunities. \nThese generally are crops that currently are underutilized, for which promising \ntechnologies and defined markets exist, and for which there is suitable pockets of land \nwithin the MAs. Examples include, spices, herbs, mushrooms, honey bees, various tree \ncrops, flowers, fruits and vegetables. Experience to date indicates that individual \nopportunities, with a few exceptions, are not large. However, on a cumulative basis, \nniche crops can be an important element in an overall diversification and poverty \nalleviation programmes (see Box 3). \nPossibilities exist also to integrate aquaculture activities into farming systems in \nsome parts of the world. Gains through research have led to some promising varieties of \ntilapia, carp, and so forth. ICLARM is in the forefront of this work. \n6.7. Current Activity and Future Options for the CGIAR \nWith the introduction of agroforestry, forestry, and fisheries into the CGIAR, the \nSystem already had started on the road towards research on issues related to land use and \n18 TAC Secretariat. 1996. ‘Harvest and Postharvest Problems in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries - \nThe CGIAR Contribution to Research -‘. (SDR/TAC:IAR/96/5). \n44 \nfarming system diversification. The strong emphasis on NRM, in an INRM context (cf. \nTAC’s Soil and Water strategic study), has led a number of centres to emphasize \nBox 3: Niche Opportqnities \nIn the semi arid parts of India in small pockets people produce grapes \nand oranges and tamarind which not only have nationwide demand; but the \nproducts are exported as brand names such as Mahagrapes from the state of \nMaharastra; the s&e is true of onion, garlic and red chilfy. In many MAL \nareas, vegetable seeds are produced ‘for green revolution FAL areas, .as the \nformer’s climate is disease and poIlution free. This occurs more in hill areas \nwhere they not only produce disease free seeds, but off-season vegetables as \nwell as flowers and fruits for the FAL and their urban centres. Sericulture \nand dryland honiculmre are picking up even on small farms in areas as dry \nas Western Rajasthan in India. Recent trends in small-state stall-fed goat \nraising, and angora rabbit rearing have helped the poor, as these enterprises \ndo not need much land or investment; and they are ‘highly productive both \nbiologically and econoniically . ICRISAT generated high-yielding pigeonpea \ncultivars which, aside from commercial use, is also planted in courtyards by \nfarmers and landless households for quick production and sale as green \nvegetable in villages nearer the towns. In most of these cases accessibility \nand nearness of market has played an important role. These processes \nrecently have been encouraged by entry of organized private sector entities \nin rural areas following the liberalization of the economy. In- some cases \nNGOs have helped. Replication of such small-scale initiatives can make a \nbig difference to the situation of the poor in marginal areas. \nboth production and conservation objectives related to diversification. The latter objective \nis important to the CGIAR portfolio, since in some cases diversification can lead to even \nmore rapid environmental degradation than currently exists. \nExamples of targeted research activities for developing diversity are: JCRAF’s \nwork on small-holder agroforestry systems for the desert margins to alleviate fodder \nshortages and fence in livestock, enhance soil fertility and address problems of \ndesertification; ICRISAT’s work on short-season chickpea improvement and management \nfor post rainy season production in dry and warm marginal environments to diversify \nexisting cropping systems in Asia and East Africa; CIAT’s programme for hillsides in \nLatin America; and ICARDA’s work on low-cost improvement of native pastures in \nmarginal lands and rangelands for increasing productivity of pastoralists and nomadic \nherders; and inter-centre work on developing alternatives to slash and burn agriculture. \nThe Panel emphasized the importance of keeping sustainability concerns uppermost \nin mind as diversification options are explored. In the context of sustainable poverty \nalleviation associated with MAs, the Panel reconfirms TAC’s view, supported by the \nCGIAR members, that strengthening research on NRM and environmental issues is \nneeded in the CGIAR, as is a more explicit linking of this area of research to the Lucerne \n45 \n“vision” of CGIAR contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable food security. \nBecause of their significance in relation to poverty alleviation, we repeat the pertinent \nTAC conclusions regarding NRM here: \n* TAC reaffirms and emphasizes the point: The System should with few exceptions only be doing \nenvironmental and NRM related research that is clearly identified with the impacts of agriculture, \nforestry and fisheries on sustainable poverty alleviation and food security. \n* TAC confirms that research on both aspects of land use impacts - on-site and off-site - are priority \nareas for research in an integrated natural resources management (INRM) research framework such \nas is needed in the System. \n* TAC concludes that once the necessary condition has been met, i.e., the proposed research is \nidentified in a positive way with impacts on sustainable poverty alleviation and food security, then \nadjustments in specific research may logically be made to take into account potential benefits in \nterms of other aspects of environmental improvement and health. Such adjustments should, of \ncourse, consider the cost implications. In fact, much of the research undertaken by the System does \ncontribute to these other goals (even though such research was initiated in the System only because \nof its links to sustainable poverty alleviation and food security through agriculture, forestry and \nfisheries)lg. \nThe CGIAR has traditionally focused on the crop production end of the farming \nsystem. Taking more of a poverty alleviation focus, and realizing the importance to the \npoor of diversifying income generating activities, the Panel suggests that the CGIAR \nneeds to pay more attention to mixed crop-livestock-tree systems. In other words, \nsystems that simultaneously capture different elements of the MA resource potentials need \ngreater attention. For example, integrated systems involving aquaculture, wetland rice, \nlivestock, and agroforestry are likely to contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable \ndevelopment of inland valleys of sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe Panel notes that the work by NGOs has shown that poverty alleviation in MAs \noften is identified with local action. Also poverty alleviation involves diversification of \nactivities and of sources of income and opportunities for improvement (cf. recent speech \nby DG of FAO20). Research related to opportunity access for the poor is frequently \nsituation specific. At the same time, the CGIAR by its nature must focus research on \nthose areas where it is most cost-effective in providing international public goods. \nThe Panel believes that there are a number of potential areas related to poverty \nalleviation that fall within the international public goods category. They include such \nthings as research related to: development of methods and processes for assessment of \npoverty alleviation constraints; poverty processes and the dynamics of poverty (mainly \nlinked to the role of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors); comparative analysis \nof location-specific linkages among environment, technology, agricultural development \nand poverty alleviation; off-farm employment opportunities; and post-harvest technology. \n19 \n20 \nExamples include: biological control undertaken primarily because of the rising costs of chemical \ncontrol with increasing resistance, but benefiting also farmer health and the environment; trees \ngrown on farms for food, wood and forage, but helping to control erosion and, if native species, \nhelping also to conserve biodiversity. \nOp. cit. \n46 \nAny decision on broadening the research agenda along the above lines should only \nbe taken after an examination of the options, potential poverty impacts and alternative \nsuppliers of such research. The Panel recognises that precisely because of the \ninternational public goods requirement, the CGIAR must proceed with caution into an \narea of poverty alleviation which requires a site-specific MA focus. The System can \nonly be a minor part in the total research effort devoted to the types of islsues and topics \narising from this focus. The challenge lies in investing scarce resources in such a way \nas to catalyze further R&D investments by others. Hence the importance placed on \nimplementing Recommendations 2, 3 and 4 once a first approximation has been made of \nthe characteristics of MAs: where are the marginal rural people? why are they poor? \nand the scope and nature of options open to the CGIAR to effect change towards \nsustainable poverty alleviation (Recommendation 1). \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe Panel members wish to express their sincere appreciation to TAC and \nits Secretariat for their cooperation throughout the course of this Study. All CGIAR \nCentres fully cooperated with the Study Panel and the TAC Secretariat during the Study, \nand they deserve our special thanks for this. \nFAO, IFAD and The World Bank provided considerable support to the \nStudy particularly in making available information on land resources, forestry, population \nand poverty. Panel members also visited these and other institutions to discuss key issues \nrelated to marginal lands. These interactions proved extremely valuable and the Panel \nwishes to acknowledge this with thanks - particularly helpful were comments provided by \nNikos Alexandratos of FAO and Pierre Crosson of RFF. \nThe Panel wishes to acknowledge the significant contribution of Dr. Amir \nKassam as Panel Secretary and the excellent efforts of Dr. Filemon Torres and Mr. Jan \nPeter Groenewold, TAC Secretariat Consultants, in the preparation of Annexes II and IV. \nThe Panel expresses its special appreciation to Ms. Ann Drummond of the TAC \nSecretariat, for valuable assistance in the preparation of this report. \nANNEX1 \nTERMS OF REFERENCE \nThe terms of reference for the study are to: \n(1) Examine concepts and definitions for use by the CGIAR: \n(2) \n(3) \nExamine potentials for research gains from inherently marginal lands \n(regardless of production potentials relative to other lands) in terms of: \n(a) the per hectare gains possible on.the individual marginal land types (by \necosystem or region); and (b) the total area of individual marginal land \ntypes on which gains could be applied; (c) the policy gains (e.g., related to \nincentives) that might be derived from research.

The scope of the database was to indicate \norders of magnitude of different land types in the developing regions, i.e. the extent of \nfavourable and less favourable lands for agricultural purposes, the extent of forest and \nwoodlands and of dry areas and the numbers of rural people and rural poor living on \nthem. \n1. Primary Data \nThe primary data used on land area and population was supplied by FAO/Land \nand Water Division. The countries land area by soil classes information was derived \nfrom the digitized FAO Soil Map of the World at a scale of 15 million, overlaid with \nagroclimatic maps. This data was georeferenced to cells of 5 square minutes, an area of \nabout 30 km2 at the Equator. For every country the output was a file with: \nl soil/terrain - 11 classes characterized as follows: \nl- \n2- \n3- \n4- \n5- \n6- \n7- saline/sodic soils: with high salt content/exchangeable sodium saturation; \n8- acid sulphate soils: soils in which sulphidic materials have accumulated; \n9- organic soils/peat soils: composed to more than 50% of organic material; \n10 - no problem soils: no constraints to sustained agricultural production; \n11 - “miscellaneous” lands (mainly water bodies). \nsloping terrain: steeply dissected with slopes in excess of 30 % ; \nshallow soils: with depth limitations within 50 cm of the surface caused by \nthe presence of coherent and hard rock or hard-pans; \npoorly drained soils: waterlogged and/or flooded for a significant part of \nthe year; \ncoarse textured soils: coarse in texture or having gravel, stones, boulders, \nrock outcrops in surface layers or at the surface; \nheavy cracking clays: with high clay content and deep cracks occurring at \nsome point in time in most years (unless irrigated); \ninfertile soils: with deficiencies in major, secondary and minor plant \nnutrients when cultivated; \n0 moisture regime - 16 reference length of growing period (LGP)’ classes in 30 day \nintervals of “rainfed” moisture availability and temperatures that permit plant \ngrowth; \nThe resolution for the files extracted was at 0.1% , i.e., percentage values of the \ntotal surface or population of a country below a tenth of percent per cell were not \nAnnex II - Page 2 \nrecorded during the extraction. This fact can lead to a limited loss of land areas in the \noutput files, especially for large countries. \nh, feature of the soil/land types constraints information is that they are mutually \nexclusive, i.e., these are used in a sieving approach with the sequence of soil \ncharacteristics above. In this way the first land type, sloping, would have all the soils \nwith more than 30% slope in the data irrespective of their further soil characteristics, \nincluding therefore also sandy and/or infertile soils in Be sloping class. The sequence is \nsomewhat arbitrary but geared towards agricultural purposes, i.e., the niost limiting factor \n- or the most. vulnerable aspect with regard to erosion potential - steepness, is excluded \nfirst. The sequence of the soil classes therefore influences the results for soil/terrain types \n1 to 9, whereas the type 10 “no constraint” can be seen as the.output of the sieving and \ntheir values are not affected by the order of sieving., With this method the surface area \ninformation is additive to 100 % . \nThe countries’ population data was estimated by a study team of Santa Barbara \nUniversity in 1989. It was extracted in the same set-up as the terrain/soil data above, and \na country’s cell with land area informatiqn has a corresponding cell with population \ninformation in a second file. The &b-national level population data used by the Santa \nBarbara, University was spread to the corresponding georeferenced land assuming an \nhomogeneous population density across the administrative area. \nCountry values on percentages rural population and rural poor. people were takqn \nfrom data based on UNDP Human Development Report 1994. \n2. Calculation of land type and population values \nCountry summary files were created which contain the information for land areas . \nand population by soil characteristics and LGPs. The approach followed t.o derive from \nthis data a breakdown for different land types and for population is shown graphically in \nFigure II. 1. \nBy combining this data set on soil characteristics and LGPs with a further data \nsource on the extent of forest and woodlands in the countries (FAO Forestry.Statistics \nToday for Tomotiow, 1995), the land area could be grouped into three major categories \n(favoured lands, forest and woodlands, and arid area) to derive marginal algricultural \nlands, the fourth category, as a residue.. First, the favoured lands were defined as soil \ntype 10 (no constraints) with LGPs above 75 days, taken as a lower limit Iof rainfed \ncultivation and grazing, and significant .forest and woodland growth. Assuming an even \ndistribution of forests and woodlands in the countries, these favoured la& were reduced \nby theecountries’ share of forests and woodlands and the balance are the favoured \nagricultural lands (FAL). Arid areas (LGPs below 30 days) and the countries’ residue of \nforest and woodlands are subtracted from the data for the other soil characteristics to \ndetermine the extent of marginal ‘a@icultural lands (MAL). These MALs are the land \nareas above 30 days of LGP on sloping, shallow, coarse, heavy cracking, etc., lands, but \nexclude the forest and woodlands and the arid areas of the country. They would, \nhowever, include grazing lands. The results of this assessment at regional. level are given \nin Table 2.3. \nAnnex II - Page 3 \nTo show the importance of irrigation in arid regions of the world a further column \nwas inserted in Table 2.3. The values show the extent of irrigated areas in arid lands. \nThis data is an estimate for country level irrigated lands (data from TAC 1992, Priorities \nand Strategies database) which was overlaid with LGP information. The physical area of \nthe irrigated lands would be contained in the values for the arid lands, whereas the land \ntype itself would be classified in the category favoured agricultural lands. \nRural population data is shown at the regional aggregate level in Table 2.4. The \nprocedure applied stemmed from the above classification for the land areas but was \nessentially simpler and, unfortunately, less refined. The population values on FAL were \nderived as the sum of the population figures for the favoured lands (soil class 10 with no \nsoil constraints and with LGP > 75 days), and the remainder was set as the country rural \npopulation on “other” land types, including marginal agricultural, forests and woodlands \nand desert areas. The information for forest cover could & be used to differentiate \npeople living on good lands between agriculture and forestry, in this case the value was \nused as an estimate for rural population on prime lands only. Furthermore, country \nvalues for rural poverty (based on UNDP data) were used as factors to derive an estimate \nof rural poor living on less favoured lands. \nFigure 11.1: Organization of Database of Land Types for an Example Country \nLGP \n1 so1L CLPSES 2 3 9 10 % *................ \n. . . . . \n. . . . . \n. . . . . . . \n. . . . . . . \ni:::::o . \n0 . . . . . 0 \n1212125 Land area (a: \n0.2% . . . . . \nDATA/CALCULATIONS PERFORMED \nl-OTAL LAND AREA 1212125 \nTAVOURED LANDS ;; 344576 \nTOREST WOODLAND COVER (INPUT VALUE) Cc) 34.6% \nJOREST/WOODLAND ON FAVOURED LAND @xc) 119370 \nTAVOURED AGRICULTURAL LANDS (b - bxc) 225206 \n4RID LANDS (4 122190 \nHARGINAL AGRICULTURAL LANDS (a-(b-bxc)-(axe)-d) 444819 \nANNEX III \nCONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR \nANALYZING RESEARCH INVESTMENTS IN POVERTY \nALLEVIATION IN A MARGINAL LANDS CONTEXT \nThe focus of this study is on the role of the CGIAR in research related to \n“marginal lands.” However, TAC has made it clear that the System should not be \ninvesting in research on marginal lands just because they currently are considered low \npotential areas for agriculture. Thus, as stated in the proposal for the study, “TAC \nfavours allocating resources such that the balance between high and low potential \nenvironments emerges from the concern with poverty alleviation and resource \nconservation, rather than being introduced a priori.” \nTAC’s views regarding research priorities for marginal lands are based on the \npremise that a balance of effort is required between the marginal lands and the non \nmarginal or “high potential lands”. It is not an issue of research investments in one land \ntype against the other, but rather of assessing research priorities against the criteria of \npoverty alleviation, protection of the environment (sustainability) and efficiency \n(productivity enhancement). As stated in the Lucerne Declaration, the CGIAR research \nagenda should address problems of the poor in both less endowed and high potential \nareas, \nFrom an agricultural productivity and production perspective, a further \nimplication of the focus on poverty alleviation is that the CGIAR is concerned not only \nwith the per hectare potential of different classes of land (i.e., their maximum potential \nlevel of production), but also with the scope for overall improvement in poverty \nreduction and food security through its R & D. That means that the overall levels of \nproduction that can be achieved on the farmers’ fields are directly relevant to investment \ndecisions in research. We can think of those overall levels as being a product of the \naverage attainable sustainable yield increase per hectare (Y) and the area on which that \nyield increase can be achieved (A). Thus, (A x Y) becomes the relevant focus. \nThus, it may be that one million ha. of land (A) with moderate productivity, with \na feasible improvement of say 0.5 tonne per hectare (Y), is a better prospect for future R \n& D investment than a smaller area of say 50,000 ha. of already improved high \nproductivity irrigated land, where the product of A x Y is lower. In other words, in this \ncase, additional CGIAR research related to marginal lands can make a greater difference \nthan spending the resources in a favored area. \nWe can put these thoughts in more expanded form as follows: \nTargeting research investment to a given area of marginal land, A. \nIn a sustainable poverty alleviation context, but with a focus on production of \nAnnex III - Page 2 \ncrops (food, livestock, forest, or fish), the contribution of CGIAR research ‘5” to poverty \nalleviation can be formulated conceptually as follows: \n((4 ) X (Yi)} X (Ipop) + OFi + Si = Gi (1) \nwhere, \nAi = size of area that benefits from CGIAR research i. \nyi = average sustainable net income (or net benefit or use value) increase per \nunit area due to CGIAR research i (where “sustainable” incorporates the \nthe environmental protection constraint; and “net” income means benefits \nactually captured by the farmer net of the associated costs of achieving the \nbenefits; the benefits can come from policy gains as well ars productivity \nincreases; values appropriately adjusted to present value (PV) terms \nthrough use of appropriate discount rate). \n5 oP = index for number of poor people gaining or benefiting from (A x Yi), \nweighted for: (a) degree of poverty affected (e.g., proportion “poorest of \nthe poor”); and (b) extent to which those other than the producers of (A x \nYi) gain from lower prices due to (A x Yi); \nOFi = measure of net gain from off-farm activity in A due to research i, \nweighted for the extent to which poor people benefit from the gain (again, \nin PV terms); \nsi = spillover impacts, or externality impacts (in PV terms); \nGi = measure of gain from research i, (which, given the left side of the \nequation, is a measure of production increase, or net income increase, due \nto the research, weighted for a poverty alleviation objective); \nAs mentioned, this formulation considers poverty alleviation impacts with a focus \non agricultural, forestry, or Jisheries production. If we limit consideration to marginal \nagricultural lands (MAL), then A of course would reflect the particular MAL area being \nconsidered. However, as discussed below, the formulation can be used to look (at least \nconceptually) at all types of land (both FAL and MAL). \nIn this format, we are asking the following question: given the potential area for \ncrop x or y, what kind of per hectare income increase could be generated. by research \nrelated to this crop? (Obviously, in order to identify a relevant A, we have to have \nsome particular crop(s) in mind.) \nTargeting research investment to a given marginalized population \nWe also can change the formulation to make the primary objective be poverty \nalleviation. This then would be the primary determinant of Gi for a given CGIAR \nresearch investment, i, in terms of a given target population of poor or marginalized \npeople (some farmers, some perhaps not). If one takes a poor people focus and looks \nat research investment from that perspective, then the following formulation might be \nmore appropriate: \nAnnex III - Page 3 \n(poPi x yPoP ) + Si = Gi \nwhere, \nPOpi = population of poor people targeted by research i; (the population could be \nassociated with any number of characteristics that relate to poverty) \nyPoP = average per capita net benefit flow gain for POpi due to CGIAR research \ni (such research could be focused on crops and other things that could \ngenerate benefits) \nSi and Gi = as before, except G now is expressed in terms of poverty alleviation \nmeasure; \nGiven the above formulations, which apply equally to “marginal” as to “non- \nmarginal” lands, there is no necessary reason why, for a given (Ai x Yi) or (POpi x \nY .,), the CGIAR should be interested more in marginal vs. non-marginal lands, except \ni the marginaZ lands (defined by A) have proportionally Zarger populations of poor f” \npeople who can gain from changes due to the research’, i.e., the Ipop that applies is \nhigher; or POpi for the marginal lands is higher, other things being equal. These $Op and \nPOpi conditions define “marginal areas” (MA) used in the study regardless of whether \nthe lands on which this population lives is biophysically marginal or favoured. \nFrom a strategic public investment point of view, maximizing returns (G) per \nunit of scarce CGIAR resource ($R) may be regarded as a rational criterion for \nallocation; (where $R is the amount invested to get the response G). Thus, we have a \nmeasure of research investment eficiency as follows: \nResearch investment efficiency. This could be measured by Gi per $ of CGIAR \nand associated research expenditure, when both are appropriately discounted to \nthe same point in time: \n(Gi/$Ri) = research efficiency; (3) \nWe would want to find that set of research opportunities that maximizes G for \nthe research budget (i.e., we would seek to maximize the net present worth of the \nresearch investment). \nWe can further modify this formulation to look at the social cost-efictiveness of \nresearch investments - which should be the ultimate objective sought, once we have \neliminated all those potential research investments that have Gi < $R. \nAlso, aside from this question of research efficiency, there is a question of distribution of benefits. This is \ntaken into account by the equation above through Ipop and the discount rate used. \nAnnex III - Page 4 \nSocial cost-effectiveness or “impact”. (Gi/$Ri) only considers the: efficiency \nelement, i.e., production of the research results. The real aim is to get research in place \nin the farmer’s fields or in the forest or on the grazing lands. Thus, we need to \nintroduce $Ei, or the extension and transfer costs, to come out with an array of \nopportunities ordered on the basis of: \nGi/($%+$Ei) (4) \nAdding $E to the equation assumes that the CGIAR is interested in research \napplied on the ground as an ultimate test of success - the $E may not come from the \nCGIAR, but has to be considered, since it is a necessary cost of getting research in use. \nThis also raises a question on the need for research into institutional determinants of $E. \nFinally, we also have the strategic question of equity, or distribution of benefits, \nas a criterion for allocation. If the calculations of Gi in relation to $R and $E do not \nproduce results that are acceptable, then the decision-makers need to go back and \ndiscuss and possibly readjust Ipop or the discount rate! \nThe Panel puts forth the above formulation only as an annex, since it represents \nonly the beginning thinking for a broader discussion of priority setting. However, the \nPanel felt it worth including in its report, since it does provide a conceptual perspective \non the differences and similarities that exist when one focuses on a land/productivity \nmeasure of research return versus a poverty alleviation measure. \nANNEX IV \nCURRENT CGIAR ACTIVITIES \nAs part of the Study a desk analysis of current allocation of CGIAR research \nresources to the different land types identified in Annex II was undertaken. In addition to \nestimating total research investments in the different agricultural quadrants (i.e., I to IV), the \nanalysis was also expected to identify allocation patterns among the 12 CGIAR activity \ncategories across land types, if any. \nAvailable information on research expenditures by projects funded by the CGIAR \nSystem is very rarely presented in terms of targeted “land domains”. Actually, a brief \ncharacterisation of the natural resource base on which projects focus their activities is not a \ndescriptor in the standard format used for the 1997 compilation of CGIAR Research-Project \nDetails (1997 R-PD). As a consequence, the exercise was run in two phases. The first \nsought to elicit from the CGIAR Centres information on project agroecological targets, in \nterms of relevant moisture zones, as characterized by length of growing period (LGP), and \nsoil classes (SCs), and on activity patterns across land targets. The second phase attempted \nto re-calculate project resource allocations in relation to the identified land types, as well as \nto assess their stated poverty alleviation focus in terms of objectives, outputs and \nbeneficiaries. \n1. Methodology \nProject information was taken from the CGIAR 1997 R-PD, ,Centres’ 1997 \nProgramme Plans and Funding Requirements (PP&FRs) and Medium Term Plans (MTPs). \nICLARM, IPGRI and ISNAR and most of IFPRI’s projects were not included in the analysis. \nData was used to estimate project resource allocation to moisture zones - as represented by \nLGPs - and research activities within six geographical regions. Among-region estimates \nfollowed Regional Expenditures in Table 3 of the PP&FRs, while LGP estimates were based \non the FAO’s agro-ecological zones information for the different regions. Activity shares \nwere taken from “standards” presented in Table la of the PP&FRs. \nEstimates of resources allocated to CGIAR activities within regional LGPs were then \nsubmitted to the corresponding Centres for their verification. They covered 279 projects out \nof a total of 374 projects endorsed for 1997, accounting for 80% of the total CGIAR budget. \nResources allocated to LGPs within regions were reviewed by most Centres, but only one \nprovided information on soil domains. None indicated changes in the standard share of \nactivities when the project target moved across different land types. \nIn the second phase research expenditures were allocated to land types (quadrants). \nThe basic assumption was that Centres allocate their resources in proportion to the \nimportance of the area and land use covered by SCs within regions and LGPs in which they \noperate. Project budgets were then subjected to the following allocation process: \nl first, among regions and LGPs, in correspondence with resources allocated by \nCentres to LGPs within regions; \nAnnex IV - Page 2 \na second, among land types within LGPs (Table l), in proportion to soil classes \n- which were grouped as soils with no physical constraints (No. lo), with high \nproduction potential (Nos. 3-6), and those with low potential (Nos. l-2 & 7-9) \nassuming no major land development to improve land quality; \n0 third, between land types I and II, according to LGP-specific proportions of \n. lands under QI’ and QII in relevant countries of the region. \nII Table 1: Rules to Allocate Research Resources to Land Types \nMoisture \nEnvironment \nIrrigation \nLGP 75-120 days \nLGP > 120 days \nQ I/Q II \nQIII Q III QN \nQ I/Q II Q III Q IV \nAn unbiased application of this method requires that the actual soil classes in the project land \nareas are known. Unfortunately, as no information could be provided by Centres on the project soil \ndomains, we were compelled to apply the proportions among SCs within LGPs from the FAO/Land \nand Water Division database. As these are the same as those used to calculate land shares among \nquadrants in Annex II, proportions of land types (quadrants) and estimated resource allocations are \nbound to be correlated. \n2. Results \nTable 2 shows how CGIAR resources are being allocated across land types within the six \ngeographical regions. Tentative shares are based on estimates of resources allocated by each of 279 \nprojects to the agroecological focus(i) of their activities. \nTable 2: SHARE OF CGIAR-WIDE PROJECT RESOURCES AMONG LAND TYPES \nWITFIIN REGIONS (as percentages of total within region) \nLand Types (Quadrants) \nRegions I II III IV Globally \nE&S-AFRICA 26.2% 57.4% 16.3% 18.1% \nW&C-AFRICA 29.9% 57.2% 12.9% 23.1% \nS&SE-ASIA 27.5% 14.6% 34.1% 23.7% 32.3% \nWANA 21.2% 25.3% 27.0% 26.4% 11.0% \nLAC (MesoAmerica) 32.5% 14.1% 27.7% 25.7% 4.7% \nLAC (SouthAmerica) 12.6% 15.8% 59.1% 12.4% 10.8% \nGLOBALLY 26.0% 10.0% 45.0% 19.0% 100.0% \nAnnex IV - Page 3 \nNotwithstanding the methodological reservations, shares indicate that about one third \nof CGIAR resources are invested on the favourable agricultural lands of Qs I and II (FALs), \nand the remaining two thirds to the so-called marginal agricultural lands (MALs) of Qs III \n(45 %) and IV (19 %). This means that 70 % of the resources allocated to MALs are directed \ntowards those MALs that have a high productivity potential I if the biophysical and \nsocioeconomic constraints are removed. Considering, however, that Q III MALs in which \nCentres operate include productive areas such as the cracking “black cotton” soils of India \nand eastern Africa, the poorly drained “inland valleys” of West Africa and the infertile \n“Cerrados” of Brazil, it could also be concluded that three quarters of CGIAR resources are \nbeing applied to increase the sustainable productivity of lands with high agroecological \npotential (Qs I-II, and tracts of Q III). \nTable 3 presents regional estimates on how resources are shared among CGIAR \nresearch activities within favourable and marginal lands. Given the opportunities for \nCGIAR’s research on the marginalized poor identified in Chapter 4, the 12 categories are \nclustered into four ad-hoc groups of activities addressing such opportunities. \nActivities on Biodiversity Conservation and Enhancement (grouping Act. 1 &z 7) \nrepresent resources allocated to improve biological alternatives, while those under Sustainable \nProduction Systems (grouping Act. 2-6) address requirements for “intensification through \ndiversification”. Policy activities (Act. 8) deal with institutional constraints, Collaboration \nwith NARS (Act. 9-12) contribute to the requirement for new partnership mechanisms \nadvocated in recommendations 3-4. \nAs no information was provided by the Centres to indicate whether proportions among \nactivities changed with regions and LGPs, estimates in Table 3 are based on the standard \nvalues across land types. This would explain why global activity shares remain essentially \nthe same between land types. Should proportions be different at operational levels, shares \nof projects covering more than one agroecology would not represent actual resource \nallocation. \nThe same picture appears to emerge from the regional data, the exception being that \nof WANA. Estimates for this region show a substantial increase in Biodiversity and \nCollaborative activities for research on MALs, while activities on Sustainable Systems and \nPolicy decrease. Despite this, reflections on the preliminary analysis would suggest that \ncurrent activity categories may not be sensitive enough to indicate actual resources allocated \nto alleviating constraints affecting poverty processes. Thus, activities in biodiversity \nenhancement to improve nutrient utilization by plants could be aimed at either nutrient-rich \n(FALs) or nutrient-poor lands (MALs). In the same vein, Sustainable Systems research \ncould be aimed at increasing the long-term economic efficiency of monocropping enterprises, \nor at identifying opportunities for diversified systems. \nAn assessment of CGIAR resources focused on the marginalized rural poor would \nrequire, therefore, information on the extent to which projects are explicitly targeted at \npoverty alleviation in MALs. An examination of the 374 projects endorsed for 1997 shows \nthat only 92 projects appear to be targeted directly at poverty alleviation on MALs (25 %), \nand 37 of them are partially targeted (10%). Of the remaining 245 projects, 27 are targeted \nat poverty alleviation in FALs (7 %), and 218 projects are not explicitly targeted to poverty \nalleviation (58 %). \nAnnex IV - Page 4 \nTable 3: REGIONAL CGIAR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ACROSS LAND TYPES (as \npercentage of totals within region) \nCGIAR Research Activities \nBiodiversity Sustainable \nConservation/ Production Collaboratio:n \nEnhancement Systems Policy with NARS \nLand Types (Act. 1 & 7) (Act. 2-6) (Act. 8) (Act. 9-12) GLOBAL \nAFRICA \nQs I&II - FALs 29 45 9 17 34 \nQs III&IV - MALs 30 46 7 17 46 \nASIA \nQs I&II - FALs 34 46 8 12 38 \nQs III&IV - MALs 35 42 9 14 29 \nWANA \nQs I&II - FALs 23 53 11 13 14 \nQs III&IV - MALs 30 42 4 25 9 \nLAC \nQs I&II - FALs 28 41 17 14 14 _ \nQs III&IV - MALs 29 47 8 16 16 \nGLOBAL \nQs I&II - FALs 30 46 10 14 100 \nQs III&IV - MALs 31 44 8 17 100 \nANNEXV \nCOMPOSITION OF THE STUDY TEAM \nDr. Michael Nelson (New Zealand) \nCasilla 209- 12 \nSantiago \nChile. \nMembers: \nDr. Hans Gregersen (USA) \nCollege of Forestry \nUniversity of Minnesota \nRoom 110, Green Hall \n1536 N.

With the aim of achieving greater uniformity of terminology, the Report \npresented a six-celled matrix for evaluating land-related issues. This paper takes the \nprinciples, which the Marginal Lands Study adopted for its examination of the relation \nbetween marginal lands and rural poverty, and develops them as a conceptual framework for \nmore-general use by the CGIAR in its priority setting. Land is defined as an area of the \nearth’s surface which comprises the major biophysical attributes that influence land use, \nincluding the atmosphere, soil, geology and hydrology, plant and animal populations, and the \nresults of past and present human activity such as terracing, drainage and irrigation. \nThe CGIAR has adopted the practice of setting its priorities and strategies according \nto the poverty weighted values of commodities and sectors, with allowance for important \nmodifying factors such as those that influence the probability of success in research2. These \nprinciples could also be applied to prioritizing the System’s work on different types of land. \nAlston, Norton and Pardey have listed four efficiency criteria for estimating the expected \nbenefits from commodity research programs: current value of production, maximum yield \nincrease (or decrease prevented) if the research were successful, probability of research \nsuccess, and the likely rate and extent of adoption of its results. The framework outlined in \nthis paper would assist in assigning values to these criteria, so that potential benefits could be \nestimated for research on different categories of land. Information about the likely costs of \nsuch research would be needed for a prospective cost/benefit analysis. \n1. Background \nIn the Marginal Lands Report, the six-celled matrix was defined by the present value \nof land use on one axis, and on the other, the potential for enhancement of production through \nresearch. Three levels of present use value were identified: \nl high present use value - favoured agricultural lands, \nl low present use value - marginal agricultural lands, \nl lands at low or zero intensity of use. \nTwo levels of potential to expand production based on research were identified, high \nand low. Figure 1 reproduces the table that was presented in the Marginal Lands Report. \n’ TAC (1997a). Report on the Study of CGIAR Research Priorities for Marginal Lands.

Issues in the Development of a Generalized Framework \nIn developing these principles for more-general use by the CGIAR, TAC recognized \nthe follo@ng issues. Firstly, in the real world there tends to be continuous variation from \nzero to high in both the present value of land use and the potential to enhance its productivity \nthrough research. While the six quadrants* are helpful in visualizing the characteristics of the \ndifferent types of land, it is a matter of choice as to where the dividing lines are drawn. \nSecondly, the Marginal Lands Report defined the potential to expand production in \nterms of research only. While research is the primary interest of the CGIAR, there are \narguments for preceding the analysis of research priorities with a review of the potential \nbenefits from investments of all kinds. It may be that for well-known socioeconomic reasons \n(not needing further research) existing technologies are not being used to enhance the value \nof production. Alternatively, further research may be required to find out why apparently \nsuitable technologies are not being used. \nGenerally, two main sets of factors determine the scope for enhancement of value of \nland use through investment. Firstly, there are the biophysical attributes of soil, climate and \nterrain. Man-made physical capital, such as the provision of irrigation water and the terracing \nof steep slopes, also could be included here. Secondly, there are socioeconomic elements \nassociated with (a) the creation, dissemination and utilization of knowledge, (b) access to \ninputs, markets and credit facilities, (c) output/input ratios, and (d) a group of motivational \nfactors determined to a large extent by the incentives created by society and its economic, \ncultural and other institutions. \nIn other words, and as developed more fully in the TAC Marginal Lands study, the \nactual realization of the potential for improvements in production or productivity depends on \npeople having control over land (use rights), and specifically on their knowledge of what can \nand needs to be done; their access to the resources required to implement what needs to be \ndone; and their incentives to do what needs to be done. \nThirdly, the point needs to be made that the present productive value of any particular \narea of land depends greatly on what it is used for. Land that is too dry for cropping may be \nvery profitable for grazing ruminant livestock. In more humid climates., terrain that is \nunsuitable for cultivation of annual crops may be well suited to perennial tree crops and \nforests. So there will be a different matrix for each type of land use in agriculture and \nforestry. \nFourthly, it must be recognized that in practice the productivity of agricultural land \ncan also be reduced. The use of land for agriculture sets in train a set of potentially degrading \nprocesses (a downward movement in Figure l), which have to be countered i,f value is not to \nbe lost. While investment in research is usually thought of in the context of enhancing land \nvalue, it can also serve to prevent or reduce potential loss of value. \nDuring the past 150 years, agricultural research has continually expanded the \nopportunities for productivity enhancement, often far beyond the intrinsic value of the land \nfor agriculture when it was first used for that purpose. However, the possibility that these \nl The terminology of the Marginal Lands Report has been adopted here. \n3 \ninherent degrading processes will reduce the productive value of agricultural land has been of \nincreasing global concern recently, under the rubric of sustainability. \n, \nFinally, there does not appear to be any strict logical relationship between lands at low \nor zero present intensity of use (for any particular form of agriculture or forestry) in quadrants \n5 and 6 of Figure 1 and those in the other four quadrants of the matrix. Land that is available \nfor future development, say grazing land with good potential for grain cropping, could in \ntheory translate into any of quadrants 1 to 4 when developed for that purpose. \n3. The Proposed Framework \nWith these issues in mind, TAC proposes that the Group adopt a modified version of \nthe scheme described in the Marginal Lands Report. The priority of any particular category \nof land would be rated by plotting its present productivity per unit area of land, against the \npotential for change through investment in research. This is equivalent to using quadrants 1 \nto 4 of Figure 1 without the dividing lines, and reversing the direction of the axis for potential \nto expand production. Another important change would be to define the X axis to include \nprevention of degradation, rather than enhancement of production only, as in Figure 1. This \nis consistent with sustainability reasoning, by allowing for investment in research that \nforestalls loss of productivity through land degradation. Land that is awaiting development \nwould be classified into a single separate category, noting that in practice there is likely to be \na spectrum of feasibility, from land that is available immediately using existing technologies \nand under existing investment conditions, through to land that would become attractive for \ndevelopment only after the discovery of new technologies or under the pressure of increased \ndemand. Having a separate category of land awaiting development, instead of quadrants 5 \nand 6 set in a fixed relationship to the rest of Figure 1, allows newly-developed land to fall \nanywhere in the graph of productivity against potential returns from research. \nThe location of any particular land type within the framework of Figure 2 is very \nlikely to change with time. Implementation of improved technologies will move land from \nthe bottom right of the figure towards the top left of it. Thus, the adoption of green \nrevolution technologies in Asia over the period 1961 to 1990 lifted average rice yields from \n1800 to 3700 kilograms a hectare4. In the process, the potential benefit from further \ninvestment in conventional agricultural research was sharply reduced, at least for those lands \nusing the new technologies at levels close to their economic optima, and with the existing \nstock of basic knowledge. Some significant scientific breakthrough, say in yield potential or \nin resistance to pests, diseases or soil constraints, was then needed to move the most \nproductive green revolution rice lands back towards the right hand side of Figure 2. \nMoreover, research to prevent degradation of such high-yielding lands may then have offered \na more attractive investment than yield enhancing research. Generally, unchecked \ndegradation will move lands ‘downwards in Figure 2, to the right for those kinds of \ndegradation with good potential for reversal through research, to the left for those lacking that \npotential. \n4 ’ Plucknett, D L (1993) Science and Agricultural Transformation. IFPRI Lecture Series No. 1. \n4 \n4. How the Framework Might Be Used \nIn order to use the efficiency criteria described by Alston, Norton (and Pardey, it is \nnecessary to know the total area of each category of land as well as its current productivity \nper unit area. This permits current values of production to be calculated. The other three \ncriteria, the maximum increase (or decrease forestalled) if the research were successful, the \nprobability of such success, and the likely rate and extent of adoption, can all be factored into \nthe potential benefits achievable through investment in research. \nOne of the greatest difficulties in attempting to set agricultural research priorities \nobjectively is the lack of reliable global data sets. In the case of agricultural land, reasonable \ndata are likely to be obtainable on area and current productivity, but at present the potential \nchange achievable through research can be estimated only on the basis of well informed \njudgement. Because of deficiencies in existing knowledge of values for the erfficiency criteria \nin research, in most cases it may be possible to agree only on the relative rankings of different \ntypes of land on the X axis, without it being possible to assign any exact values to them. \nMembers of the CGIAR may find most value in assessments of the relative priorities \nof research on different classes of land within the mandated region of a single centre and the \nnational systems with which it works. Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) would be one obvious \nbasis of comparison. Another would be on political boundaries, because of the powerful \ninfluence of social and institutional factors on the implementation of new agricultural \ntechnologies. Also, the data permit poverty weightings to be made only for political \nboundaries at present. \nThe following paragraphs offer some very preliminary suggestions of questions that \nwould be worth asking about the priorities of different land types for prod-uction of annual \ngrain crops, ruminant livestock and forests. \nIn the case of croplands, one of the triggers for TAC’s review of the marginal lands \nissue was the perception by some people that they warranted a higher priority in CGIAR \nresearch than they had hitherto received. It is true that the major impact of green revolution \ncropping technologies has been in irrigated areas, and the possibility that some categories of \nrainfed land may now offer a higher rate of return on research deserves serious consideration. \nThe highest immediate priority may be for socioeconomic research to under;stand better why \nthe biophysical components of the very successful green revolution technologies have not \nbeen used to a greater extent on rainfed cropping lands. Government policies may be part of \nthe answer. In developing countries, irrigated agriculture has generally been lsubsidized much \nmore heavily than rainfed agriculture. \nThe case for additional CGIAR crop and livestock research ‘to enhance the \nproductivity of marginal lands is questionable. The information available to the Marginal \nLands Review indicated that they had certainly not been neglected by the centres. Indeed, the \nReport argues strongly that the primary problem of poor people in low potential croplands is \nnot technology as such, but deficiencies in the prevailing institutio:nal and policy \narrangements. \nConcern about land degradation seems to have motivated much of the external interest \nin CGIAR research priorities for grazing lands used for ruminant livestock production. \nAlthough the very large area of grazed rangeland that is too dry for cropping or for growing \nimproved forages does not support a large proportion of developing-country livestock or \npeople, its research priority versus that of higher rainfall regions needs to be assessed \nobjectively. Despite the pathetic appearance of arid grazing lands during prolonged drought, \nthey can recover rapidly in subsequent periods of normal rainfall’. In the current state of \nknowledge, most experts would assess them as offering relatively low potential rates of return \nfrom investment in agricultural research. \nThere is a significant area of land in sub-Saharan Africa awaiting development for \nruminant livestock production, if the constraint of trypanosomiasis could be overcome. This \ncategory of land has, by implication, received a high priority in CGIAR investments. The \nchief question mark over current biotechnical research on trypanosomiasis has attached to its \nprobability of success, not the priority of the associated land type. \nThere has been very limited interest in comparisons of land types for ,tropical forestry. \nA far more important question is that of research priorities amongst alternative forms of land \nuse within the same land type, notably in the remaining forests of the humid tropical \nlowlands. The framework of Figure 2 could be adapted to this purpose. Much of the land \nthat was deforested in South America during the last two decades went into ruminant \nlivestock production, whereas cropping and logging were the major causes of deforestation in \nAsia and sub-Saharan Af?ica6. The critical issue of prioritization is to estimate relative rates \nof return from research on the use of lowland rainforest for conservation of biodiversity plus \nproduction of non-wood products,- versus that from research on the use of the same land for \nlogging, for forestry plantations, for tree crops (agroforestry), or for annual food crops. The \nchallenge is to find common units of measurement that allow conservation of biodiversity to \nbe plotted along with subsistence-and ollars on the value axis. \n. \n5 de Haan, C, Steinfeld, H and Blackbum H (1997).

Definition, in each process, is driven largely by the perceptions of those \nanalyzing the phenomena. Each group brings its own strong perceptions to bear. The lack \nof clear conceptualization, the observed heterogeneity and the diverse perceptions of \nthose attempting the exercise complicate attempts at measurement. Statistical problems in \nthe available measurements of each phenomenon, arising, among other things, from lack \nof representativeness, reduce the confidence that can be attached to extrapolations. \nEvaluating cause and effect with confidence implies, ideally, being able to observe the \nprocesses at different points in time for a large number of well-defined and relatively \nhomogeneous situations. Such comparable observations are generally not available. In \nmost cases the lack of adequate data and the complexity of the relationships that need to \nbe modeled seriously limits rigorous empirical verification. Since a fuller understanding \nof the complex interaction of the two processes naturally leads on from a more \ncomprehensive understanding of the individual processes, it too suffers from all the \nproblems impeding a deeper understanding of each. \nThe aggregate information available is not very useful for making judgments about \npoverty and land degradation. Evidence from the few available micro-level studies is \nmixed and often contradictory. IMost of the available technical literature relates to the \ncontroversy regarding the reasons for the adoption (or non-adoption) of conservation \npractices. This literature does not specifically address the behavior of the poor except \nthrough the cost implications of different conservation technologies and the incentive \nstructures that influence adoption. \nTheoretical considerations are often cited as to why the poor can be expected to behave in \nways that are land degrading. However, these considerations can generally apply just as \nwell to the non-poor and can be explained by overall low levels of development. The \npressures arising out of the processes of economic development that might induce people \nto degrade the land have be classified, in the literature, as those related to: increases in \npopulation; declines in common property resources; interest rate changes; and technology \ntransfers. \nHowever, the literature also includes considerable theoretical and empirical evidence that \nindicates that the response to population pressures and market forces, in the long run, is \nan endogenous process of adaptation towards sustainable behavior. \nAt the household level much more research, in a variety of settings over a reasonable \nlength of time, is needed for a fuller understanding of decision-making processes, \nespecially in terms of the relationship with land. Such research should ideally be built on \ndetailed household-level longitudinal socioeconomic surveys with specific land use and \niv \nquality assessment modules. Only then will it be possible to differentiate behavior by \npoverty status. The CGIAR is well placed to support such research. \nThe CGIAR can also facilitate much greater interaction between the difYerent “actors” to \nbring realism where uninformed perceptions prevail, especially in the area of land \ndegradation. Such interactions will lend much greater realism to the understanding of \nissues that have important implications for the present and future of humankind. These \ninteractions shou!d naturally build on existing understanding, so as not to reinvent the \nwheel. The broad research agenda on poverty and land degradation can only be well \ndefined after a reasonable period over which such understanding is established. \nSuch research can only enhance the efforts within the CGIAR System on integrating \ncommodity research with natural-resource management considerations. ‘This emphasis is \nproperly placed and relevant. The CGIAR is a key forum for addressing the global dearth \nof knowledge about the implictitions of land degradation. A research agenda is needed \nthat makes good use of the available information in order to better focus on poverty \nalleviation through the integration of commodity and natural-resource management \nresearch. Its relevance must be enhanced through the collection and use of more \ndisaggregated information. \nI \nRural Poverty and Land Degradation: \nA Reality Check for the CGIAR \n1. . BACKGROUND \nBased on an in-depth evaluation of available information, the study on CGIAR Research \nPriorities on lMargina1 Lands’ concludes that neither the global and regional \nquantification of marginal land areas (based on biophysical data) nor the assessment of \nCGIAR projects and expenditures assignable to these various land areas are relevant to \nthe CGIAR’s decision on strategy for poverty alleviation. The report states that the \nconcept of “marginal areas” (MA) is more relevant.2 These are areas where “there are \nconcentrations of marginal rural people and where the definition of geographic area \nwould derive from a set of relatively homogeneous variables deemed to generate rural \npoverty. Biophysical characteristics would be one element in the equation” [Nelson et al. \n(1997)]. It thus put rural poverty at the center of the stage3. \nWithin this overall sharper focus on the need to understand more fklly the causes and \nconsequences of rural poverty with a view to identifying the options open to the System \nfor addressing it; the report stated that “there is [also] a need to improve our \nunderstanding of land and water degradation processes.4 There appears to be little hard \n’ This study had started with the “four tenets of conventional wisdom,” namely: 1)Marginal lands are \ndefined in biophysical terms which establish them as: having low inherent productivity for agriculture; \nbeing susceptible to degradation; and involving high risks for agricultural production; 2)They support a \nhigh proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor; 3) The combination of.fiagility and \nhigh density of poor people who place a premium on current consumption (resulting in over-exploitation of \nnatural resources) is leading to accelerated erosion or vegetation destruction; the consequence is a \ndownward spiral of poverty and resource degradation with significant negative externalities; and, 4)The \nimpact of CGIAR research on agricultural productivity increase, environmental protection and above all, \npoverty alleviation has been limited in these areas pelson et al. (1997)]. \n’ Lack of comfort with the definition of marginal areas purely in terms of climate. soils and terrain was \nobvious for several years. For example, Crosson and Anderson (1993) had suggested an alternative \ndefinition based on productivity potential. Their discomfort had also extended to the allocation of research \nresources for such areas. From a purely economic point of view these authors had pointed out that research \nresources should only be allocated to marginal areas when concerns with equity in the distribution of \nproductive opportunities outweighs productivity gains as the criterion for research focus amongst areas. \nThis is basically a political choice and to the extent that cost free migration is an alternative, equity might \nbe much better served by focusing on the areas with more productive potential and encouraging non \nagricultural activities in the less favored ones. Focusing on less favored areas may not be the most cost \neffective way to promote equity. \n‘The report concludes that the assessment of the appropriate balance between CGIAR research investment \ntargeted to hiA and to non-MA could only follow from a clarification of where marginal people are \nlocated, why they are marginal and the options open to the System for addressing poverty in the MA. \n4 The widespread reports of land degradation in Africa; soil erosion on sloping lands in South Asia; and the \nextensive deforestation of agricultural landscapes in formerly forested parts of South Asia and Ethiopia \nhave brought an increased focus on issues of natural resource management in agriculture [Scherr and \n2 \nevidence linking the poor, in contrast to the non-poor, to accelerated resource \ndegradation. Degradation processes need to be understood and linked to poverty \nprocesses” melson et al. (1997)]. \nBy highlighting the lack of rigorous evidence and calling for a greater understanding of \nthe interaction of the two processes, the Marginal Lands Study has called into question \nthe strong perception that poverty is both a consequence as well as a cause of resource \ndegradation.’ This perception is strongly evident in the writings of the multilateral \ndevelopment agencies such as the World Bank6 and the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development7 (IFAD). \nThe present study is a first step towards addressing the concerns raised by Nelson et al. \n(1997) with regard to poverty and land degradation. In reviewing the available literature \non rural poverty and land degradation and evaluating the implications of the current state \nof knowledge for priority setting in the CGIAR System; an attempt is made to look \nbeyond the generally-held perceptions of poverty and land degradation processes. Such \nan effort is inherently fraught with all the problems that a study of the interaction of two \ncomplex and diverse processes is bound to face. These problems are further compounded \nby the fact that the understanding of these processes is still limited and shrouded in \nyadav (1995)]. \nSuch statements aggregate over many diverse situations and lead to confusion. Generally societies are \ncomposed of poor as well as non-poor individuals and poverty is characterized by differential access to \nresources especially land. Stating that the poor in a particular region behave differently from the non-poor \nin terms of their relationship to land and are impacted differentially by it is not the-same as saying that \ngenerally low levels of development in a region are both a cause as well as a consequence of resource \ndegradation. While areas with low levels of development may have a larger proportion of the poor. regions \nwith relatively better levels of development can also contain significant proportions of poor people. In \norder to evaluate conciusively if the poor behave differently from the non-poor, it is crucial to be able to \nmaintain conceptual and analytical rigor. For this it is important to control for general levels of \ndevelopment, institutions, markets, infrastructure, resource quality and quantity and relationships that \ngovern the use of resources. \n6 For example, “increasing numbers of poor people live in areas that have little ago-climatic potential and \nare environmentally fragile.. .population pressure in these areas has decreased the productivity of land and \nincreased its vulnerability to flooding and soil erosion. This raises the question of the links between \npoverty and environmental degradation.. . . . . .These regions need a special development strategy for three \nreasons. First there potential for growth is limited. Second they are increasingly occupied by poor people \nwith the fewest skills and the least access to infrastructure and supplies. Third environmental degradation \nin these regions adversely affects both the immediate area and regions downstream or downhill.. .Poor \nfarmers are being marginalized and pushed to frontier areas. In addition population growth and the \ncommercialization of agriculture have forced farmers who once relied on environmentally sustainable \nforms of cultivation to use their land more intensively.. . But the intensification of traditi.onal farming \nmethods such as slash and burn agriculture has damaged the productivity of these marginal areas. Over \ngrazing and unmanaged irrigation and an ever widening search for fuel wood all accelerate \ndecline.. . Insecure land tenure and encroachments on common and state lands encourage soil mining \npractices that diminish the long term productivity of the land [World Bank (1990)]. \n’ For example, when peoples’ survival is at stake they are forced to farm increasingly marginal soils, to \nreduce fallow periods which would permit the soil to renew its fertility, to cut vital forests in their search \nfor arable land or fuel and to overstock fragile range lands [IFAD (1992)]. \n3 \nnumerous unresolved issues ranging from difficulties in conceptualization and definition. \nto those of measurement and empirical verification. The lack of a clear testable theory on \nthe interaction of the two processes and the vast heterogeneity of what is observed, \ncoupled with the limited and inadequate range of what is actually measured of the \nnumerous diverse elements of this interaction underlies these problems. \nThere are numerous difficulties associated with definition, measurement and maintenance \nof analytical rigor. Attempts at rigorous analysis generally gloss over the underlying \nassumptions and the inherently weak statistical basis. The emotionalism associated with \nimages of severely denuded hillsides or starving malnourished children tend to take over. \nThe debate looses further clarity through the involvement of several intellectual \ndisciplines that do not speak a common language. \nThe short- and long- term implications of land degradation are not very clear [see Scherr \nand Yadav (19931.’ Similarly, while knowledge about poverty is expanding rapidly, \nthanks in large parts to the massive international focus and resources brought to bear on \nits understanding in the past ten years or so; the existing state of knowledge is still far \nfrom providing a comprehensive understanding of all the complex dimensions of its \nprocesses.g Even less clear and limited is the understanding of the interactions of poverty \nand land degradation. 10 \nThis study is organized as follows: Initially the understanding on each process is \nevaluated. Issues connected with definition and measurement are highlighted and \ncurrently available empirical estimates are presented. Next the existing state of \nknowledge about the relationship between poverty and land degradation is evaluated. The \nempirical evidence and attempts to explain observed behavior are analyzed. The \nimplications of the current understanding for policy research generally and for the \nCGIAR in particular are presented in the final section. \n’ This study, part of the IFPRI 2020 exercise, presents the synthesis of discussions from a three-day \nworkshop of 35 experts from 14 countries representing a cross section of disciplines. The discussions at \nthis workshop were structured around four research paper prepared especially by IFPRI to address the land \ndegradation and food production linkages namely 1) an extensive literature review comparing existing \nstudies of the scale and effects of land degradation 2) a modeling exercise to simulate some of the effects \nof land degradation on global food production, trade and consumption [Agcaoili, Perez and Rosegrant \n(1995)], 3) a modeling exercise to simulate the process of land-use intensification in the drylands of the \nSahel to 2020 [Barbier (1995)], and 4) a review of ecological principles and natural resource degradation \nand improvements, and microeconomic foundations for changes in land management in tropical hillsides, \nalong with their implications for policy [Scherr, Jackson and Templeton (1995)]. \n’ Conclusion of the World Bank’s workshop on the “Future Of Poverty Analysis In The Bank”, March 16, \n1997 reported in Malik (1997). \nlo Studies on the direct empirical verification of the relationship between poverty and land degradation are \nextremely scarce. Scherr and Yadav (1995) after their comprehensive survey of available literature \nconclude that no consistent relationship between poverty and land degradation can be established. \n4 \n1.1 Defining Land Degradation and Sustainability \nThere are several definitions of land degradation. Land” degradation is generally defined \nas the reduction in the soil’s ability to contribute to crop production [Blaikie and \nBrookfield (1987)] and as a change to land that makes it less useful fclr human beings \n[Wasson (1987)]. Examples of land degradation can be found in erosion, salinization, \nwaterlogging, vegetation depletion, fertility loss, soil structure change, #and pollution of \nsoil. In each case the focus is on the physical or biological effects with land-use methods \nseen as the ultimate causes of degradation. Land degradation can take many forms.12 \nLand degradationI effects are often cumulative. The off-site effects (sedimentation of \nreservoirs and deposition of silt on downstream fields), both positive and negative, can \nalso be considerable. A formidable problem exists because there is no simple relationship \nbetween the physical phenomena and the perceptions of land by human beings. What is \nobserved in the present is the result of the interaction of several complex processes over \nlong periods of time. For complete detection and measurement of land degradation, a \nsystem is needed for monitoring change in physical, biological and social phenomena. 14 \nThe heterogeneity of the situations and the complex and changing (over time) interaction \nof the several processes involved have negative implications for precise measurement. I5 \nConcern with land degradation has heightened due to the increasing focus in policy \ncircles on sustainability. There are several definitions in use for sustainability in \n* ’ The concept of land used in such studies is broad. It is the extensive system of physical and biological \nmaterials and processes associated with the interface of the solid earth, terrestrial water bodies and the \n$r, and the works of human beings [Chisholm and Dumsday (1987)]. \nScherr (1998) classifies these to include: crusting, compaction, sealing, wind erosion, water erosion, \ndevegetation, over-tillage, impeded drainage, waterlogging, reduced waterholding capacity, reduced \ninfiltration, salinization, alkalinization, acidification, nutrient leaching, removal of organic matter, burning \nof vegetative residues, nutrient depletion, over-application of agrochemicals, industrial contamination, \ndecline in vegetative cover, decline in biodiversity, decline in species composition, decline in availability \nof valued species. Land degradation involves aspects of physical soil management soil Water management, \nsoil nutrient and organic matter management, soil biology management, vegetation management. \n13 \nDegradation and erosion are not the same although the terms are often used interchangeably. Erosion is \nonly one (though probably the most well known and significant) possible form of degraclation [Pagiola \n$;994)1. \nFor an excellent discussion of detection and measurement issues of land degradation processes see \nWasson (1987). \n” Much of what we know about the extent and nature of land degradation is based on 1) anecdotal \nevidence 2) suspended sediment measurements and 3) plot-level soil loss measurements. The anecdotal \nevidence, though generally visually spectacular, is often non-representative and does not control for the \neffects of other factors. The suspended sediment measurements are difficult to undertake and do not \nprovide information on the effects on yields. The plot-level soil-loss measurements come from test plots. \nThere are also serious issues of the representativeness of field conditions and practices associated with \nthese. Measurements are generally carried out in short periods - whereas actual soil loss varies \nsubstantially because of changes in other conditions. What are needed ideally are estimalres of long-term \naverage loss. Moreover, these measurements are generally limited to soil loss and not productivity loss. \nThese measurements generally assume that soil moved from one field is soil lost, whereas it might have \nmoved from one field to another. Because of these data problems often it is very difficult to decide on the \nexistence or severity of land degradation [Pagiola (1994)]. \n5 \nagriculture which leads to some confusion There is a need for a clear and widely agreed \nupon perspective. I6 Existing definitions can be broad and all encompassing. For example \nsustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the present generation without \ncompromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs [The World \nCommission on Environment and Development17 (1987)]. Sustainable development \nmeans more efficient use of arable lands and water supplies. It requires avoiding overuse \nof chemical fertilizers and pesticides so that they do not degrade rivers and lakes, threaten \nwildlife and contaminate human food and water supplies. It means careful use of \nirrigation to avoid salinization or water logging of croplands. It means avoiding the \nexpansion of agriculture to steep hillsides or marginal soils that wo.uld rapidly erode \n[World Resources Institute (1982)]. \nSustainability is often confused to imply zero depletion of the natural resource base or \nzero environmental costs. However, as Crosson and Anderson (1993) point out \n“agricultural production that imposes some resource depletion and environmental costs \ncan be sustainable as long as the costs of depletion and environmental damage are \nconsistent with rising per capita welfare”. From an economic perspective, degradation \nonly occurs beyond the socially defined optimal use level. Such degradation occurs where \nindividuals cannot or do not optimize returns to their resources (e.g., due to inadequate \ninformation) and/or because there is a’ divergence between private and social interests \n(e.g., externalities or inappropriate public policies) [see for example Scherr and Yadav \n(1995) and Binswanger (1989)]. \nThis lack of an agreed .persgective on sustainability has implications for how land’ \ndegradation is defined, measured and analyzed \nThere is general recognition that data.on the physica! .processes of land degradation as \nwell as on its economic and social consequences are sparse [Scherr and Yadav (1995)]. \nEarlier reviews of the evidence on land degradation around the world have also found this \nevidence to be “extraordinarily skimpy.” “ No country has comprehensive estimates of the \nproductivity consequences of land degradation or the rates of degradation from current \npractices” [Crosson and Anderson (1992)]. S everal other authors, including Biot et al. \n(1995), recognizing this inadequacy, have called for a thorough review of experimental \nand field data and a sharper focus, particularly, on robust and cheap methods of \nmeasurement in order to improve the understanding of the physical processes involved. \nThe problems associated with drawing representative samples for plot-level measurement \nhave meant that most aggregate es&mates are based on non-scientific methods of \n“raising” the information. Most estimates of the imptict of: land degradation are based on \nI6 The lack of an agreed perspective is brought out forcefully in the discussion on conceptual issues’relating \nto sustainable growth of agriculture by Crosson and Anderson (1993). Given the increasing concern with \nthe potentjal impact on the welfare of current and, in particular, future generations, the need for an agreed \nperspective for identifying measures that can guide analysis of policies, approaches, and achievements in \nthe field of poverty, natural resources, and the environment is obvious. \n” Generally referred to as The Brundtland Commissicg \n6 \n“objective assessments” by experts. Available aggregate estimates of the cost of \ndegradation have to be taken with even greater caution since they are based on standard \nformulas relating certain levels of degradation to estimates of yield losses. Attempts to go \nfrom the estimates of the effect of yield losses at the plot level to aggrega.te estimates of \nthe socioeconomic impact at the national or regional level have often been dubbed as \n“giant leaps of faith.” Even at the plot level the problems associated with measuring the \nphysical and social value consequences of alternative natural resource management \npractices and technologies are “big and complex” and not amenable to perfect solutions \n[Crosson and Anderson (1993)]. \nThe inadequate basis of the available numbers is, however, generally lost in the \nemotionalism that pronouncements of the catastrophic extent of land degradation \ngenerally stir up. Statements such as “over the last thirty years alone, the world has lost \nnearly one fifth of the top soil from its crop land, one fifth of its tropical rainforests and \ntens of thousands of plant and animal species” [Brown (1990)] stir up visions of \nimminent and impending doom. The literature associated with the “tragedy of the \nCommons” [Hardin (1968)] h as brought an increasing focus on the negative \nconsequences of the interaction of man and natural resources. Is On the other hand \ncomplacency, I9 based upon the phenomenal increase in agricultural (especially food) \nproduction during the past forty years or so, might well be misplaced. \nThere is thus a tremendous need to obtain a fuller understanding of the different aspects \nof soil degradation based on data generated through consistent definitions and scientific \nrigor. As already noted, the studies of the impact of soil degradation are based, in one \ncrucial aspect or the other, on the assessments of experts. In most countries the data used \nfor such estimates generally comes from a few studies that were not originally designed \nto generate estimates for the whole country.” Moreover, the capacity to monitor changes \nover time is limited by the weak statistical foundations and the lack of comparability in \nthe available data. \nAttempts are being made to address some of these concerns through research on land \nquality indicators [World Bank (1997)]. The land quality indicators (LQI) program2’ was \nl8 The Hardin study had brought the focus to bear on the tragedy of the global commons. The issues of \nland degradation relate more to local commons, \nI9 This complacency has been likened by some to the misconception of the man hurtling headfirst from the \ntop of a twenty story building stating merrily, as he falls past the ninth floor, that there is nothing serious to \nworry about because nothing has happened yet! The influential FAO study World Agricuhure Towmds \n2010 reflects this complacency ori an aggregate level [Alexandratos (19931. It does, however, highlight \nthe seriousness of the problem in certain regions. \n” For example U.S estimates of the.magnitude of soil erosion and the effects of soil erosion on land \n2P:oductivit-y come from only two sample surveys [Crosson (1986)]. \nThis program involves agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the Consultative Group on \nInternational Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The World Resources Institute, the International Food Policy \nResearch Institute. and other CGIAR institutions are also participating. \n7 \nset up under a coalition of international agencies in 1994. Its objective was to better \nunderstand the problems of land degradation. This program seeks to “develop a set of \nnatural resource indicators: statistics or measures that help characterize the conditions of \nnatural resources related to land. The program seeks to develop a set of standardized \nindicators (mainly focused on the local and district levels) to provide concise, reliable \ninformation about the condition of land, including the combined resources of soil, water, \nvegetation and terrain that provide the basis for land use” [Pieri et al. (19951. \nThe Global Land Assessment of Degradation (GLASOD22) is the first major exercise that \nhas sought to maintain some consistency in definitions in its endeavor to obtain aggregate \nestimates of land degradation [Oldeman, Hakkeling and Sombroek (1990)]. The \ncomparative study of dry lands by Dregne and Chou (1992) represents another important \neffort.23 While the GLASOD exercise was designed to study the problem at the \ncontinental scale, the latter study was designed for analysis at the national level but was \nlimited by the availability of national studies. The study [ASSOD] by van Lynden and \nOldeman (1997) represents a recent attempt at estimating land degradation. While the \nmethodology is basically the same as that for the GLASOD study, it permits analysis at \nthe national level while the GLASOD was focused on a larger regional level. \nThe GLASOD study estimated that nearly 2 billion hectares of the 8.7 billion hectares of \nvegetated area (agricultural land, pasture, forest and woodland) (22.5 percent) have been \ndegraded since the mid century. This study estimated that some 3.5 percent of the total \nhave been degraded so severely as to be reversible only through costly engineering \nmeasures if at all. Just over 10 percent has been moderately degraded and is reversible \nonly through significant on-farm investments. Another nearly 9 percent is lightly \ndegraded and easily reversible through good land management. The GLASOD estimates \nindicate that nearly one-half of this vegezated area is under forest, of which about 18 \npercent is degraded; 3.2 billion hectares is under pasture, of which 21 percent is degraded \nand nearly 1.5 billion hectares is in cropland, of which 38 percent is degraded. Water \nerosion is the principal cause of degradation. Wind erosion is an important cause, \nparticularly in dry lands and areas where land forms are conducive to high winds. \n” The GLASOD estimates are also subjective because these are based on experts’ estimation of land \ndegradation since the Second World War. \n” Studies listed in Scherr (1998) by methods used for assessment of soil degradation impacts include: \nQualitative assessments: Pagiola and Dixon (1997), Oldeman et al. (199 l), van Lynden and Oldeman \n(1997), Seghal and Abrol (1994) and Dregne (1990, 1992). Biophysical models of degradation-yield \nrelationships: Aune et al. (1997); Kilasara et al. (1995); Stocking and Benites (1996), Ca$sman et al. (1995) \nwith secondary price data to obtain estimates of value: Aune (1995), Pagiola (1997), Littleboy et al. (1996). \nAggregate, gross valuation of economic losses due to degradation and cost benefit analysis: Pimentel \n(1995),Yourig (1993), Lutz et al. (1994), McIntire ( 1994), White and Jickling (1994).

It accounts for a smaller overall proportion of degraded lands but \nmore than 40 percent of cropland degradation. Physical degradation such as compaction \naccounts for a smaller proportion of degraded area. According to the GLASOD estimates \ndegradation of cropland appears to be most extensive in Africa, affecting 65 percent of \ncropland area compared with 5 1 percent in Latin America and 38 percent in Asia. \nDegradation of pasture is also most extensive in Africa, affecting 3 1 percent, compared \nwith 20 percent in Asia and 14 percent in Latin America. Forest land degradation is most \nextensive in Asia, affecting 27 p.ercent of forest land compared with 19 percent in Africa \nand 14 percent in Latin America [GLASOD estimates reported by Scherr (I. 998)]. \nLand degradation can lead to declining potential yields on the farm. But, fertilizer use or \nchanging the land use can hide the effects of this degradation for long periods. As such it \nis almost impossible to establish a one-to-one relationship between the amount of \ndegradation and the effect on yields. Moreover, the level at which yields iare affected by \nchanges in land quality can differ by the type and variety of crop grown and by type of \nsoil and its depth etc. While measurements of land degradation generally cover only a \nshort peGod of time, any measurable effect on crop yields could however, take long \nperiods to appear because of the cumulative nature of land degradation. \n. \n9 \nFor developing countries the literature on land degradation is even more qualitative and \nless rigorous than that available for developed countries. The difficulty of modeling \ncomplex farming systems and the lack of necessary data both contribute to this paucity.24 \nMost glaring is the lack of knowledge of the effects of degradation on social welfare. \n“Most of the technical literature on the socioeconomic aspects of land degradation can be \nclassified into three broad categories: soil conservation as an input in agricultural \nproduction; top soil as a natural resource, somewhere between nonrenewabIe and \nrenewable; and the effects of land degradation on common property resources and \nexternalities” [Anderson and Thampapillai (199O)J. Studies at the household level that \nattempt to rigorously verify differences in behavior between the poor and the non-poor \nwith respect to land are generally difficult to find. This paucity results in large part from \nthe inadequacy of the available data.‘5 \nGiven some of the problems described above, there is an urgent need for a research \nagenda that builds up from a large number of case studies. In order to ensure common \nperspectives, such a research program should involve the biophysical scientists, the \nsocioeconomic experts and the land users working closely together. Use of consistently \ndefined household-level socioeconomic panel (longitudinal) surveys that have specific \nland-quality assessment modules in several of the “hot spots26” could provide effective \nanswers. ” Such surveys would also be extremely useful for studying the dynamics of \npoverty. \nMost of the available literature looks at the impact of land degradation in terms of crop \nproduction. Scherr (1998), based on her detailed review of this literature,** concludes that \n“many studies examine the gross impact of degradation on crop production ” [but] very \n24 \nThe lack of technical information such as rates of soil loss and physical parameters such as those \nrequired for the definition of the universal soil loss equation (USLE) leads some studies to use site \nparameters from specific developed country locations [see for example Veloz et al. (1985)]. \n” Careful analysis requires disaggregated and detailed data. The availability of disaggregated data on \npopulation, incidence of poverty, land use and infrastructure is essential for rigorous analysis. Such data for \nIndia enabled Fan and Hazel1 (1997) to show that public investments in less favored rainfed areas, [coupled \nwith high-yielding varieties, irrigation and education] would increase agricultural productivity and reduce \nrural poverty. And, that the resultant gain per unit of additional investment would be higher than similar \ninvestments in irrigated or high potential rain fed areas. Similarly, a study using the detailed 1992 -93 \nWorld Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey data for Viemam found that the highest impact on net \ncrop income would occur in Vietnam’s two poorest regions: the Northern Uplands and the North Coast \n[van de Walle (1996)]. \n26 Th ese “hot spots” in land degradation based on the recent assessment of an international group of \nexperts are presented in Annex 1. \n27 The IFPRI Pakistan panel survey of rural households collected information on land quality in 1993. \nHowever, this information, has not been analyzed to date. \n” Scherr (1998) contains the most comprehensive review of studies showing the impact of land \ndegradation.’ At the global level she reviews UNCOD (1977), UNEP (1980), Higgins et al. (1983), \nHarrison (1984), Mabbutt (1987), Buringh and Dudal (1987), Dregne and Chou (1992), Oldeman et al. \n( 1992), Pimentel et al. (1993), Steiner and Herdt (1993), Crosson (1994), Agcaoli et al. (1995), Dyson \n( 1996), Stocking and Benites (1996), Crosson (1997) and Scherr and Yadav (1995) \nlg Oodit and Somonis (1992) estimated that salinity has reduced the yield of major crops by 30 percent in \n10 \nfew examine the net effect, taking into account price effect, substitution of supply by \nother producing areas, or other secondary impacts. [And moreover] vex-y few studies \nincorporate into their analysis any active farmer response to degradation” [Scherr (1998)‘J. \nS&err could find only three studies that provided data relevant to the iassessment of \nhuman welfare impacts. These welfare assessments use different indicators to assess the \nimpact at national or international levels.jO A detailed review of the results and \nmethodological aspects of these studies is available in Scherr (1998) and is therefore not \nattempted here. However, results from the IFPRI simulations reported by her are \nreproduced below. \nSimulations based on the global food production and trade model developed at 1FPR.I \nunder different scenarios for degradation indicate that by the year 2020 an additional \nseven to nine million children will be malnourished under the assumptilons of severe \ndegradation. The baseline estimate from this model is two hundred and six million \nmalnourished children (so that this would imply approximately one to three percent \nincreases in the baseline). The results indicate that land degradation may not be as severe \na problem during the next two decades or so, as many believe. According to the \nsimulations, a decline in investment in agricultural research and infra.structure can \nproduce downturns of a similar magnitude. These results highlight another problem of \nsome concern; while the global picture may not be as bleak, the regional effect of land \ndegradation can be expected to be quite severe in some countries, for example China and \nPakistan. \n1.2 Classifying the Approaches to Land Degradation . \nBiot et al. (1995) have classified the main approaches to land degradation into three \ngroups. These they term as: the classic; the populist revolution that shares characteristics \nwith the neo-Marxist or world systems diagnosis of problems of land degradation and the \nneo-liberal counter revolution embodied in the approach taken by the World Bank. \nThe main characteristics of the three approaches as summarized by Biot et al. (1995) are \npresented below: \nthe fifteen million hectares of irrigated lands in Pakistan. The study by Crosson (1995) indicates that the \naverage productivity losses in the dry lands between 1945 and 1990 were in the range of 11.9 to 13.4 \npercent. Globally he calculates that if all strongIy and extremely degraded lands were restored there would \nbe a 15 percent yield increase. Given the spectacular growth in global food production and the secular \ndeclines in grain prices over this period it is obvious that other factors must have compensated for the \neffects of degradation on aggregate performance. \nj” The CGE model for Nicaragua, one of these three studies, finds a counter-intuitive positive effect of \ndegradation on peasant consumption [Alfsen et al. (1996) reported in Scherr (1998)]. \nVariable \nStructural causes \nof land degradation \nImmediate Causes \n11 \nMain Approaches to Land degradation \nClassic Populist \nover-population, resource distribution, \nbackwardness, lack of inappropriate technol- \nforesight, ignorance ogies \nmis-management by \nusers \nAcademic discipline; profession science; bureaucratic \nResearch framework \nTechnology \nsystematic empiricism \nsoil conservation works \nparticularly terracing \nPeasant behavior ignorant, irrational \ntraditional \nDiagnosis of problem environmental solution \nmis-management by \nState, capitalists, TNCs \nbig business \nsociology; activist \nRapid/Participant \nrural appraisal, \ncommunity as \nunit of analysis \nagronomic techniques \nof conservation \nvirtuous, rational \ncommunity minded \nsocio-political solution \nNeo-liberal \ninappropriate \nproperty rights \ninstitutions, \nprices and rapid \npopuln.

(1995) \nThe authors find that these approaches are neither sequential nor mutually exclusive. The \npresent emphasis on poverty as both a cause and an effect of environmental degradation \nis shared by both the neo-Marxist and the neo-liberal approaches. Concern with the issue \nof population pressures on natural resources which was a popular theme of the classic \napproach has also re-emerged in the neo-liberal counter revolution literature. These \napproaches differ basically in terms of the role of the State and in their emphasis on the \nstructural and immediate causes of land degradation. They also differ in terms of the \nassumptions regarding peasant behavior and in the diagnosis of the problem. This \nclassification emphasizes the perceptual nature of the problem identification and \nunderscores the inability of the available innovations to address the issue. Biot et al. \n(1995) state the basic dilemma as follows: “Land degradation is perceived to be a \n12 \nproblem, there are perceived to be many technological and institutional innovations that \ncan solve them and these have been promoted by aid organizations - ;and yet these \ninnovations seem not generally successful. Why?” \nAnswers to this dilemma lie in getting to the reality behind these perceptions to develop \ncommon perspectives. Detailed evaluation of the factors underlying these perceptions. \nshould bring together all the actors; the international and national research systems - \nbiophysical and social scientists, the donor/development agencies, governments at \nlevels and those who eke out a living from the land in the diverse situations around \nworld. \nthe \nall \nthe \n1.3 Defining Poverty \nPoverty is increasingly viewed as a multidimensional concept. It ha.s social and \npsychological effects that prevent people from realizing their potential [IFAD (1992)]. \nMeasurement of poverty can include material deprivation, isoIation, alienation, \ndependence, and lack of participation or freedom of choice of assets, vulnerability and \ninsecurity.” Introducing several such dimensions can seriously complicate the \nmeasurement problems. That is why most measurement is based on material deprivation” \ngenerally linked to the inability of incomes to meet basic nutritional demands. \nPoverty is, thus, operationally defined as the inability to attain a minimal standard of \nliving.” Generally a consumption-based3’ poverty line is used and estimates are made of \nthe head count index, the poverty gap ratio and a severity of poverty index.j’ The World \n31 Isolation is defined in terms of lack of physical access to roads and mass communication. Alienation can \nbe both functional and educational. Domination and dependence arise from tenurial relations. Agricultural \nfamilies that are tenants and sharecroppers can be dominated by and be dependent on rural .elites. Lack of \nparticipation in decisions involving their own well being result from the rural poor seldom belonging to \nformal groups or organizations. Lack of assets both physical and social, and vulnerability are important \ncharacteristics of the poor. There are several inter-linked socioeconomic processes that both create and \nperpetuate rural poverty. Amongst these, policy-induced processes that have a bias, which excludes the \nrural poor from the benefits of development generally, accentuate the impact of other poverty processes. \nDualism as an important poverty perpetuating process. In most ex-colonial societies small a.nd marginal \nfarmers are hurt because resources starting with the best land are pre-empted by large, primarily export- \noriented commercial farms [IFAD (1992)]. \n” Material deprivation can be reflected in serious protein and energy malnutrition. However, the evidence \nis mixed on the relationship between levels of poverty and levels of malnutrition. Studies in Pakistan find \nhigh levels of malnutrition amongst children whereas corresponding levels of poverty in other countries do \n;;t display the same levels of malnutrition [Malik and Malik (1992)]. \nThree questions are relevant to operationalizing this definition: How to measure the standard of living? \nWhat is meant by a minimal standard of living? And having thus identified the poor how to express the \n;Frall severity of poverty in a single measure or index? [Lipton and van der Gaag (1993)] \nExpenditures are found to be better measures of welfare than incomes especially at the lower ends of \nthe income distribution because these reflect the household’s ability to borrow to smooth c.onsumption. \nj5 The Forster-Greer-Thorbecke (1984) class of decomposable indices which are generally used as \nmeasures of poverty are presented in Annex 2. \n13 \nBank supplements the consumption-based poverty measure with others such as \nnutritional status, life expectancy, under five mortality and school enrollment rates in \nwhat it terms the Priority Poverty Indicators36 (PPIs). The World Bank is currently \nconsidered to be the largest repository of information on poverty in the world37. The \nresearch work at the Bank has confirmed that, in order to answer the question of how the \npoor have participated in the general improvements, it is necessary to move from \naggregate data to more disaggregated survey-based household-level data. Without such \ndisaggregated data it is impossible to conduct rigorous analysis of the decision-making \nprocesses of poor households?. \nPoverty measurement is difficult at the national level and even more so at the sub- \nnational and household levels. The quality and reliability of the data, where available, are \ngenerally questionable. Census taking is generally in its infancy in developing countries. \nIncreasing attention is only now being paid to the systematic collection of socioeconomic \ninformation through household representative income and expenditure surveys. The \nheavy costs involved generally imply that the data that such surveys yield are only \nrepresentative at the national or at most sub-national level. Given the nature and \ndistribution of poverty, such aggregate estimates can often be misleading. The ability to \nmatch the quantitative information with more qualitative data is generally severely \nlimited by the even greater scarcity of the latter. Even where such information is \navailable, meaningful integration is limited because these come from entirely different \nsamples and have generally been collected for entirely different purposes. The problems \nof the reliability and non-availability of the basic information are compounded by \nproblems associated in the measurement. The use of one cut-off point or poverty line for \nthe country as a whole aggregates across tremendous heterogeneity and does not \nnecessarily reflect the particular situation in a sub-region or segment. The use of a \nstandard calorie requirement cutoff so fashionable in previous studies, for example, \nmasked tremendous differences in minimum calorie requirements across regions due to \n‘G Non-income measures of welfare can include anthropometric measurement especially of vulnerable \ngroups such as children under the ages of five and pregnant and lactating mothers. The World Bank \naugments these direct income and non-income measures of poverty with information on socioeconomic \naggregates that indicate for example the access to social services. Access to social services denote the \n“public” incomes that the poor enjoy from the provision of health, education and other services that \ngovernments provide; consumption of which generally does not show up in household surveys. The Living \nStandards Measurement Surveys LSMS of the World Bank are especially designed to measure such access \nin addition to the other information that is generally required for computing the poverty measures. \nMoreover, the LSMS provide an element of consistency in the information that is available. However, \nthese LSMS surveys generally require enormous resources, which restrict the ability of the developing \ncountries to institutionalize them. The lack of such institutionalization implies that the information is \nsparse. There are very few countries for which comparable data are available over time. \n” The World Bank has mandated that detailed poverty assessments be undertaken for all its client \ncountries. In 1990 such assessments were available for eleven countries, which together accounted for forty \npercent of the total population of the developing world and for fifty percent of the poor. The older surveys \nwere less reliable than the more recent ones. The World Bank first began conducting poverty assessments \nin 1989. Since then a total of eighty-four (seventy-five countries and nine updates) assessments have been \ncompleted covering approximately ninety percent of the world’s poor. \n” Especially as these relate to the relationship with land. \n14 \ndifferences in body structures, climate and level.? of physical activity.” In the case of \nestimates of rural poverty, for example, such estimates generally ignored incomes in kind \nfrom home production and to that extent may have been significantly biased upwards. \nWhile considerable headway has been made at improving the quality of the aggregate \npoverty information there is still considerable variability in quality.40 This variability was \nconfirmed by a recent report of the Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank \n(1996).4* And while considerable headway has been made in counting the poor, \nconsiderably less has been done to explain why they are poor and in particular to explain \nwhat strategies for poverty alleviation work and why? While the need to move towards \nmore disaggregated data and analysis is keenly felt there is no hard evid.ence available \nthat shows that the poor as opposed to the non-poor behave differently in k.ey aspects and \nespecially in terms of natural resource management. The data available are generally at \nlevels of aggregation that limit their usefulness for analysis of specific land degradation \nproblems that generally have a locational dimension. The PPIs are avaiiable at the \nnational level for the countries for which these have been collected. This limits the \nusefulness for understanding specific processes related to poverty and the relationship to \nother processes such as land degradation. \nIFAD (1992) identifies five types of rural poverty. Material deprivation and alienation \ncause interstitial poverty, or pockets of poverty surrounded by power, affluence and \nownership of assets. Material deprivation can combine with isolation and alienation to \nlead to peripheral poverty, which is) according to this study, found in the rnarginal areas. \nMaterial deprivation arising from population pressure and limits on resources will breed \nalienation and overcrowding poverty. Vulnerability to natural calamities, (e.g., drought) \nlabor displacement, and insecurity, produces traumatic or sporadic poverty, which can be \ntransitory but often ends up being endemic. Isolation, alienation, technological \ndeprivation, dependence and lack of assets are also signs of endemic poverty. \n” The use of the parity adjusted expenditure of $l/day/person, currently in vogue at the PJorld Bank, has \nits own limitations [see Ravallion (1994, 1992)]. \nJO Poverty profiles answer the questions such as where are the poor? Who are the poor? Why are they poor? \nAnd is it transitory or chronic poverty? why are they poor? A poverty profile is a simply instrument for \nmaking poverty comparison. These can show how poverty varies across sub groups of society, such as \nregion of residence or sector of employment. A poverty profile can be extremely useful in accessing how \nthe sectoral or regional pattern of economic change is likely to affect aggregate poverty. If the poverty \nprofile shows that, for example, there is significantly more poverty in the rural farm sector than the non \nfarm sector then a policy reform which improves farmers terms of trade is very likely to reduce aggregate \npoverty [ KFbur (1987, 1990)]. \n” Only 54% of the 46 poverty assessments evaluated in this study met with the requirements. Most were \nfive years old and some were based on data that were more than ten years old. The report used the \nfollowing bench-marks for evaluation: 1) inclusion of a profile of Priority Poverty Indicators (PPIs) 2) \ndiagnosis of poverty 3) set of prescriptions for poverty reduction and 4) operational content of the \nprescription. \nThis classification is important for linking the types of poverty processes to the types of \npoverty produced and the segments of the population affected:“* According to the IFAD \n(1992) study, environmental degradation leads to both transitory and chronic poverty \n(IFAD terms these as peripheral and endemic poverty) and affects smallholders, landless, \nnomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisanal fishermen, refugees and households headed \nby women. The IFAD study contains an extensive classification of different types of \npoverty processes, the type of poverty that is produced, and the segments of the rural \npopulation affected by these, for 42 of the least developed countries. While this \nclassification is helpful. , given the nature of the data on which it is based, it is only \nindicative of the types of aggregate patterns. Given the heterogeneity of types that it \nindicates and the extremely aggregate available data that it marshals the study does not \nhelp in rigorously answering specific questions or in furthering the understanding of the \ninteraction of the poverty and land degradation processes. \nThis IFAD (1992) study remains to date the most extensive analysis of its kind available \nin the literature on rural poverty. Based on information for the late 195Os, this study \nestimated that over 80 percent of the poor people in the 114 countries for which it \nanalyzed available data were based in the rural areas. In the 42 least developed countries, \nthe study found that as much as 69 percent of the total rural population lives in poverty. \nThis figure was 3 1 percent for Asia, (46 percent if China and India are excluded), 60 \npercent in Sub-Saharan Africa. 61 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and 26 \npercent in the Near East and North Africa. In absolute terms these percentages translate to \n633 million in Asia, 204 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 27 million in the Near East and \nNorth Africa and 76 million in Latin America and the Caribbean. \nSubstantial improvement in aggregate global welfare has been achieved over the past few \ndecades. For example, between 1965 and 1990, world food production grew by 90 \npercent43 while population rose by 60 percent. This growth has, howetier, not been \n” This full classification assumes that the international processes produce traumatic/sporadic poverty \nwhich affects small holders, refugees, and households headed by women. Domestic policy biases produce \ninterstitial, peripheral, overcrowding, traumatic/sporadic and endemic poverty these processes affect small \nholders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artesinal fishermen, refugees and households headed \nby women. Dualism produces interstitial and peripheral poverty and affects small holders, landless, \nnomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisanal fishermen, refugees and households headed by women. \nPopulation pressure leads to peripheral and over crowding types of poverty. It affects smallholders, \nlandless, nomadic pastoralists and households headed by women. Environmental degradation leads to \nperipheral and endemic poverty and affects small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, \nartisinal fishermen, refugees and household headed by women. Natural cycles produce peripheral, \ntraumatic/sporadic and endemic poverty and affect small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic \ngroups, artisinal fishermen, refugees and households headed by women. Gender biases lead to endemic \npoverty and affect households headed by women. Cultural/ethnic biases produce interstitial and endemic \npoverty and affect ethnic groups exploitative intermediation produces interstitial, peripheral and endemic \npoverty and’affects small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisinal fishermen and \nwomen. Internal civil strife leads to traumatic/sporadic poverty and affects smallholders, landless, nomadic \npastoralists, ethnic groups, refugees and women [IFAD (1992)]. \n” The growth in agricultural production has resulted from the expansion of the agricultural systems; use of \nchemical fertilizers;pesticides, tools and machinery; improved seeds; and, land-improving investments \n16 \nuniformly distributed.44 The increase in food production has resulted largely from yield \nincreases. It is estimated that 93 percent of the incremental cereal output is due to \nintensification alone. Area expansion remains important in Africa and Latin America \naccounting for 40 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of cereal production increases \nover this period [Mink (1993)]. Average consumption per capita in developing countries \nhas also increased by about 70 percent in real terms; average life expectancy has risen \nfrom 51 to 63 years; and primary school enrollment rates have reached 89 percent. If \nthese gains-were evenly distributed, much of the world’s poverty would be eliminated. \nThe lack of comparable estiiates of poverty over time makes it difficult to evaluate \ntrends. However, based on heroic attempts to obtain comparable and consistent data sets, \nthe consensus appears to be that growth, even when it is associated with rising inequality, \nhas led to poverty reduction [Fields (1980), World Bank (1990, chapter 3) and Squire \n(1993)]. Ravallion and Datt (1994) estimate that the historical elasticity of the poverty \nhead count measure to mean consumption is about minus 1.5 for India. Bell and Rich \n(1994) estimate that the rural poverty head count responds to real agricultural output per \nhead, with an elasticity of minus 1.5 to minus 0.8, depending on model specification. \nNearly all avaiIable studies agree that agricultural growth (especially growth and \nstabilization of food staples production) is likely to benefit poor people.J’ There is some \nevidence to indicate that the level of initial inequality of incomes and of assets determines \nthe degree to which growth is translated to reduction in poverty [Lipton and Ravallion \n(1995)]. The evidence on the relationship of growth to inequality is however, mixed. \nThe World Bank Policy Research Department has an active program focusing on \nestablishing consistent patterns in the relationship between growth, inequality and \npoverty. Deininger and Squire (1996) and Ravallion and Chen (1997) present results \nbased on household data sets for a number of countries. While these “new” household \ndata sets represent improvements in quality and coverage it is important to bear in mind \nthe differences in definitions in the underlying data sets on which these estimates are \nbased. While the authors do consistently warn users to keep such inadequacies in mind, it \nis easy to loose sight of these warnings and focus only on the aggregate results that are \nbrought out. Mindful of the limitations such as the lack of tests for sensitivity and \nrobustness and the large number of factors identified by the authors that could affect cross \ncountry comparisons, the study by Deininger and Squire (1996) could find. no systematic \nlink between growth and changes in inequality. The study found, however, a strong \npositive relationship between growth and reduction in poverty. A later study by Ravallion \nand Chen (1997) uses a larger number of household surveys to define “spells” from 67 \nparticularly irrigation and drainage. \nU In Sub-Saharan Africa cereal production increased by only 60 percent while population increased by \n105 percent. \n” Some examples where agricultural growth is not necessarily pro-poor also exist [see Cohen (1975)]. \nHowever, the general experience is that agricultural growth works in several ways to improve the welfare \nof the poor. Its large direct and indirect multipliers on income and employment open up avenues for the \npoor to participate in the growth process. \n17 \ncountries between 198 1 and 1994 to conclude that changes in inequality and polarization \nwere uncorrelated with changes in average living standards. The results of the \nrelationship between inequality and growth were at best mixed. However, “almost always \npoverty fell with growth in average living standards and rose with contraction” [Ravallion \nand Chen (1997)]. \nThe relationship of poverty and land is intimate, given the prevalence of poverty in rural \nareas. Countries that are classified as low income have much higher shares of agriculture \nin GDP and even higher shares of rural labor force as compared to the industrial market \neconomies [World Bank (1990)]. Typically, the share of agriculture. in gross domestic \nproduct in the low-income countries is about 30 percent while the proportion of total \nlabor force in agriculture is about 68 percent. The corresponding figures for the industrial \nmarket economies are 6 and 2 percent, respectively [World Bank (1997)]. \nQuibria and Srinivasan (1991), in a comparative study of seven Asian developing \ncountries in the late 198Os, showed that rural poor depended more on agriculture than the \nrural non-poor did. This has also been observed in West Africa [Reardon et al. (1992)]. \nThe welfare of rural non-farm households also depends substantially on the forward and \nbackward production and consumption linkages from fanners [Chuta and Liedholm \n(1981), Hazel1 and Haggblade (1993) and Hazel1 and Ramasamy (1991)]. “Given the high \nlabor intensity and relevance to, local food availability and prices of agricultural products \nmost anti-rural-poverty strategies for production activities are based subStantially on \nagriculture” [Lipton and Ravallion (1995)]. \nThe lack of land and rural povkrty are generally observed t? coexist [Ravallion and Sen \n(1994)]. Generally three forms of interventions are suggested to improve the access of the \npoor to land [IFAD (1992)]. These are’redistribution ofpwnership rights, regulation of \ntenancy contracts and the role of land titling.“6 \nImproved equity and efficiency are generally put forward as justifications for land \nredistribution. Operationally, the implementation of such programs has been strongly \naffected by political realities. Redistribution implies increasing intensification with \npossible negative consequences for land degradation. At the same time, redistribution iS \nexpected to improve access to credit so necessary for the use of inputs. This can facilitate \ninvestments in land-improving and maintaining technologies. . \nTenancy reforms are also advocated on the basis of equity and efficiency. Such reform \ncan however, also increase landlessness through large-scale eviction as evidenced in \nSouth Asia. And within the different forms of tenancy arrangements, a move away from \nshare cropping arrangements can imply a reduction in traditional risk sharirig \narrangements with Qotential resultant pressures for resource degradation. \n46 There ‘is a belief that traditional tenure systems can achieve development objectives only under low \npopulation density .but are not compatible with rapid economic change and large increases in population \npressure. \n18 \nLand titling can have both positive and negative effects. The African experience bears \nthis out. *Theoretically, land titling is considered important for increasing tenure security \nwith a view to improving investment in land and water conservation. It is also held to \nimprove access to capital inputs and the adoption of permanent crops. It further provides \nthe collateral for ensuring increased access to institutional credit and for promoting land \nmarkets deemed to be so essential for the development of commercial agriculture. Lack \nof title can bias the farmer’s decision towards short-cycle crops. Operationally, however, \nthe wealthier farmers can exercise their influence to obtain greater rights [IFAD (1992)]. \nSuch titling can lead to likely negative effects on women through increased cultivation of \ncommercial crops that men generally tend to control [von Brawn and Kennedy (1986)]. \nIncome derived from common property resources is much more important to the rural \npoor than to the non-poor especially in the arid and semi arid regions. The studies by \nJodha (1985, 1986, 199 1) show that common property resources accounted for 20 percent \nof the income of households cultivating less than two hectares (including landless \nhouseholds) and between 1 and 2 percent amongst the non-poor households in 21 groups \nof villages in India. These studies also show that common property resources declined \nsharply in area and productivity between the mid 1950s and the mid 1970s. However, “it \nis the- combination of more people, high interest rates and other “‘short-termist” \nincentives, scarce land and inadequate technical progress that threatens ‘to validate the \nclaim that population growth in rural areas causes resource degradation -- and to do so \nwhatever the structure of property rights” [Lipton (1997a, p. 89)]. \nRural poverty also implies that the “wrong crops” may be gro.wn. In sub-tropical \nconditions most export crops (except cotton and groundnuts) tend to be less damaging to \nthe soil than cereals and root crops. Most export crops grow on trees and bushes and have \na continuous root structure and provide canopy cover. Repetto (1988) shows that, with \ngrasses planted underneath such export crops, the rate of soil erosion is su.bstantially less \nthan with food cr0ps.j’ Moreover, poor people are constrained in their access to credit, \ninsurance and capital markets. These conditions get translated into larger herd sizes \nespecially in times and places that have a high risk of draught and the possibility of \ngreater mortality amongst the herds. These extra animals can lead to overgrazing and land \ndegradation. \nMechanization that is labor displacing (especially if is subsidized) can have negative \nimpacts on poverty [Binswanger and van Braun (1993), Mellor and Desai (1985), Bell \nand Rich (1994), Ravallion and Datt (1994), Lipton with Longhurst (1989)]. Lack of \nalternative sources of employment can lead displaced families to scavenging off the land \nand common property resources leading to land degradation. The impact of irrigation on \npoverty is much less clear and depends on the technical features of the type of system \n47 However, the fact that women control food while men control cash crops can generally translate into \nreduced incomes of women with increasing commercialization and to the resultant deterioration in the \nnutritional status @f the families [see for example von Braun and Kennedy (1986)]. \n19 \nused [Narian and Roy (1980)] However, the processes through which irrigation leads to \nincreasing soil salinity are well documented in the ecological literature [see for example \nEhrlich, Ehrlich and Holdren (1977)]. \nRigorous analyses of the differential behavior of poor versus non-poor households in \nterms of land degradation are sadly deficient. Such analyses require specifically collected \ndata and detailed modeling of the household decision making processes. Collecting such \ndata is a resource-intensive process and often requires skills that are not generally \navailable in developing countries. Cost constraints generally imply small and often “non- \nrepresentative” samples. This leads to the obvious questions of the generalizability of the \nresults. There is a strong need to replicate such studies in as many situations as possible \nto be able to build up a body of knowledge for which conclusions can be generalized. \n1.4 Mapping Rural Poverty and Land Quality \nThe marginal lands study [Nelson et al. (1997)] had noted the great limitation in the \nunderstanding of the nature and distribution of marginal lands and the lack of readily \navailable data in a geo-referenced framework, in particular with respect to the incidence \nand nature of poverty and probability of land degradation by land type. The World \nResources Institute under a contract with UNEP/GRID/Arendal is conducting such a \nstudy [Henninger (1997)]. This work is part of the ongoing project to strengthen the use \nof geographic information systems in agricultural researcl14s and extends the previous \nwork done by the World Resources Institute in mapping indicators of human \ndevelopment for West Africa. The set of poverty indicators used by the World Bank have \nbeen expanded to include accessibility (i.e., the degree to which people have access to \nresources) and vulnerability (low income groups who face high income uncertainty \nbecause of natural resource degradation). By including vulnerability defined in this way \nthe researchers are hoping to identify a large proportion of people who can be easily \npushed into poverty when the natural resource sector they depend on for their basic needs \nis being degraded. \nHenninger (1997) notes that the degree to which individual or geographic factors are \ncausing poverty has implications for developing a strategy for agricultural research, \nwhich tends to improve the situation of the poor. If geographic factors play an important \nrole then geographic targeting of agricultural research to the poor in these areas can \nbecome a useful tool to address poverty issues. This, of course, assumes that the ability of \nindividuals to migrate out of these marginal areas is restricted. There is some evidence to \nsupport this assumption. The work by Ravallion (1994) shows significant spatial effects \non living standards after controlling for non-geographic characteristics. These he terms as \n48 \nThe idea of defining and mapping major regions of the world in terms of climate, soils and natural \nvegetation as an aid to agricultural planning is not new. Systems of classification date back to the 1930s. \n[Koppen and Giger (1936), Troll and Paffen (1965), and Papadakis (1975 reported in Henninger (1997)]. \nThese have proved useful in the work of the international agricultural research centers. \nspatial poverty traps. \n20 \nThe data limitations for mappin, 0 marginal lands in most developing countries were \nhighlighted by the iMarginal Lands Study melson et al. (1997)]. The soil and length of \ngrowing period maps used to define the marginal agricultural lands and the favored \nagricultural lands included no information on land cover or use. Population data were \nonly available at the first sub-national level and a constant poverty rate was applied for all \nareas within a country [Henninger (1997)]. Such data limitations were also evident in the \nIFPRI study by Broca and Oram (1990). These shortcomings will, however, remain till \nmore detailed data become available. The World Bank”s Living Standards Measurement \nSurveys and the Macro International’s Demographic and Health Survey data sets which \nare the most likely sources of data for the socioeconomic aspects of such endeavors were \noriginally designed to yield results representative at the national level. These were \noriginally not intended to be broken down by sub-national units: \nThe usefulness of these mapping exercises is constrained by the aggregate level of the \navailable comparable information. Ranking of countries and territories according to the \nrural poverty dimension needs to be strengthened with more disaggregated information \nfrom several sources to make such exercises more effective for prioritizing research \nactivities. Where the research mandate already has a clear natural resource mandate such \nrankings can assist in effectively prioritizing activities [e.g., ICARDA (I 99’73. \n3 “. POVERTY AND LAND. DEGRADATION \n. \nLipton (1997a) states forcefully that it is irrational to expect people to kno.wingly behave \nin ways that destroy resources necessary for their survival or that of their future \ngenerations 49 unless very strong pressures to do so are present. j” He lists four. such \npressures generally discussed in the literature.” These include (1) increases in population \nas mortality falls but fertility declines lag and (2) declines in common property resources \n” Often the problems of poverty, population and the environment are intertwined: earlier patterns of \ndevelopment and the pressure of rapidly-expanding population mean that many of the poor live in areas of \nacute environmental degradation [World Bank (1990)]. \n” The World Bank maintains a similar position. “The poor do not willfully degrade the envirohment but \npoor families often lack the resources to avoid degrading their environment. The very poor, struggling at \nthe edge of subsistence, are preoccupied with day to day survival. It is not that the poor have inherently \nshort horizons; poor communities often have a strong ethic of stewardship in managing their traditional \nlands. But their fragile and limited resources, their often poorly defined property rights, and their limited \naccess to credit and insurance markets prevent them from investing as much as they should in. \nenvironmental protection. When they do make ihvestments they need quick results [World. Bank (1992 p. \n30)]. . \n5’ According to the World Bank the main source of pressures generating problems of degradation is \nthought to lie in rapid population growth. Other pressures come from the widespread use of natural \nresource intensive technologies; ineffective regulation of common property resources; land tenure systems \nthat do not secure long terms rights to land use; and policies that distort the prices of non-renewable \nresources [World Bank 199 1, in Biot et al. (19931. . \n21 \n(CPRs). In addition there are international pressures; including (3) interest rate changes \nand (4) technology transfers [Lipton (1997a)]. \nPoverty generates significant incentives to have large families. Traditionally the impact of \npopulation growth on natural resources was discussed in terms of “carrying capacity.j2” \nConceptually, if nothing else changes, then it is assumed that the increasing population \nwill put demands on the resources that can no longer be met without damaging the ability \nof these resources to support human life. Social and economic factors such as trade, \ntechnology, consumption preferences and levels of inequality can alter the carrying \ncapacity. Poor people will often use migration as a coping strategy. However, migration \nmay not always benefit rural environments since the absolute numbers of rural people \nmay continue to increase. \nLipton (1997b) notes that technology generation in agriculture remains exogenous to \nmost of the developing countries and is not driven significantly by their resource saving \nor other requirements. This is the classic choice of techniques problem highlighted in the \nliterature on industrial development during the 1970s that first made popular terms such \nas “technological determinism.” This argument holds that the technically efficient \ntechniques are generally developed in the capital-abundant labor-scarce devefoped \ncountries and generally reflect the factor endowments of these countries. \n2.1 Impact of Degradation on the Poors3 \nThe poor g;~erally have access only to areas that have higher risk for health and income \ngeneration. And they generally lack the resources to reduce the exposure to the risk or \nto invest in alleviating the causes of such risk. Environmental degradation therefore can \naffect the health and nutrition status of the poor and lower their productivity. This can \nhappen both directly through, for example, lower yields per unit of labor or land because \nof reduced soil quality, and indirectly through the reduced physical capacity of labor to \nj2 Attempts to compare current and projected populations to potential population supporting capacities \n(PSCs) at certain levels of technology have found that with low input technologies typical of current \nproduction practices 1975 populations had already exceeded carrying capacities in several West African \ncountries. The study by Higgins, Kassam and Miken (1983) predicted that 7 of the 8 Sahelian countries \nwill exceed population-supporting capacities by the year 2000. Regional imbalances and environmental \n$.mage were greatest in the Sahel0 Sudanian zone despite low population densities. \nMuch of the discussion in this and the following subsection draws heavily from Mink (1993) \nj4 The most debilitating risk is that of drought in semi arid tropical areas. The combination of poverty and \ndrought can have serious environmental consequences that threaten future agricultural productivity and the \nconservation of natural resources. Poor people are induced to scavenge more intensively during droughts, \nseeking out wood and other organic fuels, wild life and edible plants, both to eat and to sell. This \nscavenging aggravates deforestation and damage to watersheds and soil already under stress from the \ndrought. The problem is aggravated in common property pastoral farming where farmers carrying extra \ncattle as insurance against drought may exploit and over burden the carrying capacity of the land increasing \nthe likelihood of permanent damage. Small ruminants can be exceptionally damaging to resources. Poorer \nhouseholds are generally responsible for raising small ruminants, which are allowed to graze low quality \nresources especially on open access and common property land [IFAD (1992)]. \n22 \nproduce because of malnutrition and poor health. Even in cases where the poor are \nhealthy labor productivity can be low due to increased time being allocated to less- \nproductive activities such as fuel wood collection and away from agriculture and other \nincome generating activities [Kumar and Hotchkiss, 19881. In terms of the productivity of \nthe resources that the poor manage, the decline is intricately related to the p’overty- \npopulation-environment interaction [Mink (1993)]. Where the poor depend on biomass \nfuel and confront increasing fuel wood scarcity they often shift to using animal dung, \nfodder and crop residues for fuel. The quantities of these materials that are returned to the \nsoil are thus reduced and its fertility declines. 55 Non-replenishment of soil nutrients leads \nto soil exhaustion as fuel wood supplies diminish and animal manure is increasingly used \nas a fuel substitute. Poverty forces a trade-off between the immediate demands for fuel \nfor cooking and heating and manure for the land. The time-preference argument suigests \nthat the immediate and urgerit needs be satisfied. Mortimore (1989) shows how soil \nexhaustion occurs when certain nutrients are taken from the soil but are not replenished \nnaturally or artificially with fertilizers. A homogenous crop, usu+ly a cash crop, grown \nrepeatedly on the same piece of land can lead to soil exhaustion. ‘~5 Increasing population \npressures on land can also lead to shortened fallow periods and this coupled with the \nfarmer’s inability to apply variable inputs more intensively because of poverty, can lead \nto decreased soil productivity. Productivity, especially, in open-access natural resources \nor of resources under deteriorating common property management may often decline due \nto over-use. \n2.2 Poverty Impact on Resource Management \nPoverty is generally assumed to impose short time horizons.” Theoretically this results \nfrom the poor having high rates of pure time preference which lowers the ability to forego \nconsumption today. This leads to using up savings previously set aside for later \nconsumption and to borrowing if access to credit is available. The implicatioris’ of a high \nsubjective discount rate are rapid resource extraction to meet present income or \nconsumption needs and low investment in natural resources to improve future returns. \nOvergrazing of pastures and shortening of fallow periods can result from the high \nsubjective discount rates. Similarly, farmers are less likely to make natural resource \ninvestments where returns are expected after a number of years. These factors combine to \nlead to a wide divergence between private and social discount rates.” ‘The empirical \nevidence on whether the poor really do have high rates of time preference is limited and \nj5 The loss in grain production as a result of diverting dung from fertilizer to fuel use in. Africa, the near \neast and Asia has been estimated at up to 20 million tons per year [Redclift and David (1990)]. \n56 Given the declining yields on the land and the inability to find the institutional support in terms of \nfertilizer and access to credit and technology, poor farmers are forced to sell their land and become land \nless peasants or to encroach on new forest lands [de Graaff (1993)]. \n” This is not to say that short time horizons are exclusive to the poor. \n‘* Veloz et al. (1985) in their analysis of a soil conservation project in the Dominican Republic show that \nsoil conservation is profitable on only 20 percent of the land area using private analysis. Alternatively \nsocial analysis based on discount rates that reflect the society’s inter temporal preference:;, indicate that \nsoil conservation is viable in nearly 70 percent of the land area. \n23 \nRisk aversion can lead to a short time horizon. To the extent that outcomes in the future \nbecome less certain than outcomes closer to the present, people will prefer to trade the \nmore uncertain outcomes for the more certain ones. Risk aversion amongst farmer is \nwidely documented [e.g., Binswanger (1980), Walker (1981), Grisley (1980) and Sillers \n(1980)]. The results of these studies generally indicate that attitudes of the poor to risk are \nnot distinguished from those of the non-poor by innate or acquired characteristics but by \nthe higher levels of risk faced by the poor and by the greater constraints to coping with \nthese risks. Deteriorating land quality brings not only poorer yields but also greater yield \nfluctuations and hence higher risk.60 To the extent that access to common property \nresources serves as insurance for the poor in times of setbacks to the primary sources of \nincome, the decrease in access can increase the risk. Migration can benefit the \nenvironment through mitigating risk.6’ Individual migration is increasingly seen as an \noutcome of family decision making, particularly in response to uninsured risks [Stark \n(1991)]. \nThe poor face greater constraints to managing their risks. Their assets and stored \nproduction are generally minimal. Their access to credit and insurance is generally \nlimited and or non-existent. Rural credit and insurance markets in developing countries \nare notoriously fragmented. In most cases there is also a gender bias so that poor women \nhave far less access to mechanisms for managing risk than their male counterparts. If risk \nis allowed for, the interest rate incentive to deplete is probably sharpened. “Higher \ninterest rates reduce the present value burden of long term future risks relative to that of \nnear term risks (and costs). The land use patterns are therefore shifted towards activities \nwith long-term risks such as possible long-term resource degradation. There is thus a \npowerful resource depleting incentive created by rising interest rates. Costly credit \nundoubtedly shifts the composition - of inputs, outputs, techniques, investment, \nconsumption and savings - sharply in a resource depleting direction” [Lipton (1997a)]. \n2.3 The Links Between Poverty and Land Degradation - Mixed Empirical \nEvidence \nThe study by Grepperud (1997) concludes that in the relationship between poverty, land \ndegradation and climatic uncertainty it is unclear whether poverty in general induces \nfarmers to manage their resources poorly in the long run. The study by Scherr, Jackson \nand Templeton (1995) also found no consistent relationship between population density \nor the frequency with which land is used for productive purposes and degradation of the \nland. Population growth and poverty, they noted, create both incentives and disincentives \nj9 The ICRISAT study by Pender and Walker (1990) which estimated high rates of time preference through \nexperimental games for a small sample of poor farmers in India is generally cited as an example. \n60 \nReardon and Vosti (1997) note that generalized poverty erodes traditional community risk sharing or \ninsurance institutions by over taxing them; forcing the poor to fend for themselves often turning to \nresource mining and commons dependent strategies. \n” Remittances are an important coping strategy for rural poor [Alderman and Paxson (1992)]. \n24 \nfor land degradation. There is an extreme dearth of studies that seek to rigorously test \nthese relationships. The lack of appropriate data underlies this paucity. To do this \neffectively information is required not only on the physical aspects of the land but also of \npoverty and a host of other factors that need to be controlled for. Such data are not \navailable at the present time. Reliance therefore has to be placed on studies from which \nthe relationships can be inferred. \nMost of the available studies look at the problem in terms of the behavior of small-scale \nfarmers and land degradation. Southgate (1988) maintains that small-scale farmers have \nbeen the main agents responsible for land degradation activities. He states t:hat market and \ninstitutional failure were the primary causes for farmers adopting non-sustainable \npractices. Pagiola (1995) shows how government price controls on agricultural goods in \nKenya have not provided incentives for the small-scale and poor farmers to conserve their \nland. In some cases this has led to the mining of resources for maximum output. \nMortimore (1989), on the other hand, finds evidence of small-scale farmers’ willingness \nto forgo short-term income gains even under price and famine pressure to pursue long \nterm sustainable management strategies. The existence or non-existence of secure land \ntenure systems might explain the contradiction of results about small farmer behavior. \nSeveral studies cite the lack of secure land tenure as the primary reason for poor farmers \ncultivating their land excessively to exhaustion for the simple reason that they have no \nvested interest in conserving an asset that they do not own [see, for example, Southgate \n(1988), Mink (1993), Repetto et al. (I 989)]. \n2.4 Household Level Effects of Degradation \nChange in agricultural practices can have primary and secondary effects on the \nenvironment. Von Braun (1997) describes the relationship between agricultural change \nand the eventual effects at the household level through these environmental effects. Such \nchange has come about in the large part of the world through the adoption of the green \nrevolution type technologies. Agricultural change can also occur where green revolution \ntechnologies have not been (as yet) adopted. In the case of the latter, the primary effects \non the environment are generally stated to be in the form of desertification, deforestation, \nwatershed degradation, soil erosion and soil fertility decline. The secondary effects can be \ndroughts and floods. These environmental effects can translate into specific effects at the \nhousehold level. These effects can take the form of impoverishment/produ.ctivity decline, \nmigration-related health stress, vector borne disease (if the migration occurs into disease \nprone areas), communicable disease (when sanitation breaks down), chronic food \ninsecurity, seasonal malnutrition and famines. In the case of the green revolution \ntechnology, potential environmental degradation can result from each Ielement in the \ntechnology package. It can result from the direct use of each of the technology elements \nand through indirect effects as well. For example, irrigation can lead to reduced water \nquantity or quality, salinization, increase in mosquitoes, aquatic snails and blackflies. \nInappropriate pesticide use can have harmful household effects. Fertilizer use can result \nin nitrates leaching into drinking water. At the household level these aspects of potential \n2.5 \nenvironmental degradation can translate into diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, \nmalaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, poisoning and diseases of the circulatory system \nin infants. The secondary effects of the use of such technology can be crowding, \nsanitation deficiency, diet change and vector control (through inappropriate pesticide \nuse). These can lead to communicable diseases, nutritional diseases and poisoning etc. \nThese household effects imply a reduction in welfare, which under the conventional \nconsumption based methods of measuring poverty, might not show up as such. That is \nwhy it ‘is important to include the non-income measures of poverty such as \nanthropometric measurements in assessments of the poverty status. \n2.5 Conceptualizing the Linkages Between Poverty and Land Degradation \nVosti and Reardon (1997) present an interesting conceptual model of the linkages \nbetween poverty and the environment that helps to highlight the complexity of the \nrelationships. Poverty is seen to be the product of “asset” components comprising natural \nresources (private and commonly held), human resources, on-farm resources, off-farm \nresources, community-owned resources and social and political capital. These links are \nshown in Figure 2. These determine household and village behavior in terms of income \ngeneration, consumption, investment in assets, migration and human fertility, which in \nturn has implications for use and management of the natural resource component that, \ndetermines the asset components of poverty. How natural resources are used and \nmanaged feeds back as a determinant of the asset components of poverty. A set of \nconditioning factors governs the relationship between the asset components of poverty \nand household and village behavior and between the household and village behavior and \nthe natural resource components. These conditioning factors are markets (prices), village \nand regional infrastructure, technologies (production and conservation), village level \nasset poverty and population pressures. \nThis conceptualization leads to innovative policy implications. In comparing traditional \nproductivity investments such as irrigation, fertilizer and modem seeds with conservation \ninvestments (such as bunds, terraces, windbreaks and practices such as organic matter \napplication) the study finds that the latter have different requirements and characteristics. \nConservation investments need innovative policies beyond just “getting prices right”. The \nthree non-price policies suggested by the study are: complimentary public infrastructure \ninvestments (such as culverts to divert water flow from farm bunds) that make household \ninvestments more profitable to institutional innovations; that improve security and \ntransferability of resource tenure; and, that modify community level arrangements to \nimprove the management of the commons or watershed [Vosti and Reardon (1997)]. In \nthe same book, von Braun (1997) also points out that poor communities lack resources \nfor community level investments such as physical infrastructure, health and education. \nPolicies that strengthen traditional institutions and make them more flexible (particularly \nin the face of increasing population pressure) can reduce poverty and the dependence of \nrural poor on resource miming especially in response to draughts and floods. \n26 \nDefining poverty in the Vosti and Reardon (1997) manner sets a much higher cutoff than \nthe conventional definition. Implicit in this conceptualization is the assumption that \nsizeable resources 62 over and above meeting bare subsistence consumption and \nproduction are required by the poor to address issues of resource degradation. While this \nmodel provides an interesting tool for conceptualizing some of the comple,xities involved; \nit also highlights the trade-off between the depth and detail of und.erstanding and \nconcomitant data requirements; and, the inadequacy of available methodology and \nresources for measurement. \nG2 Estimates of the capital costs of prevention vary with the farming system, the methods used and \ntopography. Expenditures of $50-$150 per hectare (sometimes less) for such measures as farm forestry and \ncontouring with vetiver grass or other vegetative barriers are typical; $200-$500 may be required per \nhectare for structural measures (terracing, land leveling, earth banks and the like) on undegraded lands. \nRehabilitation, in contrast, may cost from $500 to several thousand dollars per hectare, depending on the \nseverity of the problem [FAO (1992)]. \n27 \nFigure 2.

For \nsimplicity he postulates four possible, though not mutually exclusive relationships64. \nThese are \nRl: Poverty leads to Environmental Degradation \nR2: Power Wealth and Greed leads to environmental Degradation \nR3A: Institutional Failure leads to environmental degradation \nR3B: Market Failure leads to Environmental Degradation \nR4: Environmental Degradation leads to Poverty \nIf only Rl is observed then the poverty induced environmental degradation argument can \nbe accepted. However based on the initial conditions only exogenous poverty can cause \nthis environmental degradation. On the other hand if only R2 is observed then policies \nadopted under Rl assumptions can be misleading and may in fact exacerbate the \ndegradation process, as demonstrated by Binswanger (1989). In case of either R3A or \nR3B being responsible for environmental degradation, the solution is theoretically \nrelatively simple - remove or correct the market or institutional failure. If R4 is present \ntwo interesting observations arise. First R4 can only be present if it is caused by Rl, R2, \nR3A, or R3B or various combinations of all four. Second, the presence of :R4 can set into \nmotion an Rl type of link but in this case it is indigenous poverty, wh.ich causes the \nenvironmental degradation. This is the Rl feedback or RlFB link. \nIn the Rl, R4 link two outcomes are possible. The first scenario would be that Rl causes \nR4 and the causality link ends. On the other hand we can get a situation whereby the \nindigenous poverty caused by R4 sets into motion more environmental degradation by a \nRlFB relationship. The downward spiral of poverty leading to degradation leading to \nmore poverty puming (1989)] is an RlFB type of relationship. The vari0u.s permutations \nand combinations of these four relationships highlight the complexity of the relationships. \nThe model has four contributing forces namely: the power greed and wealth factor; \nexogenous poverty; institutional failure; and, market failure. It addresses two externalities \nnamely environment degradation and indigenous poverty. The fear of losing land by the \npoor is a direct function of R2. R3A is also a primary contributor to land degradation in \nthis manner. RlFB can be a contributory factor for soil exhaustion because of two \nreasons: first from within the sector due to decreases in agricultural productivity, and \nsecond from the fuelwood-manure relationship. In the first case, there is evidence of \ndeclining agricultural productivity in degraded lands causing indigenous poverty, which \nin turn forces many of the people to continue to degrade their land further to extract \n” He defines indigenous poverty as poverty caused by environmental degradation and exogenous poverty \nas that caused by factors other than environmental degradation. \nG4 He postulates three crucial initial conditions: 1) no environmental degradation, 2) no indigenous poverty \nand 3) the possibility of the existence of exogenous poverty. \n29 \nsubsistence outputs. The R2 link in the forest sector can cause an RlFB affect in the land \ndegradation category. R2, R3A, R3B and RlFB Iinkages can cause salinization. In the \ncase of desertification, the primary links highlighted by Durriapah are R2, R3A and R3B. \nDurriapah concludes that most environmental protection programs fail because they \naddress only the symptoms while they ignore the causes, i.e. they address only \nindigenous poverty and ignore its causes. \n3. SUSTAINABLE LAND USE MANAGEMENT \nMuch of the literature that assumes that poverty leads to degradation cannot explain \ninstances of (materially) poor communities living sustainably with their environment for \ncenturies. Induced innovation theory suggests that degradation at least in the long run \nmay be self-correcting as resource scarcity and rising private and/or social costs from \ndegradation induce the development and use of new agricultural and resource \nmanagement practices6’ [Hayami and Ruttan (1985) and Boserup (1965)]. \n‘j “Farmer-based innovation” describing the evolutionary process of adapting production technology to \nchanges in factor scarcity is reported in a number of studies [for example, see Binswanger and Ruttan \n(1975) Hayami and Ruttan (1 SSS)]. These explanations draw their inspiration from the experience of the \nland scarce agricultural economy of Japan, where by the late 1800s biological innovations had begun to \nincrease yields per unit of land while the United States which had many times more land per head of \nagricultural labor, had adopted a mechanized form of agricultural technology. It was, in response to rising \nland values in the 1940s that biological innovations were adopted widely in the United States. \nThe evidence presented in Farming Systems in the Tropics documents a large literature showing \nthat agricultural innovations are historically associated with increasing population density or increasing \nmarket integration in different agroecological zones [Rutenberg (1980)]. This study strongly suggests that \nmost innovation in the tropics was either endogenous or resulted from transfer/adaptation between trading \npartners. Similarly much of the technical change in crop management and landscape management was a \nconsequence of the crises in soil management. Pingali, Bigot and Binswanger (1987) document a similar of \nfarm management in the area of mechanization. \nOther examples of largely endogenous transformation to local land- use innovations and local \ninstitutional development include the widely cited experience of the Machakos district in Kenya [Tiffen \nand Mortimore (1994)]. This heavily degraded area with its very low agricultural productivity and income \nhad a population density beyond its “carrying capacity” in the 1930s. Yet over a 60-year period, although \nthe population increased five-fold and the resource base has not been rehabilitated, the estimated value of \nagricultural production at constant prices has increased threefold. Despite considerable movement into \nmore marginal agricultural zones, there is widespread tree-growing, most agricultural land has been \nterraced; and many new agricultural technologies are in use. The availability of good roads, opportunities \nto grow high value-added products for the Nairobi market and access to capital for land-related investments \n(terracing, tree growing, live fencing, water harvesting) enabled this change. The opportunities to generate \noff farm incomes aided in the process. \nSeveral other examples available in literature deserve to be mentioned. A study by Scherr (1993) \ndocuments the case of two districts in the mid- altitude region of Kenya near Lake Victoria where \ndegradation of land and reduced crop yields and subsistence scarcities led to agroforestry strategies \noriented towards intensification. The studies by Migot-Adholla et al. (199 1) and Place and Hazel1 (1993) \ndocument endogenous change in property rights in Africa. Place and Hazel1 (1993) found that the binding \nconstraints to agricultural productivity were in fact lack of improved technology and inadequate access to \ncredit. \n30 \nThe Induced Innovation Model in Natural Resource Management assumes that, with \nincreasing population density or market demand, four distinct phases/time periods of \nmanagement response can be identified. In the model the total supply of services and \nproducts from a given resource are a function of its quantity, quality and productivity of \nuse. The first phase is characterized by dependence on naturally occurring, resources. The \nsecond stage marks the period of resource degradation. The third phase marking the onset \nof resource rehabilitation occurs with transition to intensive management because the \nbenefits from the investment in resource rehabilitation outweigh the costs. The fourth \nphase is characterized by dependence on human managed resources ( for example agro- \nforestry, forest plantations and managed reserves). Most of the observed degradation can \nbe explained by assuming that the innovative responses of phases three cvr four have not \noccurred. In many cases it can be shown that these have been delayed due to a number of \nconditions. \nHowever, there is considerable controversy over the adoption of conservation strategies. \nOne school of thought maintains strongly that adoption of land conservation technologies \nis low across all agricultural environments despite major support and investment in \nresearch and development on the roblem. Instances where land degradation management \nhave been successful are known 6! but analysis of these instances have ntot yet provided \nclear guidance to policy makers, researchers or developers to enable: more general \nadoption of these technologies [World Bank (1991a)l. The other school maintains that the \nlack of adoption of conservation technologies results from a lack of incentives.67 “The \nsuccess of conservation measures is highly dependent on farmers receiving crop yield and \neconomic benefits in the first or second season after implementation’? [FAiO (1989)]. This \ndebate highlights the need to understand more fully why resource users do what they do, \nand how they reach decisions on resource use and environmental management [Biot et al. \n(1995)]. This debate does not difXerentiate between the behavior of poor versus non poor. \nGO Several successful farmer controlled soil conservation methods have been deveIoped and implemented at \nreasonable cost: A century’s old practice in India is being rediscovered, adapted and promoted. Deeply \nrooted, hedge forming vetiver grass, planted in contour strips across hill slopes, slows water run off \ndramatically, reduces erosion, and increases the moisture available for crop growth. A quiet revolution has \ntaken place and today 90 percent of soil conservation efforts in India are based on such biological systems. \nIn the Sahel simple technologies involving construction of rock bunds along contour line:; for soil and \nmoisture conservation in Burkina Faso have on average increased yields by 10 percent in normal years and \nin dryer years by almost 50 percent. The Central Visayas Regional Development Project in the Philippines \ncouples the promotion of contour grass strips for erosion control with distribution of young animals. The \ncost of preventing soil erosion and degradation are comparatively small while the costs OF rehabilitating \ntegraded areas can be large [FAO (1992)]. \nInvestment in land will. depend on the importance of the farm vis. vis. non-farm incomes. There is \nconsiderable evidence that non-farm and off-farm incomes are relatively more important to livelihood \nsecurity in areas with poor land [See Adams (1995) for exampies from fragile agricultural areas in \nPakistan]. \n31 \n4. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY \nIn the heterodox policy approach to land degradation currently in vogue the “solutions to \nland degradation are thought to lie in out-migration, training poor people in better \ntechnjques of farming, diversification and off farm employment, providing local user \ngroups with rights to manage degraded communal lands.. .Policies to make land tenure \nmore secure in areas in which traditional tenure systems have broken down.. .adoption of \nlow cost, low input technologies that would increase and stabilize yields, diversify \nproduction and maintain the resource base.. (e.g.) contour cultivation:. . vetiver grass. _ . \nimproved technology to terraced lands6’ and more* appropriate land. tenure policies.. . \ngovernment subsidies to develop and improve low return farming activities maybe the \nonly way ‘to reduce poverty in these regions” [World Bank (1990)]. This approach \nfocuses more on what the TAC report terms “marginal areas” and seems to ignore the fact \nthat land c$gradation can easily affect the green revolution ‘and other high productivity \nareas also . \nDespite the fact that some argue that regions with marginal climates and soils are not \nrewarding to biophysical scientists and that there is not much scope for research on \ncontours and terraces there seems to be considerable scope for agricultural research \nespecially in the social science .aspects. The impact of agricultural research is larger \nwhere both the severity of poverty and the number of poor are accounted for [ICARDA \n(1997)]. The development community, as exemplified by the World Bti [Walton \n(1997)] and TAC pelson et al. (1997)], is seeking to move from counting the poor to \nunderstanding processes a;nd relationships and to documenting strategies that work. ’ . \nThe work of the International Agricultural Research Centers can contribute significantly \nin several ways to poverty alleviatiori and simultaneous natural resource management. \nThese strategies include efforts to develop technologies that simultaneously improve \nproductivity and natural resource management that use low-cost inputs that the poor can . \nafford and apply; continuing to focus on developing resource-management practices that \nconserve soil, water and vegetation and do not decrease productivity. It includes \nstrategies that focus on developing and disseminating more diversified farming systems \nthat reduce economic risk, contribute to greater resource use efficiency and .provide \nhigher returns to the farm community and continuing to focus on improved vertical \nintegration from producers to consumers, including enhanced quality and added value of \nfarm products,’ improved post harvest processing and storage, and employment generation \n[e.g., ICARDA (1997)]. \nThese strategies call for the integration of research an commodity improvement with the \nconservation and management of natural resources. This h’as long been recdgnized as one \nGS l \nIn dry land areas gains will commonly arise more from improvements in physical structure leading to \nenhanced’ soil moisture levels and retention [Shaxson (1992)] than from the reduction of soil nutrient \ngses, although the latter are importtnt, [Stocking (1986)]. \nI am thankful to Ted Herrzell, formerly of TAC for highlighting this distinction. \n32 \nof the major organizational challenges facing the future of international agricultural \nresearch.” \nSeveral lessons reported in the Crosson and Anderson (1993) study are relevant to the \nagenda setting for policy research within this framework of integrating research on \ncommodity improvement with conservation and management of natural resources \n(NRM). Specifically: \nIf input policies and institutions are weak and the success of commodity research \ndepends on purchased inputs then NRM research might be a better investment than \ncommodity research; \nIf commodity research and NRM research are complementary then poor policies and \nweak institutions lower the return to both kinds of research; \nResearch to find ways to reduce off-farm losses caused by on-farm practices will only \nbe used if farmers benefit from the solutions deveioped; \nAttacking some problems such as downstream effects of soil erosion at the farm level \nmay not be the most efficient solution. It may be more efficient to increase \nproductivity on the farm and find other technical and institutional means to reduce the \ndamages of sediment downstream. \nTAC (1997) indicates four cases of NRM where the System should concentrate its \nresources because user incentives are weakest there. These are cases where: \nl Benefits accrue over a long time, \nl Benefits accrue remotely, \nl Benefits are relatively difficult to identify, and \nl Benefits accrue to different persons than those who bear the cost of management. \nTAC (1997) also highlights the criteria for assessing the relative importance of the \nsubstance of proposals for NRM research in the CGIAR system. Its first criterion is that \nthe research should contribute to poverty alleviation and environmental prot:ection and/or \nenhancement. Answers to several questions identified by Scherr (1998) can help to clarify \nprocess of priority setting in the area of poverty and land degradation. Specifically \nanswers to questions such as: \nWho are the principal resource users ? What are their actual (as opposed to \ntheoretical) incentives for investment and dis-investment in important natural \nresources? What are the farmer’s and the community’s perceptions of resource \ndegradation? What is their understanding of the ecological processes involved \nwhen production systems change or their strategies of adapting to degradation \nchange? What is the empirical evidence of resource degradation at the farm, \ncommunity and regional levels, and the realistic estimates of the costs and \nbenefits of resource rehabilitation for the different actors? \n70 \nsee the March 1993 Report of the Center Director’s Working Group on Ecoregional Approach (Annex \n1, p.3) \n33 \ncan greatly facilitate effective policy making. \nEffective policy agendas, as Crosson and Anderson (1993) stress, need to be built on \nrealism and should avoid the tendency to “reinvent another wheel for which there is no \ndemand.” \nPrecise measurement and rigorous analysis are necessary to understand fully the \nprocesses of poverty and land degradation. For effective extrapolation and prediction it is \nimportant to build up from several rigorous case studies of household decision making \nbased on multi-year panel data sets that include specific land quality and use modules. \n34 \nREFERENCES \nAdams, R. 1995.

Apart from the selection of poverty line the measurement of poverty generally \nfocuses on computing three indices. These reflect: \n4 The prevalence or incidence of poverty as measured by the fraction in the \ntotal population living beiow the poverty line i.e. the head-count \nb) The intensity of poverty reflected in the extent to which the income of the \npoor lies below the poverty line, as measured by the differences between the \ntwo i.e. the poverty gap; \n4 The degree of inequality among the poor, in such a way that income \ntransfers from the worse off among the poor to the less poor should raise \nmeasured poverty and vice versa i.e. the severity ofpoverty irzdex. \nFoster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984) have suggested a useful general index that \nmeets these requirements. Their class of poverty indices takes the following form: \nwhere Z, denotes the poverty line, Y, the expenditure or income of the i-th poor household \n(or individual), N the total number of households and q the number of households whose \nexpenditures or incomes are below the poverty line. \nThis index is based on measuring the gap between the poverty line and the \nexpenditure or income of the poor as a fraction of the poverty line [Z, .- YJ / Zp , raising it \nto a power a and then summing over all poor units. Not only does the index take into \naccount the prevalence and intensity of poverty, it may also be used to reflect the degree of \ninequality among the poor by varying the value of the a parameter. \nThus, if a=O, index P, becomes: P, = q/N, which has been referred to as the head- \ncount index. It reflects the proportion of total population lying below the poverty line, i.e., \nthe proportion of poor in the total population. This measure is indifferent to the extent of \npoverty of the poor. It is only sensitive to their number and reflects the prevalence of \npoverty. \nAlternatively, with a = 1, the poverty index P, becomes: \nPI = + $ [Zp-Yil/Zp = IpO \nI I \nwhere I is the “income gap ratio”, i.e., the mean income gap of the poor \n(Z, - Y) - where ? = C Yi / q is the mean expenditure (income) of the poor expressed as \na fraction of poverty line. Thus, P1 is the income gap ratio multiplied by the head-count \nindex. This index, gives a good measure of the extent or intensity of poverty as it reflects \nhow far the poor are from the poverty line. It may also be used to show the amount of \n49 \nincome, under perfect targeting, that needs to be transferred to the poor to close the poverty \ngap in order to eradicate poverty. However, Pt is insensitive to income distribution among \nthe poor. Income transfers between the poor will leave P1 unchanged. For this to be \nreflected in the index, greater weight has to be given to the poorest units. This can be \nachieved by setting a = 2. \nIf a = 2, the poverty index becomes” \nPl = i $ CZp-Yi)/Zp12 \nI 1 \nP, is the mean squared proportionate poverty gap. This index is not easy to interpret \nas compared to PO and P1, however, it has the advantage of reflecting the degree of \ninequality among the poor, in the sense that the greater the inequality of distribution among \nthe poor and thus the severity of poverty, the higher is P,. \nThis class of poverty indices is additive, it permits the summing up of poverty \nindices for various subgroups in the population. \n“Lipton M. and Jacques van der Gaag. 1993.

"Over the last decade, the avian influenza virus, H5N1, has spread across most of Asia and Europe and parts of Africa. In some countries – including Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Egypt – the avian disease has probably become endemic. There has, as yet, been no human pandemic, although 245 deaths have been reported since 2003. A major international response has been launched, backed by over $2 billion of public money. Huge numbers of poultry have been culled, vaccination campaigns have been implemented and markets have been restructured. These efforts have affected the livelihoods and businesses of millions. In addition, substantial efforts have been invested in improving human and animal health systems, combined with major investments in drug and vaccine development. Detailed contingency and preparedness plans have been devised in case a pandemic occurs.\r\n\r\nThis paper asks: what lessons can we learn from this experience, and what does this mean for future efforts to respond to emerging infectious diseases under the One World, One Health initiative? The paper explores three core narratives that have shaped the response: one focuses on veterinary issues, another on human public health and a third on pandemic preparedness. All have common characteristics, emphasising outbreak control and containment. Missing dimensions are identified, including a lack of attention to underlying disease drivers, issues of poverty and equity and broader questions of access and governance. The paper examines how discourses of security and risk pervade the discussions, affecting how the response has played out. The paper concludes with a discussion of the emerging challenges, including the implications for organisational architectures, professional training and programme implementation.ESR"

INTRODUCTION\nOn June 11th 2008 another outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) \nwas reported in Hong Kong – the site of the first reported human deaths from this \nvirus in 1997. Media reports portrayed the possibility of a major catastrophe. Anxious \ncitizens stopped eating chicken. With China hosting the Olympics in a matter of \nweeks, concerns were raised in the highest circles about the consequences of an \noutbreak – for world profile and for business. Politicians wanted firm action. On \nJune 20th, officials proposed a package of US$128 million to put the small-scale \npoultry sector and wet markets out of business. Traders have rejected the proposal, \nand many consumers argue that the alternative frozen supermarket chickens are \nnot what they want. Others argue that attempts at regulating imports and banning \nwet markets are futile. Informal, unregulated trade abounds, and with South China \nbeing a known, if poorly reported, hot spot of avian influenza virus circulation, the \nchances of keeping Hong Kong free of the disease are very small indeed. Yet, \nsceptics argue that the proposed measures are more about political grandstanding \nand public relations than sensible, science-based control policies. They argue that \nthe net consequences for farmers’, traders’ and poorer consumers’ livelihoods \nwill be negative, with only the well-connected large suppliers and supermarkets \nbenefiting. But, given the fears around viral mutation into a form capable of efficient \nhuman-to-human transmission, others conclude that precaution, even if drastic, is \nthe most appropriate route1. \nThis example highlights the complex trade-offs involved in policy processes around \navian influenza. These are intensely political, pitting different interests and groups \nof actors against each other. Public image, business interests and poor people’s \nlivelihoods are all involved in a complex mix. And the science often is so uncertain \nthat firm decisions based on exact predictions and precise measures are impossible. \nJudgements – normally political judgements – are made, and these are necessarily \nhighly contextual. Media pressure, political effectiveness, implementation capacity \nand geopolitical positioning all come into the picture. \nThus, in order to understand the politics of the international policy response to \navian influenza, we must explore an intersecting story of virus genetics, ecology \nand epidemiology with economic, political and policy machinations in a variety of \nplaces – from Hong Kong to Washington, to Jakarta, Cairo, Rome and London. \nThis paper offers one, necessarily partial and incomplete, view of the story over \n1 Economist June 28 2008, http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_\nid=11622415; see http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm\n1\nthe last decade – and particularly the last few years when over $2 billion of public \nfunds have been mobilised. It is a fascinating and important story. It is important \nbecause the HPAI story is seen by many as a ‘dress rehearsal’ for a major pandemic \nemerging from a zoonotic disease, whereby a combination of viral genetic change \nand ecological circumstance results in transmission of a new disease among \nhumans, with devastating consequences. The 1918 human influenza pandemic \nkilled at least 50 - 100 million people globally2. Estimates for future pandemics vary \nwidely, but a simple calculation sees three times that number given the world’s \nincreased population3. And we are of course in the midst of the catastrophic \npandemic of HIV/AIDS which had its origins as a zoonosis, and which, for a range \nof reasons, was not spotted early enough and spread widely. Between 1940 and \n2004 over 300 new infectious diseases emerged, some 60 per cent of which were \nzoonoses from animals4. That a pandemic influenza strain has not yet emerged \nfrom the H5N1 virus currently circulating, at least at the time of writing this paper, \nis no reason for complacency. An influenza pandemic will happen, it is argued \nconvincingly - some time, somewhere - and we had better be ready for it. For this \nreason, exploring the successes and failures of the avian influenza response to \ndate is an important task. \nThe avian influenza response story is fascinating because it offers insights into some \nwider dilemmas surrounding animal health, production and trade, public health, \nemergency responses and long-term development, and the global governance of \nall of these. As with many high-profile policy debates, there are multiple, competing \npolicy formulae and diverse, sometimes conflicting, intervention responses. There \nare a vast range of actors, associated with numerous networks, often cutting \nacross sectoral boundaries, public/private divides and local, national and global \nsettings. Avian influenza has caused a massive mobilisation of public funds, \ninvolving numerous agencies and resulting in countless initiatives, programmes \nand projects. Yet there has been often remarkable collaboration across what had \npreviously been deep organisational and professional divides. There has also been \na range of organisational innovation and experimentation. These offer important \ninsights into what to do – and indeed what not to do – in the future. \nIn other words, the avian influenza response offers some important perspectives \non some of the ‘big issues’ of the moment. These include, for example, how to \nrespond to uncertain threats which have transnational implications; how to cut \nacross the emergency-development divide, making sure crises result in longer \nterm responses as well as dealing with immediate needs; how to balance interests \nand priorities between ensuring health and safety as well as livelihoods; how to \noperate effectively in a complex multilateral system, within and beyond the UN; \nwhat a commitment to ‘security’ in health and livelihoods really means in practice; \nand much, much more. \nThese are of course all massive, and highly contentious, issues, and this paper will \nnot provide any neat and tidy answers. What it aims to do instead is, through an \nanalytical lens which looks at the politics of policy processes, shed light on these \nissues, sharpening the questions raised and the trade-offs implied. As the global \navian influenza response moves towards a bigger, overarching ‘One World, One \nHealth’ agenda, focusing on the intersections of animal, human and ecosystem \nhealth proposed at the December 2007 Delhi inter-ministerial meeting5 and being \nelaborated for the 2008 Sharm El-Sheikh international ministerial conference, \nthese issues become even more pertinent. We are interested in asking: given the \nlessons of the international response to date, what should be the features of an \neffective, equitable and resilient response infrastructure at the international level? \nIn essence, what should a ‘One World, One Health’ initiative look like in practice?\n2. THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE: 1997-2008\nThere has now been more than a decade of experience since the Hong Kong avian \ninfluenza H5N1 outbreak of 1997 when 18 people were infected and six died. Since \n2003 245 people are reported to have died from infection with this virus across the \nworld, with mortalities highly concentrated in a few countries, mostly in South East \nAsia6. The avian virus has spread across most of Asia and Europe, with regular, \nusually seasonally-defined, outbreaks in poultry. In some countries – and the list \nvaries, but always includes Indonesia, China and Egypt – the disease has become \nendemic among bird populations. In response to these outbreaks over two billion \npoultry have been culled, affecting the livelihoods and businesses of millions7. \nThus, while a major human pandemic has thankfully not occurred, the disease and \nthe consequences of the resulting policy interventions have been far reaching and, \nin certain contexts for certain people, dramatic. Figure 1 offers a map of the spread \nof the virus across the world.\n2 Johnson and Müller (2002). As the iconic event of the past century, around which much media and \npolicy discussion has centred, the 1918 pandemic has been the subject of intense research, ranging \nfrom social histories to technical assessments (cf. Morens and Facui 2007; Taubenberger and \nMorens, 2006; Taubenberger et al 2005).\n3 Murray et al (2007) offer a more sophisticated analysis.\n4 See, for example: Woolhouse 2008; Jones et al, 2008; Webster et al 2007; Woolhouse and \nGaunt 2007; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Woolhouse et al, 2006; Webster 2002.\n5 See Wildlife Conservation Society 2004, http://www.wcs.org/sw-high_tech_tools/\nwildlifehealthscience/owoh  for an early exposition of the ‘One World, One Health’ concept.

How then has \na miniscule virus, made up of a few strands of RNA and a protein coating which \nmight, or might not, have a devastating impact on human populations, influenced \npolicy and practice globally? Appendix 1 shows two timelines stretching over the \nperiod since 1997, with a number of key moments identified. \nBiological, economic and policy processes are mutually intertwined, co-constructing \nthe response. Epidemiological processes of spread – through wild birds, trade or \npoor market hygiene – are influenced by policies which result in mass culls of \npoultry, banning wet markets, or imposing import regulations. In different settings \nthese measures may restrict spread – or actually increase it, as they drive activities \nunderground. What has happened in practice is highly dependent on the way \ndifferent contexts affect this interplay between biology, economic interests and \npolicy. In some parts of the world – notably in Europe, but also in Thailand, Hong \nKong, and, for a time, Vietnam – policies have influenced disease incidence \nand spread in ways that have seen intermittent outbreaks being controlled and \nmanaged increasingly effectively. In other places, this has not been the case, \nand the disease has become endemic, with regular outbreaks occurring, and little \nlikelihood of eliminating the virus8. In terms of the global policy response, it is the \nformer context – of controlled virus and stamping out of intermittent outbreaks – \nthat has dominated thinking and practice, while the latter context – of an endemic \ndisease situation – has been largely ignored – or denied. \nAs figure 2 highlights, concerns in many quarters rose as the disease spread from \nisolated outbreaks in South East Asia – first to central Asia, then to Europe and \nAfrica. The speech by US President George Bush in September 2005 to the United \nNations indicated strongly that the US was taking this very seriously9. In the post \n9/11 world where threats to US homeland security could arise from terrorism and \ninfectious disease – and potentially deadly combinations of the two – the spectre of \na major pandemic rang alarm bells. As a US government official put it. \nFigure 1. Confirmed occurrence of H5N1 in poultry and wild birds since 2003\nIn the wake of 9/11 scenario and the transformation of the institutional response \ncapability within the US, we were looking at a sort of all hazards approach, and how \nthe White House sees that with homeland security, it was kind of natural to see this \npotential threat in a broader context and to respond to it in a fairly robust manner… \nAlso the sensitivity to criticism that came out of Katrina lent the whole White House \nfocus a sharp edge. We don’t want to be criticised like that again so we really need \nto do a good job on this… It is one of our high priorities because this is a presidential \ninitiative and the president has an interest in what is going on…there’s the White \nHouse, the Homeland Security Council, that’s a sort of national security council, and \nthey’ve had the primary lead, and it’s a real lead. If something happens it’s homeland \nsecurity. It’s very much in a security framework10.\n8 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007a); Sims (2007).\n9 http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050914.html\n10 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\nFigure 2. The international avian influenza response: an actor-network diagram\n54\nAn unforgiving electorate, an anxious population and a media that fed off ever more \nterrifying disaster scenarios was a potent mix. The UN was concerned too. What \nwould happen if an influenza pandemic really did occur? How would national and \ninternational systems cope – and how would the UN respond? Across Asia, Europe \nand the US there was very real concern: “Governments thought a pandemic \nwas around the corner. Really, ASEAN heads of government were particularly \nconcerned”12. Concerns were also being raised by country officials, as well as \nUN, World Bank and other agency staff based particularly in south-east Asia. This \nprovoked high level discussions among the Deputy UN Secretary General and the \nthen Secretary General, and David Nabarro was appointed ‘UN System Influenza \nCoordinator’ in September 2005. Estimates of huge potential mortalities made at \nthe time of his appointment provoked a major furore among the technical agencies, \nbut it certainly resulted in the raising of the profile of the issue among a wider \nconstituency, moving the debate from concerns at the ‘periphery’ right to the centre \nof the global system13. This was accelerated by the arrival of H5N1 in Europe and \nhuman cases in Turkey in January 2006. The possibility of a major pandemic looked \nto be potentially just around the corner. \nBut there was not one single political motivation for action. Different pressures and \ninfluences arose on different sides of the Atlantic. In the US, as already mentioned, \nthe ‘homeland security’ and ‘bioterror’ angle was critical. But so was, according \nto some, lobbying from pharmaceutical business interests, keen to create new \nmarket opportunities from the avian influenza crisis. This dynamic took a different \ncomplexion in Europe, however. As one informant argued:\n11 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\n12 David Nabarro, review comment, August 2008.\n13 Bird Flu ‘Could Kill 150m People.’  BBC Online 30 September 2005 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/\nworld/asia-pacific/4292426.stm\nThe EU, of course, sees harmonisation among member states as key. While market \ndrivers are there, the pharma industry in Europe is more established, stable. They \nare worried about the politics of the Union: the two-speed Europe. Avian influenza \nwas a very useful basis for mending political fences – dealing with the aberrations of \na two-track Europe. Fake urgency helped bring things together. It helped push the \npolitical process forward14.\nSo, while policy narratives were being constructed in the context of ‘big politics’, \nthis intersected with more technical debates. In 2005 a series of models were \nproduced which showed the potential of spread from isolated outbreaks, and the \nimportance of control and containment measures of various sorts (Longini et al \n2005; Ferguson et al 2005). At the same time scientific assessments of the H5N1 \nvirus showed its variability and the potential for rapid change. While couched in \ncautions and provisos, these emerging findings provided further impetus towards a \nconcerted response. Business interests got in the act too. The anti-viral oseltamivir \n(Hoffmann-La Roche’s Tamiflu) was presented as an important stop-gap measure, \nreducing the impact of the virus in infected individuals. Governments quickly \nordered stockpiles and the public sought supplies from any source15. Meanwhile \nvaccine manufacturers went in search of an elusive vaccine solution – one that \nwould deal with seasonal influenzas as well as potential pandemic strains, at least \nuntil a more targeted one could be developed16. \nIn 2005 the new International Health Regulations were published in response to \nthe crisis17. These allowed for direct intervention at source in response to globally \nthreatening disease situations. They also required a more streamlined and \neffective reporting system, building on the successful response following the SARS \noutbreaks of 2002-03. As discussed in more depth below, the IHR 2005 signalled \nan important shift in the international governance of public health issues, with a \nceding of national sovereignty, at least in theory, in the face of a global threat (cf. \nHeymann 2006). \nThe Beijing inter-ministerial pledging conference, held in January 2006, provided \na focus for the growing global effort. US$1.8 billion were pledged, and the main \ntechnical agencies – the UN World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN Food and \nAgriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) \n14 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\n15 http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2005/oct/20/birdflu\n16 see Stöhr and Esveld (2004).\n17 Fidler (2005b).\n18 One plan (A Global Strategy for the Progressive Control of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, \n2005, later revised 2007) focuses on the animal health aspects and was led by FAO and OIE, \nwith inputs from WHO, see: Food and Agriculture Organisation and Organisation International des \nEpizooties (2005); Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007b). Another from WHO (Responding to \nthe Avian Influenza Pandemic Threat: Recommended Strategic Actions) focuses on public health \naspects, see: http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_CSR_GIP_05_\n8-EN.pdf, which is currently under revision.\nAnother continued:\nNow if you are looking at what motivated this I would say it is not a lot of dead \nchickens. It’s fear of a lot of things. There is no question that the high level of interest \nat the highest level of government took place because of the fear of a 1918 style \nepidemic. And I’ve been at meetings in the White House where it was said that the \nscenario of 1918 was not necessarily the worst case - mortality, morbidity and so on. \nSo what drove this? I think we just have to be frank – it is the fear of a severe human \npandemic…. No matter how much we prepare there are huge concerns out there \nand electorates can be very unforgiving…. There are limits to how much you can do \nto prevent these kinds of things from happening. The limits changed for us on 9/11. \nNow we are a lot more concerned about terrorism, but you could argue that it still is \nnot enough if you want to have perfect security. It’s the same with preparing for a \npandemic. You can always put more in. But governments have to make decisions, \nthey have to manage risks, and I think this is a risk that the US government, possibly \nmore than any other government, has accentuated to the world. This is a serious risk \nwe have to prepare for11.\n76\n– came up with a series of plans and strategies prepared for the conference18. \nWhilst the issue had been live before, it was at this point that the ambitions and \nactivities of the international response significantly scaled up. This has taken many \nforms in different places.\nMuch of the core work has focused on the veterinary response, controlling \n‘at source’ with the aim of both reducing socio-economic impacts on poultry \nproduction as well as reducing human exposure. As veterinarians argued, dealing \nwith avian influenza was not new. They had standard approaches to controlling \ndisease outbreaks which had been tried and tested over many years. What they \nneeded now was more support for doing what they knew how to do already. Thus, \nas discussed below, standard culling, compensation, vaccination and market \nrestructuring programmes were initiated in line with OIE and FAO guidelines. On \nthe human public health side, programmes focused on drug and vaccine supply \nand delivery were combined with large scale public education and communication \nprogrammes to reduce infection and transmission risks, led by WHO and UNICEF, \ntogether with a range of NGOs19. In addition, human pandemic preparedness plans \nwere developed across the world, with 109 country plans completed (if not tested) \nby the end of 200720. In different sectors and across agencies, scenarios were \ndeveloped and contingency plans were tested, with UN agencies – UNOCHA (now \nincorporating PIC) and WFP in particular – often taking the lead.  \nIn sum, there has been a huge amount of activity, and considerable expenditure \nof resources – totalling way beyond the formal pledged commitments if the wider \ncosts incurred by private companies and industry groups are included in the totals. \nThis has involved large numbers of people, spread across diverse organisations \nin all parts of the world. What can we learn from all this? This paper does not \naim to offer a detailed description of what, where and when, but to probe into the \nunderlying rationales and drivers of different policies and actions. Understanding \nthe policy process involves asking a series of interrelated questions (cf. Keeley and \nScoones 2003): \n19 World Health Organization (2005) (2006) (2007).\n20 http://www.un-pic.org/PIC/pages/report_overall.aspx\n21 Policy narratives are stories told in policy debates. They have clear beginnings (defining the \nproblem), middles (expanding on the context and challenges) and ends (elaboration of solutions). \nu First, what are the narratives – the storylines21 – which define the way the disease \nproblem is understood and the way the response has unfolded? In other words, \nhow are both problems and solutions framed, and through what mechanisms?\nu Second, who are the actors involved in these narratives and how are they linked? How \ndo they align – or not – with the main policy narratives being promoted? And how do \nthey align with different interests – professional, organisational, political, commercial? \n3. ACTORS, NETWORKS AND NARATIVES: \nUNPACKING THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE\nThe international response has been dominated by what might be termed an \noverarching ‘outbreak narrative’ (cf. Wald 2008). This has a number of recurrent \nfeatures which, in turn, create a particular style of policy and politics. A central \nfeature is public fear and worry which permeates public and media debates. This \noften involves the construction of ‘the other’ – dangerous places and people \nfrom where diseases come from, and something to be feared. Another feature of \noutbreak narratives focuses on western anxieties about globalisation – that we are \nall connected, and can all be affected, by diseases or other disasters that spread \nacross the globe. In addition, there is often an assumption that outbreaks emerge \nfrom disrupted, primordial settings which are pushed ‘out of equilibrium’. This is \nlinked to concerns about protecting the conditions of modernity, where disease is \ncontrolled, unlike in the primitive, backward, unregulated contexts where diseases \nemerge. Cutting through all of this is a politics of control and enforcement by the \nstate – or global bodies with state-like characteristics – that at once constructs \nand justifies imposition and authority – by authorised, sanctioned expertise or, \nat the extreme, military-style force. All of these features of ‘outbreak narratives’ \n(Wald 2008) are present in the avian influenza experience. Understanding how \nthese ways of thinking, talking and presenting ideas in public, academic and policy \ndiscourse is essential to unravelling how particular policy processes in particular \nplaces emerge.\n \nIn today’s world, of course, the media – in all its forms – has a major role to play \nin constructing these biopolitics22, and so framing the narratives and practices of \nresponse.  At the peak of the HPAI crisis, the global media had a field day23. Feeding \nu Third, in this process and over time, what policy spaces open up – and what \nspaces are closed down? What moments of debate, dispute and dissent exist – \nover what and between whom? And how do these spaces (or lack of them) affect \nwhat can be done?\nu Finally, overall, we want to ask who wins and who loses through these processes? \nWhose version wins out, whose gets excluded, and why? And what other narratives, \nactors and interests exist with different perspectives, and how might these have \ninfluence in framing a future One World, One Health initiative?\n22 Following Foucault, biopower involves the application and impact of power on human life and \nthe body, with biopolitics being the intersection of politics and the life sciences (Rose 2006), see: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolitics\n98\non a climate of fear, anxiety and uncertainty in the post 9/11 world, journalists \ncould construct some dire storylines. These were replete with disaster metaphors, \nconjuring up a politics of fear and blame. In tracing this process up to mid 2005, \nNerlich and Halliday (2007) identify an article on human-human transmission in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine in January 2005 as a key trigger (Ungchusak \net al 2005). This was accompanied by an editorial by Klaus Stöhr (2005), then \nCoordinator of the Global Influenza Programme of the WHO, that was picked \nup by the New Scientist and the British Medical Journal the same week. These \nnarratives of fear were of course reinforced by the speculative predictions and \nprojections about potential mortalities, and the doomsday picture painted of \ncollapsed economies, dying millions and a very personal, individual struggle to get \nhold of vaccines, drugs or safety equipment. So for example from around the time \nof Nabarro’s September 2005 appointment the following are a small sample of the \ntop headlines, all in reputable publications:\n‘On a wing and a prayer’: Millions of people killed in highly developed countries within \nmonths. Tens of millions worldwide. The global economy in tatters. A Hollywood \nfantasy? No – it’s now a plausible scenario. The first act, the spread of avian flu \nto, and probably between, humans, has already started across Asia. Unless the \ninternational community now moves decisively to mitigate this pandemic threat, we \nwill in all probability pay heavily within a few years. Then, hard questions will be asked \nas to why we were not prepared24.\n‘Bird flu ‘could kill 150m people: Experts fear birds will carry the virus across borders’. \nA flu pandemic could happen at any time and kill between 5-150 million people, a \nUN health official has warned. David Nabarro, who is charged with co-ordinating \nresponses to bird flu, said a mutation of the virus affecting Asia could trigger new \noutbreaks. “It’s like a combination of global warming and HIV/Aids 10 times faster \nthan it’s running at the moment,” Dr Nabarro told the BBC25. \n‘Bush seeks military option on bird flu’: President Bush, stirring debate on the \nworrisome possibility of a bird flu pandemic, suggested dispatching American troops \nto enforce quarantines in any areas with outbreaks of the killer virus. Bush asserted \naggressive action could be needed to prevent a potentially crippling US outbreak \nof a bird flu strain that is sweeping through Asian poultry and causing specialists to \nfear it could become the next deadly pandemic. Citing concern that state and local \nauthorities might be unable to contain such an outbreak, Bush asked Congress to \ngive him the authority to call in the military26.\nThis only touches the surface. The blogosphere and the Internet discussion sites \noffer another whole dimension. Here conspiracy theories and dire scenarios abound \n– and feed off each other, in a frenzy of outbreak narratives of many sorts27. \nWhile of course it is impossible to attribute cause and effect in complex policy \nprocesses, many people commented to us that the media, and popular books on \nthe subject, have had an impact on the framing of the policy debate. US President \nGeorge Bush had reputedly been influenced by the book ‘The Great Influenza: \nThe Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History’ by John Barry, while another well-\nread popular book, ‘The Coming Plague’ by Laurie Garrett, together with pieces \nin National Geographic, Newsweek and Time magazine, added to the deluge \nof commentary. In science-policy circles the coordinated publication of special \nissues by Foreign Affairs and Nature in 2005 added to the waves of interest and \nconcern. A Foreign Affairs comment piece by Michael Osterholm, director of the \nCenter for Infectious Disease Policy and Research at the University of Minnesota, \nwas particularly well read (Osterholm 2005a)28. That the technical debate in the \nscientific journals of Cell, Science or Nature offered a more circumspect, uncertain \nand confused story, with highly conflicting models and predictions, did not really \nmatter too much29. Headlines matter and policies almost necessarily have to follow \na simple narrative storyline – beginning, middle, end; if this is the problem, then \nthis is the solution. News coverage, and so political profile, does matter, across \nthe spectrum of actors involved in the avian influenza response. The technical \nagencies are not immune. While they argue that it is only the science that justifies \ntheir position, the fact that an issue on their patch is in the media spotlight has \nconsequences for profile, exposure and, ultimately, funding.  \n23 For example, a timeline search of the Google News archive reveals the patterns of press \ninterest since January 2004.\n24 Nature 435, 385-386 26 May 2005 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/pdf/\n435385a.pdf \n25 BBC ONLINE: Friday, 30 September 2005 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-\npacific/4292426.stm\n26 The Boston Globe: By Jennifer Loven, Associated Press, October 5, 2005.\n27 Here is a sample from the blogosphere: “We are playing musical chairs. 300 million people and \n3 million chairs”, quote by NS1; “Attempting to prepare the US for a pandemic by making specific \nrecommendations for the government to implement is like trying to cure anaemia by bleeding the \npatient. The cure for what ails this culture is more self-reliance; we aren’t going to get there by \nhaving the government do things we ought to do for ourselves”, quote by LMWatBullRun; “It will \ntake more than ‘good men’ to get us out of this JIT jam. Those good men at the top must also \nbe courageous, smart, informed, and lucky. We face the two most formidable opponents in all \nof recorded history - an urbanized human race with all of its current psycho-social weaknesses \nand a developing panflu that more than likely will sputter to life with breadth and depth”, quote \nby Medical Maven; “Fail to plan = plan to fail. Each of us to some extent is planning for the \npandemic, but BROTHER are most of the rest planning to fail! Folks have talked about calling \nthis the “Black Flu” or the “China Flu” or the “Boyd Flu”. I may start talking about the “Ellie Flu” \nafter ‘Deep Impact’, y’know where they’re talking about ELE- Extinction Level Event...Maybe it \nwould more accurately be the CEE flu - Civilization Ending Event”, quote by LMWatBullRun.

The responses have \ncentred on veterinary control measures and industry ‘restructuring’, with the OIE \nand FAO being at the centre of the actor-network.\nu Second, a human public health narrative which certainly dominated the media \nand political concerns: “human-human spread is the real risk, and could be \ncatastrophic”. Here a combination of drugs, vaccines and behaviour change were \nseen to dominate the response, one very much centred on the WHO, with UNICEF \nand a number of NGOs being important players too.\nu Third, a narrative focused on pandemic preparedness: “a major economic and \nhumanitarian disaster is around the corner and we must be prepared”. Responses \nfocus on civil contingency planning, business continuity approaches and \ncontainment strategies. Here, a much wider network of business/industry players \nand consultants are concerned, linked to different branches of government, notably \nprime ministers’/presidents’ offices and finance ministries with concerns about the \nfallout of any pandemic. The humanitarian community – UN agencies, the Red \nCross, development NGOs and others – are also important.\nSuch narratives compete for attention in the policy process. One informant put it \nsuccinctly: “We’ve got David Nabarro drawing a picture of a spectre that is going to \nengulf the world, and you’ve got vets saying ‘you can say anything you like, but it is \nabout chickens”30 . Figure 2 offers a diagrammatic interpretation of the constellation \nof actors involved in the international response. Clearly there are more actors than \nthis, especially those only tangentially engaged, but this diagram is our attempt \nto map out the actor network based on the extensive interviews undertaken. Our \nstudy has primarily focused on the international public response and so underplays \nthe array of actors and interactions within the private sector.\nIn subsequent sections each of these actors and their associated networks will \nbe introduced. At this broader level, however, the diagram offers an insight into a \nnumber of important features, pertinent to our broader analysis:\nu Actors coalesce around the three core outbreak narratives described above. These \nare distinct actor networks, associated with some lead agencies and key people. But \nthey are not wholly separate: they come together in a number of important bridging \nIn different ways, then, an outbreak narrative dominated across a range of actors \nand networks. In the context of the avian influenza response, not just one outbreak \nnarrative, but three were important. Each is associated with a particular grouping \nof people, professions and processes. In the next sections of this paper we look at \nthe following trio:\n30 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.\norganisations. On technical issues, the nexus around WHO, FAO, UNICEF and \nOIE is of course important, with UNSIC playing a key coordinating role, particularly \non financial and wider policy issues. On financing, the World Bank has come to \nplay quite an important, bridging role too. \nu The diagram highlights the sheer number of initiatives – and associated acronyms \n– that the HPAI response has either spawned or expanded. While no new big \ncoordinating body has been established, as with UNAIDS, it is striking how many \ninitiatives cluster around the core organisations at the centre of the diagram; as \nsomeone put it “like bees around the honey pot”.\nu The cluster of actors around ‘the media’ and ‘politics’ hovers in the corner, but \nis in practice all pervasive. Different responses to the media and different styles \nof politics are important, but this dimension has been a persistent and important \nfeature – both in raising the profile of the issue (and so resources) and in the \nconcerns about how, without any major outbreak, the issue seems to be going ‘off \nthe radar’ again, with declining media and political interest.\nu There are a number of actors who appear on the periphery of the diagram: not well \nconnected to the core players, nor particularly associated with the core narratives. \nThese include a number of NGO players who, in different ways, have been critical \nof the mainstream framing of the debates, around livelihoods and development and \nimplications for the poultry industry in the case of GRAIN31, and around intellectual \nproperty and virus sharing in the case of the Third World Network32. We also have a \nsmall circle, but representing a very large group, who have had very little influence \non the debate so far at all: small-scale poultry producers, particularly in virus-\naffected countries in Asia. These, among others, are the marginalised actors who \nframe the debate in different ways, and offer usually unheard alternative narratives. \nSection 7 will return to an examination of this group.\n31 GRAIN Briefing. (2006). ‘Fowl Play - The Poultry Industry’s Central Role In The Bird Flu Crisis.’ \nfrom www.grain.org/go/birdflu.\n32 http://www.twnside.org.sg/\nAn earlier diagram was prepared in the scoping phase of this project (see Scoones \nand Forster 2007), based on a review of documents and Internet source material \navailable at the time. This helped us identify our starting points for carrying out \nmore detailed interviews. These snowballed out from initial discussions with FAO, \nWHO and OIE to a range of organisations in Europe and North America. In total we \nhad interviews with 63 people across a range of organisations (see Appendix 2). \nThese have deepened and nuanced our analysis of the politics of policy process, \nextending our insights and attentions beyond the initial focus. As a very time \ndelimited study, however, we could not cover everything and everybody. Given our \nfocus on the international response, we have focused more on global institutions \nand their headquarters, rather than in-country experiences. This study is, however, \n1312\nbeing complemented by detailed country studies in Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand \nand Vietnam, where we are looking at the international response from the other \nend of the telescope33. We have also focused in particular on the main technical \nagencies at the heart of the response, notably WHO, FAO, OIE, together with \nUNICEF, UNOCHA and others, as well as the coordinating efforts of UNSIC and \nothers, including the World Bank. While this front-line work is the most visible, there \nhas of course been substantial back-up support from different funding agencies, \nnotably the European Commission, USAID and other bilateral donor governments, \nmany of whom we talked to. However, what follows is necessarily qualified and \npartial, but hopefully useful, in particular in identifying challenges for the future. \nIn the next sections, we will first examine the three main ‘outbreak narratives’ and \nhow these have framed the debate, looking at what was proposed, what happened, \nand the tensions, dilemmas and trade-offs that have arisen. We will then move on to \nlook at three alternative narratives, which have often been obscured or silenced by \nthe mainstream debate, but which each have important implications for the future. \nFollowing this, we move to an analysis of some cross-cutting themes: institutional \nand organisational architectures, the role of expertise in the context of uncertainty \nand ignorance; and the (multiple) meanings and interpretations of security and the \nimplications for ‘global governance’. Each of these themes – and the analysis of the \nfindings as a whole – has important implications for the future – and in particular \nwhat a ‘One World, One Health’ approach might look like. \n4. VETS AND VIRUSES:\nTHE ANIMAL HEALTH RESPONSE\nAvian influenza is of course, in the first instance, a bird disease. H5N1 has affected \nbillions of chickens, ducks and other poultry, as well as wild birds. For this reason \nthe animal health sector legitimately argued that this was their territory. They had \nlong dealt with avian influenza and Newcastle disease, a similar viral infection. \nThus veterinarians legitimately claimed a place at the table, presenting a strong \n‘birds first’ narrative – arguing that dealing with the disease in its avian form was \nthe best initial step to avoid a human pandemic.\nVeterinarians have a long and distinguished professional tradition. This was their \nmoment in the limelight – and the chance, as many saw it, to show that they \nknew how to stamp out a disease. The veterinary profession is associated with a \nrange of organisations, the apex body being the OIE, an inter-governmental body \nI see avian flu as a chance to get things done we’d do anyway…We can use the \nPVS to position ourselves. Because this is a big crisis we can use it to do things that \nwould be difficult otherwise, to get the money. The OIE sees itself as a big player in \nthe avian influenza crisis34.\nSimilarly, FAO has a long tradition of work in the animal health field, and its Animal \nProduction and Health division is seen as a source of high quality technical advice \nand field support in this area35. Yet these organisations had been, for a long period, \nboth under-funded and under-recognised. As the avian influenza story hit the \nheadlines, those in charge recognised the opportunity both for funds and influence. \nOne senior FAO informant put it:\nThis put FAO really in the front line. We started making noise…The technical options \nare clear. Then there are institutional and policy solutions - we know the elements but \nhow to make them work is difficult36.\n33 See http://www.steps-centre.org/ourresearch/avianflu.html\nwith governments represented through the heads of veterinary services, usually \nthe Chief Veterinary Officer. Avian influenza was a major boon to the veterinary \ncommunity. As one informant commented:\n34 Interview, London, 13 May 2008.\n35 http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/index.html\n36 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.\nThe early period from late 2003 to early 2004 saw some awkward manoeuvring \nbetween individuals and organisations, and some hot politics. Who was going to \nget the lion’s share of the resources? Who was going to have the most influence? \nWhose organisation was going to drive the policy debate? These were difficult \ntimes, as OIE and FAO in particular fought it out. Inevitably strong personalities, \npersonal histories and professional egos had an influence on the dynamics. But in \nthe end, particularly once the Beijing pledging conference had confirmed substantial \nresources (even if some of them were loans and many recycled commitments), \nthings settled down. There was enough to go round. A serious fight was not \nnecessary. Indeed, a memorandum of understanding was confirmed between OIE \nand FAO which demarcated roles and responsibilities in a neat diagram. While \nthe reality was more complex, a working – if occasionally tense – relationship has \nevolved which has enabled the veterinary community, at least in public, to speak \nwith (more or less) one voice.\nHaving a clear and coherent position – structured around a strong and convincing \nnarrative – is essential in any policy process. This took some time coming, but has \neventually emerged. The veterinary narrative essentially argues that the standard \nveterinary response – using a combination of culling, movement control and \nvaccination – to eliminate the disease is all that is required. This is enshrined in the \nOIE guidelines which specify ‘eradication pathways’ for different listed diseases. \nThe reporting systems that are required of national veterinary authorities are ones \n1514\nthat ensure early warning and rapid response, and the challenge is more logistical, \nmanagerial and financial. For this reason, and with much justification, the OIE \nargued that the main investments needed are in the area of boosting the lagging \ncapacity of veterinary services in the developing world, bringing them up to an \nacceptable standard. The PVS (Performance, Vision, Strategy) system developed \nby the OIE37 is the tool that defines what needs to be done, and the next steps are \ninvestment in capacity (labs, personnel training, equipment, vaccines etc.) which \nFAO, World Bank and other agency projects would take on. \nIt was clear, it was simple and it allowed money to be spent. In other words it \nwas a perfect response for the moment. With the Director General of OIE astutely \nmanoeuvring the organisation into the mainstream, his influence in the debate \ngrew substantially and, with this, the central role of professional, government vets. \nBut how did this framing of the problem and response limit and constrain, and in \nsome places, undermine the global effort? The construction of a particular view of \nthe disease (one of poultry, mostly chickens) and how to deal with it (eradication/\nstamping out) reinforced the power and influence of certain individuals and \norganisations to the exclusion of others. The potential of endemicity, and the very \ndifferent response requirements for Africa, for example, were often not considered. \nSimilarly, the field level realities that farmers and field vets faced in places like \nEgypt, Indonesia or Vietnam were not part of the picture. This was a global \nresponse, facilitated by global organisations, with a globally-defined pathway of \ndisease eradication. Although a membership organisation with equal voting rights, \nthe OIE does not have a huge network of field offices. It relies on the reports of the \nCVOs, who are very much behoven to the organisation. The politics of knowledge, \nreporting and accountability are often fraught, with the centre, and its commissions \nand advisory groups, holding sway with debates usually dominated by European \nand North American concerns and interests. Here mass culling and eradication \nfollowing an outbreak made sense – and indeed were imperative and worked in \nTurkey. The uniform manuals, protocols and procedures were thus seen to be the \nanswer and so the ‘outbreak narrative’ dominated both diagnosis and prescription.\nAnother strand of work by animal health specialists, this time mostly from the \nFAO, focused on dealing with the biosecurity of poultry production units and wet \nmarkets. Speculation was rife about the main pathways of spread among poultry \n– was it ‘backyard flocks’ or large industrial units? Was the disease spread through \nunregulated and unhygienic trade or through wild birds? No-one seemed to know \nthe answer and any detailed case analysis suggested that multiple routes were \npossible38. But this uncertainty fed into a more political argument about cause and \nblame. Here different interests, beyond simple scientific concerns, came into play. \nMuch of this centred on a vision of what a safe, modern poultry sector should \nlook like. For many animal health specialists, particularly those from or trained in \n37 http://www.oie.int/downld/Prep_conf_Avian_inf/A_Final_PVS.pdfavianflu.html\n39 See Sims and Narrod (undated) http://www.fao.org/avianflu/documents/key_ai/key_book_\npreface.htm\n39 See, Burgos and Burgos (2007); Beach et al (2007).\n40 See, McLeod (2008), McLeod et al (2006) or Rushton et al (2005), for example.\n41 http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2007/03/avian_flu_report.html\nEurope or North America, small scale poultry production and informal wet markets \nwere seen as backward and in need of modernisation. Surely development, they \nargued, should be about eliminating these practices and assuring high levels of \nhygiene and safety. Powerpoint presentations show ‘before’ and ‘after’ scenes of \nAsian markets that had been ‘restructured’ according to the designs of different \ndevelopment programmes. This became the model of what to do and, as we saw in \nthe opening case study, the approach adopted in Hong Kong and beyond. \nHowever, this approach had its downsides, particularly for poor producers and \nconsumers39. Surely, others argued, development is not just about modernisation \nof production, but also about poverty reduction and improving livelihoods40. As \nplayed out within FAO, for example, this debate often found veterinarians and \nsocio-economists at loggerheads on appropriate ways forward. In the wider debate \nlobby groups pushed hard to ‘prove’ that their constituency were not to blame. Wild \nbird enthusiasts, for example, attempted to demonstrate that it was trade not the \nmigration of wild birds that was at fault41. Advocates of smallholder farming argued \nthat the blame must lie at the door of industrial capitalist production systems. But \nwere these positions based on evidence or more normative positions and personal \npreferences? Until recently at least, it seemed mostly the latter. Evidence that \nwild birds are carriers of H5N1 is widespread, although the causation of particular \noutbreaks often remains uncertain. Most now agree that unregulated large scale \nproduction can be a major biosecurity risk, but many large units equally have top \nquality biosecurity measures and can deal with outbreaks effectively and efficiently. \nBackyard flocks tend not to be significant factors in the spread of disease as they \nare largely kept in limited places and consumed at home, while medium size flocks \nkept in cramped conditions in urban settings appear to present a particular risk, \nalong with unhygienic wet markets. As new research has found, in addition to the \n3Ps (pigs, poultry and people), free grazing ducks in rice cropping areas present a \nparticular challenge in some parts of Asia (Gilbert et al 2007; 2008; Hulse-Post et \nal 2005; Stum-Ramirez et al 2005). \nBut these situations are often highly particular, and dependent on a wide range \nof factors from local ecological ones (such as whether ducks are part of the agro-\necosystem; the migratory routes of wild birds; the proximity to viral ‘hot spots’ and \nso on) to the structure of the industry (the relative importance of large and small \nproduction units and their location), the economics of production (whether poultry \nproduction makes money and what incentives exist to squeeze more chickens \ninto smaller spaces) and the regulatory and policy environment (health and safety \nregulations and their enforceability in markets, movement and trade restrictions \nand so on). In other words, the idea that there is a single ‘before’ and a single ‘after’ \ntechnical or policy solution is impractical, unworkable and possibly dangerous. \n1716\nThe dangers of a simplistic narrative line have come home to roost (to coin a term) \nin a number of places. There seems to be a certain level of denial about this in \nsome quarters. The need to present a success story of the veterinary response \nto keep the money flowing can overwhelm the ability to offer honest, balanced, \nsanguine assessments42. Thus in early 2008 a number of senior officials argued \nthat the viral load was decreasing and that this was a direct result of veterinary \ninterventions. But when probed, the evidence for these claims seemed to be lacking. \nUndoubtedly, successes have been achieved in Turkey and parts of the Balkans, \nbut there are still big problems in Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Egypt, Nigeria, \nVietnam and China (probably the largest global source of the virus), areas referred \nto by some as “the smoking guns”43. But we cannot be entirely sure about these or \nmany other countries because of poor reporting and monitoring and we must not \nforget that the reporting is of outbreaks, not of viral load. Even in Vietnam, a poster-\nchild for intensive vaccination campaigns, the problems of repeated recurrence of \noutbreaks eventually had to be admitted. \nSo a mixed picture was emerging which challenged, in several important respects, \nthe classic outbreak and response narratives so well presented and defended by \nthe animal health sector. What happens when the disease becomes entrenched or \nendemic? This is currently probably the case in six countries worldwide – Indonesia, \nVietnam, Cambodia, China, Egypt and Nigeria44. These are the places where most \noutbreaks are recorded (see figure 1) and where most human deaths occur. Should \na different strategy be in place in these countries? We found it incredibly difficult \nto get an answer to this question. Some reacted defensively, arguing that good \nprogrammes are in place and that eradication remains the aim. Others disputed the \ndefinition of endemism and argued that the existing systems just need to be made \nto work better. Others said it demonstrated the need to do more and build capacity. \nA few, mostly with recent field experience in these countries, were, however, more \nsanguine, saying that they were doing their best, but often simply ‘chasing the \nvirus’. Indonesia was seen as perhaps the most extreme case. As some pointed \nout, the Participatory Disease Surveillance approach had been enormously \nsuccessful, finding the virus virtually everywhere. But how did knowing this affect \nresponses? Here the limits of the standard veterinary response became evident. \nPeople talked of the difficulties of instituting culling campaigns in Sumatra where \ndeep distrust of the state and the veterinary service persisted. They talked of the \nway people hid both themselves and their poultry as soon as a government official \ncame anywhere near. They talked of the difficulties that arose when compensation \nwas either not paid or paid late or inadequately following mass culling procedures \nwith vets in white suits and protective gear. And they talked of the futility of poultry \nbans and market closures in large, unregulated metropolitan cities like Jakarta. \nOne informant reflected: \n42 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007a); (2008a); (2008b).\n43 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.\n44 Although doubts exist about the extent of entrenchment in Nigeria.\nCulling is always contentious. And without an effective compensation strategy you \nalienate people. In endemic situations does it make sense? The OIE approach is very \nmuch ‘first world’ – hordes of white suited professional vets going out, gassing poultry \nand disposing of them. But is this appropriate or realistic?45\nAnother observed:\nA lot of countries remain very underprepared to face avian flu. The immediate response \nis to reach for the OIE guidelines. And the interpretation of these is problematic. In \ndifferent contexts, they may not be appropriate. If you are a very poor country with \nlimited logistical and other resources, culling may not be the answer. But very often \nthey go straight for culling and ring culling…Ring culling assumes that AI is transferred \nthrough the environment, not through chains. The basic conceptual framework at a \ntechnical level is flawed. And the practical, logistical issues are difficult…in Egypt they \nculled, but did not deal with the disposal and cleaning up well. It just made the situation \nas bad. The disease persisted. It is money down the drain, and people distrust you \ntoo…In the panic of trying to respond – to do something, the idea is lost. We are \ntrying to control a disease! The OIE Manual does not take account of the context. The \ncontext must include political, social, economic issues. But none of these are thought \nabout…Culling has been done so badly. It has been so heavy-handed. They go into \na village and wipe out everything. The average villager is scared shitless of the vets \nturning up. The last person they will turn to will be the public sector vet46.\nAnother informant noted the mobilisation against veterinary measures in Lagos, \nNigeria. When a ban on marketing was proposed by the authorities, women traders \nmarched on the government offices, besieging them. The patron of the traders’ \nassociation turned out (apocryphally or not, we are not sure) to be the president’s \nwife. The ban was, not surprisingly, quickly overturned.\nThus political, cultural, social and economic contexts matter. In Indonesia or \nNigeria people have different livelihood concerns, and different perceptions of \nrisk compared both to each other, and certainly to those based in Geneva, Rome \nor Washington. Even in Indonesia, with 112 confirmed human deaths to date, \nthere are other, greater risks and threats to livelihoods – earthquakes, tsunamis, \nfood prices and more. How does a poultry disease – one that seems ‘just like \nNewcastle’ – compete with these concerns in people’s risk framings? And, given \nthe often difficult relation with technicians and agents of the state in many parts of \nthe world, why should the public be expected to agree to their recommendations, \nespecially if they arrive unannounced in a village dressed in protective suits and \nexterminate all their chickens, and so a significant portion of their livelihoods? \nThese issues – particularly that of compensation and the problems of poor reporting \n– have certainly been topics of hot debate among the veterinary and public health \ncommunity. Proper, effective and timely compensation is seen as a key factor in \n45 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.\n46 Interview, UK, 11 March 2008.\n1918\nthe response47 but in practice conditions on the ground are often unpredictable \n– and intertwined with more socio-cultural and political factors, such as historical \nrelationships between citizens and the state, perceptions of and trust in expertise, \nthe symbolic and cultural value of poultry, and the particular livelihood contexts of \noften very poor people. In the neat, technical narrative of the veterinary response, \nthese factors rarely get a look in; and if acknowledged at all are seen as part of the \nproblem: things to be got rid of in the strides towards a modern animal health system. \nSo what are these points of contention, where a more thorough-going and \nsearching, context-specific debate is required? Below, a few are listed which \nemerged repeatedly in our interviews:\nu What is to blame backyard birds or commercial flocks – or somewhere in between? \nu What are the implications for ‘restructuring’ and ‘biosecurity’? Can bans work? \nWho wins, who loses?\nu Wild birds, ducks or trade? Roles in spread and persistence in different agro-\necological and economic settings.\nu Disease dynamics – seasonality, cyclicity – and patterns of re-infection. Is \nelimination really feasible with large hot spots of ‘viral soup’ nearby?\nu Culling strategies: complete, ring, or not at all? What approaches to compensation? \nIs this a high cost but low return option in many places?\nu How effective is vaccination (and available vaccines)? Why is there cyclical re-\ninfection despite thorough campaigns? \nu Does the PVS system help design the ideal vet system - for what and for whom?\n47 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/HPAI_Compensation_Final.pdf\nSo, in the course of the past five or more years, a series of important uncertainties \nhave emerged, which add question marks, points of contention and awkward \nwrinkles to the neat and tidy veterinary outbreak (and stamp out) narrative. While \noften dismissed as marginal problems, we would argue that together these present \nsome more fundamental challenges. Within the policy community associated with \nthe veterinary response, these debates have started. We probed these and explored \nthe uncertainties with a range of different people. But, inevitably, a recasting of the \ncore framing presents difficult political, institutional and personal challenges for \nthose at the centre of the network. These debates are certainly about science, but \nmore importantly they are about power, money and position.\nWhat cuts across these debates is how complex, dynamic field experience in diverse \nsocio-cultural and political contexts matters, and so disturbs the neat formulae (and \nmanuals, protocols and pathways) offered from the international system. Also, and \nperhaps more challengingly, this experience suggests that in a number of (possibly \nincreasing) places there is a need to move from a framing based on an outbreak \nand eradication mode – the standard, professional entrenched framing of veterinary \nscience and practice – to a framing which acknowledges persistent, perhaps \npermanent, endemism – something that seems almost unthinkable for some. \nThese tensions point to some simmering conflicts between different people and \norganisations within this actor-network, suggesting that the network is not as solid \nand water-tight as it sometimes appears. Fracture lines exist between the OIE and \nFAO, and indeed within these organisations, based on understandings of mandates \nand normative positioning (regulating veterinary standards according to universal \nglobal rules versus agriculture for development, livelihoods and poverty reduction, \nfor example), and between head office and field vets and consultants, the latter \nexperienced in the complications of the front line. And at the technical level there are \ndisputes about some real uncertainties, about the structural and ecological drivers \nof the disease and its spread, and the efficacy and appropriateness of different \nintervention measures. These came to the surface, perhaps for the first time in \npublic, at the OIE-FAO-WHO June 2007 technical meeting held in Rome48. Here, \ndebates raged on the value of culling, particularly in increasingly endemic settings, \nwith some tense stand-offs emerging in different sessions by some accounts.\nMany – on both sides of these disputes – reflected on this meeting as one of the \nhigh points of the previous few years. At last some of the real issues were being \ndiscussed openly; the institutional grandstanding and the squabbling over resources \nwere put aside and the real issues were being debated (at least at the technical \nlevel – the lack of detailed socio-cultural and livelihood analysis remained starkly \nabsent). Confronting uncertainties and debating alternatives must be a good thing. \nBut in highly political and often tenuous policy processes it can be dangerous. Actor \nnetworks can fracture, tight narratives can unravel, and the political position and \nresource flows can be threatened. It was clear that this was in some people’s minds \nby mid 2007, as the 2006 pledged funds either were used up or failed to arrive. The \nmedia had lost interest, politicians were beginning to question whether this really \nwas ‘the big one’ that they had to be concerned with, and now the scientists and \ntechnicians were questioning things. Was this going to turn out to be a very, very \nshort window of opportunity for the veterinary profession to show its mettle, and get \nitself funded?  \nAs we discuss in more detail below, by the end of 2007 at the Delhi conference, the \nactor network had once more closed ranks and put on a public face of unity and \ncoherence. This for some seemed the last chance to rekindle support and interest. \nAnd there is nothing better than a new narrative to make this happen – for it was \n48 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007d) http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//232786/\nah671e.pdf \n2120\nat the Delhi conference that the One World, One Health slogan was launched. \nAnimal health was going to be on a par with the major players in the global scheme \nof things – human public health and ecosystem health (now often referred to in \nrelation to climate change).\n \n5. PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES\nThe potential major public health consequences of an influenza pandemic were of \ncourse the rallying cry that in the end grabbed attention and raised resources. In \nterms of positioning in the wider actor network, the WHO is very much in the centre. \nWhile recognising the importance of the veterinary dimensions, many in the public \nhealth community have little knowledge or interest in the animal origins of the \ndisease49. It is the public health consequences that are, for them, the major concern. \nThe Global Influenza Programme in the WHO, established in 1952 and linked \nto a network of national influenza centres, collaborating centres and reference \nlaboratories, has been central to this effort50. On-going influenza monitoring, virus \nsampling and regular flu shots have been part and parcel of the global public health \nprogramming for decades. The model is very much that of global public health \nsystem, linking national systems in a global network around public delivery for \nboth prevention and cure. This is the model on which the WHO was built – public \nfunds for public health: the classic global public goods model. As elsewhere in the \nmedical profession a technical, medical, technology driven approach (drugs and \nvaccines and hospitals) competes with a more prophylactic, preventative, primary \ncare approach, where non-pharmaceutical and community based interventions are \nseen to be the most effective. \nYet both strands exist within a framework of public support and state structures, \nvery much the post-war modernist vision of development.  While this vision has \nbeen disturbed and questioned of late, even with the new rhetoric of public private \npartnerships, of advance purchase agreements with pharma companies, of private \nmedical provision and so on, much of the old statist model still persists. A rapid \nreview of annual reports of the WHO over the years for example sees new languages \nand perspectives, but a remarkable persistence in vision and commitment to public \nprovision on a global scale.\n49 However, within WHO a Veterinary Public Health unit existed within the Communicable Disease \nDepartment from 1949. A much larger programme was established in the American Region and \nit still is in place. The Inter-American joint Health and Agriculture Meetings at Ministerial Level \n(RIMSA) bring together high-level decision-makers from both agriculture and health, and \nrecommendations are brought to the governing bodies of the Pan American Health Organization. \nSee http://www.panaftosa.org.br/ for more details on this cross-sectoral collaboration.\n50 http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/en/ See: Hampson (1997) and Lazzari, S. and K. Stöhr (2004). \nThus, for WHO, the overall narrative is firmly centred in the ‘outbreak’ mode. A \npotential major public health emergency is in the offing, it is argued. This could \nbe on a par with 1918, or potentially worse. This requires a global response, with \nWHO in the lead, and substantial investment in technology (drugs, vaccines) \nand health systems (delivery, infrastructure). Within this, there are perhaps three \noverlapping strands identifiable, each associated with different groups within and \noutside WHO.\nFirst is the technological response. This focuses on drugs and vaccines and their \ndelivery. As an informant from WHO noted, this is a standard response:\nDrugs, vaccines, it is inevitably the response. It is the way we operate in health \nsystems. They are more tangible than behavioural responses. It is easier for a system \nto respond. It is easier to have a stockpile than tell people to wash their hands51.\nYet the details have caused a massive debate which can only be touched on here. \nThere are multiple views on what is the best strategy, many of them very strongly \nheld. Medical opinion combines with logistical realism with commercial pressure, \nand it is difficult to pick apart the rationales and influences52. The WHO has stock-\npiled donated anti-viral drugs for rapid containment purposes, while the US has \nabout 70 million treatment courses of anti-virals in federal and state stockpiles53. \nElsewhere, no-one seems to know how far this policy has been implemented, as \nboth the costs of getting hold of anti-virals such as oseltamivir and the political \nchallenge of defining who is worth protecting have constraints. And then there are \nquestions of efficacy. Studies in Norway in early 2008 highlighted the possibility \nthat the stockpiled drugs would not work, as oseltamivir resistance to seasonal \ninfluenza (H1N1) was detected54. Many of the drugs stockpiled in the early period of \nthe crisis are now nearing the end of their shelf life, and big decisions are pending \nrelating to their replacement; a subject on which medical opinion is divided. \nVaccination policy has been especially controversial55. While regular, seasonal \ninfluenza vaccination has been recommended by the WHO, uptake even in \nthe west has been limited. The challenges of isolating seasonal influenza viral \nstrains, manufacturing the vaccine and making a profit from it have been well \ndocumented (Poland and Marcuse, 2004).  Around 16 manufacturers globally are \ncurrently in relatively advanced stages of producing H5N1 vaccines through a \nvariety of egg and cell based manufacturing techniques56. WHO has committed to \nstockpiling 50 million doses, and the European Commission has recently licensed \n51 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\n52 European Vaccine Manufacturers (2005).\n53 http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/biz-plan/news/apr2508iom.html\n54 Lackenby et al (2008) and see http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/oseltamivir_summary/en/index.\nhtml. See also Lipsitch et al (2007); de Jong et al (2005).\n55 See: Fedson (2003, 2005); Monto (2006); Subbarao and Joseph (2007); Flahault et al (2006).\n56 http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/WHO_HSE_EPR_GIP_2008_1/en/index.html\n2322\nGlaxoSmithKline’s vaccine Prepandrix57. Yet global estimates suggest that, given \ncurrent manufacturing capacity, only 500 million doses would be available 12 months \nafter a pandemic outbreak. There are hopes that the use of vaccine adjuvants to \nreduce the required dose will increase capacity (Yamada et al 2008). But would \nthis be sufficient in the timeframe and on the scale of a global pandemic? Who \nwould make a pandemic vaccine? Where? Who would have access and who would \nnot? What financing models would work? These are tough questions touching on \nintellectual property, business models and corporate profits, as well as medical \nethical and moral dilemmas. They are such sensitive discussions that they do not \noften occur in polite conversation. The current realities put into question all the \nworthy commitments to global health equity, as the reality is clear – only a few, \nrelatively rich people will have access to any vaccine, given the current global \ndistribution of manufacturing capacity, the costs of production and distribution and \nthe lack of cold chain and other facilities in many parts of the world. And even the \nrich, northern elite will be lucky to get anything if the pandemic spreads quickly with \ndramatic effects on economies, transport and mortality. In the end it may be only \npoliticians, the military and some health professionals who benefit. \nBut of course no one knows the details of the future prospects and consequences of \na human pandemic, and that’s the point. While the debate can often seem very dense \nand technical with long discussions of genomic sequencing, antibody responses, \nvaccine adjuvants and so on, most people we talked to, when pushed, said that \nthey had no idea what might work and what might happen. Of course this is not an \nargument for doing nothing, and indeed the substantial investments in research on \nvaccines of different sorts (both into types – RNA, killed, attenuated, subunit) and \nproduction methods (traditional egg cultures, cell based and so on) may well pay \noff, as well as the commitments to ensuring a more widely distributed manufacturing \ncapacity is in place. These programmes are absorbing substantial funds, with \nuncertain pay-offs. For example, the European Commission’s high profile research \nprogramme on influenza, costed at over EUR 65 million58, has most of these resources \ninvested in upstream vaccine research by partnerships of university departments \nand biotech and pharma companies across Europe59. Similarly, support to new \nmanufacturing capacity in the developing world, while backed by private finance, \nis being supported by public funds. To date, nearly 100 low and middle income \ncountries have told WHO that they want financial support for increasing access to a \npandemic vaccine, and in April 2007 WHO approved initial grants of $2.5m each to \nsix manufacturers from Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam60. \n57 The Lancet Infectious Diseases - Vol. 8, Issue 7, July 2008, Page 409. The WHO stock-pile \nrelates to rapid containment only, but has been a recommendation from the Strategic Advisory \nGroup of Experts on Immunization to stockpile 150 million doses for rapid containment and \nemergency personnel in low and middle income countries.\n58 European Commission, Influenza Research EU funded projects 2001-7, Luxembourg 2007 (EUR2282)\n59 http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/influenza/projects_en.html\n60 http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7600/925-a?ck=nck. See the WHO’s Global Pandemic \nInfluenza Action Plan to Increase Vaccine Supply (2006) at http://www.who.int/vaccines-\ndocuments/DocsPDF06/863.pdf.\nBut all of this is about the future, some of it potentially very long term. At the moment, \nwhat is the technological front-line? So-called H5 ‘pre-pandemic’ vaccines are \navailable, but while good as a sales pitch for certain big pharma companies, they \nonly provide some generic immunity to viruses resembling the one that may (or \nmay not) be a pandemic strain. ‘Pre-pandemic’, as some informants pointed out, \nis a misnomer – as until the pandemic happens, we don’t know what to immunise \nagainst, so this is a potentially expensive guessing game. Of course, the ‘holy grail’, \nas one scientist put it, is a universal vaccine which provides a combined response \nto a dozen or more influenza virus types, but this seems a long way off. As with \nother difficult-to-treat diseases, the influenza virus is incredibly variable, prone to \nrapid change in properties and difficult to pin down with a vaccination strategy \nwhich is not continuously adapting - seasonal virus vaccine strains must be re-\nassessed each year in each hemisphere. Indeed, many argue that the ‘silver bullet’ \nsolution is a false promise, providing funds for expensive labs but little else. Such \nsceptics argue that the only feasible vaccine solution would have to be based on a \nglobal commitment to an infrastructure for universal provision of season influenza \nvaccine, and undertaking that would cost substantial resources and would have \nto be backed by public money on a massive scale. As several people pointed out, \nthere are nowhere near six billion syringes and needles, let along vaccine vials, \nbeing produced or even stored right now, and no likelihood that this will happen \nany time in the near future.\nIn sum the technology fix narrative strand – addressing the outbreak through \nsolely technological means – looks shaky when probed. Yet this contrasts with \nthe up-beat assessments by commercial outfits with pipeline research and \ndevelopment investments and public-philanthropic funding commitments of the \nGates Foundation, Wellcome Trust and others. Most technicians and researchers \nadmit the challenges freely, but those in the core policy and business circuits are \nmore reluctant, given the investments and commitments being made. The focus \non technology-as-solution is thus backed by big players in a strong, mutually \nreinforcing network. Cynics point to the ‘revolving door’ between public agencies \nsuch as the WHO, philanthropic organisations and big pharma, and how a particular \nversion of the outbreak narrative feeds into support for commercial interests and \nparticular research efforts61. But such arguments are countered strongly by pointing \nout that synergies between public, private and philanthropic efforts are essential \ngiven the scale of the challenge, and that the efforts in technology development are \nfor the long-term – and in the scale of things where public money is spent (the most \nfrequently mentioned of course were defence commitments in Iraq or Afghanistan), \nthis is small fry62.\n61 There was comment for example when Klaus Stöhr, formerly head of the Global Influenza \nProgramme and a staunch supporter of global vaccine programmes left for Novartis to head up \ntheir vaccine R and D (see WHO flu chief leaves for Novartis, http://www.the-scientist.com/news/\ndisplay/43504/). \n62 The war in Iraq is calculated to cost $341 million per day; the UK’s NHS budget was £90 billion \nin 2007; in 2008 the UK’s MoD announced a contract price of £3.2 billion for two new aircraft carriers.\n2524\nA second public health narrative focuses on non-pharma options. This emphasises \npublic education and communication, as well as measures such as ‘social distancing’ \nin the face of an outbreak to reduce infection and mortality. The assumption is that \nthe technological fixes will not be available or sufficient, so the most efficacious \nresponse may be through changing behaviour. A variety of ‘knowledge, attitude and \npractice’ surveys were done63, in the standard vein of public health research, and \nwith all the problems associated with them. In addition, a variety of communication \nmessages for public education were developed in different parts of the world64. \nWith funds from the Japanese government, UNICEF had led these efforts, with \nWHO and a number of NGOs involved. \nUNICEF’s main concern, starting in early 2006, has been changing human behaviour \nto prevent animal-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus. These programmes \nare in a familiar mode for UNICEF and other learning and social change health \nprogramming, focusing on a few standard health messages (wash hands, cook \nmeat properly, don’t let kids work or play with chickens and so on). An informant \nfrom UNICEF explained the history:\nFollowing Beijing, it was identified that communications were going to be key for \nboth prevention and control, and an inter-agency meeting was organised in Geneva \nwith WHO, FAO, UNICEF, and others from the regional offices…The result was \ndistilled into the four main points - reporting, cooking, separating, hand-washing. \nSo the messages were identified after consultation with the technical agencies as \nreasonably simple, attainable and effective and feasible actions very much with the \nbackyard farmers in mind65.\nOnly now is UNICEF moving towards pandemic mitigation, which involves \nprescriptions and routines for health etiquettes, quarantine, social distancing and \nso on. In the developed world at least, this approach received a boost in February \n2007 when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with the \nDepartments of Commerce, Transport, and Health and Human Services, published \n‘Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic \nInfluenza Mitigation in the United States – Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Non-\npharmaceutical Interventions’66. This involved plans for closing schools, cancelling \npublic gatherings, organising work leave, tele-working strategies and so on. At \nthe time, it was seen as an acceptance of the limitations of the pharmaceutical \nresponse, a realisation that the pandemic would hit months before any vaccine was \navailable, and that the only other prophylaxes – antivirals – were in limited supply, \nof unproven efficacy, and essentially untested in a pandemic scenario. \nHot on the heels of this move came two historical studies funded by the US National \nInstitutes of Health. One found that in the 1918 pandemic, rapid social containment \nmeasures had cut peak weekly death rates in some US cities by up to half. In the \nmost extreme case, the peak mortality rate in Philadelphia was eight times that of St. \nLouis, which had been quicker to implement social control measures (Hatchett et al \n2007). The other study (Bootsma and Ferguson 2007) used mathematical models to \nreproduce the pattern of the 1918 pandemic and found that cities that had relaxed their \nrestrictions after the peak of the pandemic often saw the re-emergence of infection.\nNow – in the US at least – the ramifications of twenty-first century style social \ndistancing are beginning to be better understood. There are optimistic aspirations \ntowards communities developing their ‘social capital’, and of all households being \nrich and organised enough to hold six weeks food in reserve. But what happens if \nthere is mass panic? The social, political and security consequences remain largely \nunaddressed. In other parts of the world, such ‘social distancing’ approaches \nmay not work. As one informant put it “It’s all very well having this simple idea of \neverybody staying at home, but if it’s ten in a room, in a home that is no distance \nfrom the next, it doesn’t really make any sense. We need ideas that are going to \nwork”67. Another observed: \nIt is accepted…that containment will not work. In all countries with humanitarian crises, \ngovernance tends to be weak. How can such strategies be implemented? Even in \nEurope. We are already moving to the next step – response. But what realistically can \nbe done? Some basic capacity issues, yes. Keep the electricity functioning, ensure \nsome basis services. This is important. But vaccines and so on? No. Basically you \nare on your own. Sit indoors and hope for the best!68\nBut in the professional worlds of vets, medics and agronomists, the advertising \nbuyers, copywriters and vague creative types that make up the communications \ndepartment don’t get much space at the table. One informant commented “UNICEF \nis not an equal in the interagency debate”69. Another observed:\nWe see it at the international meetings. The whole day can be very animal focused - \nvaccination, culling and so on - with just an hour maybe at the end to talk about the social \naspects - things like closing schools, transport issues. The vets are not keen to accept that \nthe threat of a human pandemic has driven much of the momentum, action and funding. \nIf it was just an animal threat, we would not have seen anything like this response70.\n63 For example in Egypt (http://www.comminit.com/en/node/223876) and Cambodia (http://www.\nfoodsecurity.gov.kh/docs/ENG/KAP-Surway-Evaluation-Poultry.pdf).\n64 http://www.unicef.org/influenzaresources/\n65 Interview, New York, 19 June 2008.\n66 USA Department Of Health And Human Services (2007).\n67 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.\n68 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\n69 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.\n70 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.\nIt is also the case that the nature of UNICEF’s avian influenza funding created its \nown dynamics. First, it was specifically targeted at East Asia. Second, the distinct \nand separate nature of UNICEF’s initial funding stream (from the government \n2726\nof Japan) meant that UNICEF was to some (albeit small) degree made remote \nfrom the other agencies. Third, when the Japanese money ran out there was, as \nsomeone put it, “a huge sucking sound”71, and there are now worries all round \nthat a large expectation has been generated that will not be fulfilled, and that the \ncommunications component of the response has not been regularised and bedded-in.\nNevertheless, avian influenza communications programmes have raised awareness \nlevels significantly in many places that there is a new deadly chicken disease that \ncan affect humans. Specific, most often domestic behaviours, such as cooking \nprocedures and hand washing, have proved relatively easy to influence, but more \ndetailed knowledge and behaviours about what should be done in the case of more \nanimal-focused activities such as reporting and separation have proved more difficult. \nAnd only now, in 2008, are the most obvious social and behavioural aspects of \ninfection and disease spread, such as gender, being investigated (Velasco et al 2008).\nNo systematic studies, to our knowledge, have really delved into the understandings \nof people’s risk perceptions and how cultural practices might affect their responses. \nThe practice of drinking duck’s blood, common in parts of Asia, was looked upon by \nsome with revulsion and horror, rather than as something that had to be understood \nin embedded cultural terms. Similarly, the social, economic and prestige associated \nwith birds in places like Thailand, where prize fighting cocks are very much valued, \nwas not seen as central. Indeed, when people rejected the health messages of \ndifferent programmes in Sumatra, one informant – a communications professional \n– talked of the ‘hocus pocus’ witchcraft involved72. The people were seen as \nbackward and in need of modernisation, and their fatalism about death and disease \nsomething that could be overcome through education and propaganda. That it \nfailed seemed to be a surprise, only acting to reinforce cultural prejudices. \nThus the non-pharma interventions have been, with a few notable exceptions73, \nlargely constructed around a fairly top-down, instrumentalist version of behaviour \nchange, which in the context of a pandemic setting would have to be enforced. \nUnderstanding alternative narratives of the disease and its impact have, as in other \napproaches already discussed, not been a priority.\nA third important public health narrative emphasises less the measures to be taken \nbut more the system within which the measures are supposed to be delivered. This is \nthe classic ‘health systems’ approach: it is argued that with a well-functioning system, \nresponsive to local needs and supplying high quality care, and with appropriate \ntechnological back-up, any outbreak, whether pandemic influenza or something \nelse, can be dealt with. This is similar to the stance taken by the veterinarians, \nas we have seen. With decades of underfunding and with many national health \nsystems in a flux of quasi-privatisation, pandemic influenza resources could, it is \n71 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.\n72 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\n73 See http://www.comminit.com/en/avianinfluenza.html\nargued, help rebuild some of these systems which are currently in deep disrepair. \nThis is a classic global public goods response, contributing to proofing the world \nagainst a future pandemic (cf. Smith and MacKellar 2007).\nAnd, like the vets, the medical professionals in WHO and beyond know what a \ngood health system should look like: structured, ordered, well resourced, state \nfunded, and run by doctors (something similar to Germany, France, the UK, or \nSweden). Information, prediction and early warning is key for this to work well. And \na responsive system which allows the right response to happen at the right time, in \nthe right place. For this reason, and as discussed further in section 5, substantial \ninvestment in information systems and surveillance is seen as critical. \nOf course most of the world is not like western Europe and the ideal health system \nprobably doesn’t exist anywhere. Whether it is a desirable or achievable goal is also \nwidely questioned, given the realities on the ground, where hybrid public-private-\ntraditional systems exist in highly unregulated and poorly resourced settings, and \nwhere, increasingly, services can be purchased in pharmacists and on the Internet \n(Bloom et al 2007). \nAgain, as with the veterinary response, when probed, no-one quite knows what \nwill work where and when – and for whom. The basic models are based on North \nAmerican or European responses, with different emphases on technological, non-\npharma and health system responses, yet reality often acts to undermine and \nchallenge these idealised narratives in practice. There are some big interests at \nplay here – and it is not surprising that large pharmaceutical and biotechnology \ncompanies are pushing technological solutions, hoping for public funding to offset \ntheir commercial risks. \nFor the WHO, and others making the case for global public health, the avian \ninfluenza crisis came at a good time. The wider public health narrative served \ninstitutional purposes well. As a UN agency whose core resources had declined \nover time, and whose primacy of position had been overtaken by other initiatives \nsuch as the Global Fund or UNAIDS, building on the long-term influenza programme \nand undoubted experience and expertise offered an opportunity to present WHO \nas the core organisation able to respond to the potential crisis. The then Director \nGeneral, Lee Jong-Wook, made the case and galvanised early support from the \nUN system, and from the Secretary General in particular. The International Health \nRegulations, seen as a revalorisation of the WHO with new powers to operate at \na global level, were approved with the avian flu crisis providing an important spur \nto action. Funds to the WHO started to flow and information and virus tracking \nsystems, as well as laboratory and vaccine facilities, were planned and built. Lee \nhowever died suddenly in May 2006, and a successor had to be found. Margaret \nChan was appointed, whose experience of successfully dealing with the SARS \noutbreak in Hong Kong was seen as a key factor in her appointment. She quickly \nsaw the importance of the avian influenza issue, and, drawing on her experience, \nbacked the WHO avian influenza initiatives.  \n2928\nHowever, as discussed at greater length in section 8, the international coordination \nof the avian flu response changed over time, particularly within the UN system. \nWhen David Nabarro – a British medical doctor who had previously worked at WHO, \nand before that at DFID – was appointed by the Secretary General to head UNSIC, \nthe centre of gravity shifted from Geneva to New York. There was also pressure to \nmake the response more coordinated and coherent, with technical agencies across \nthe UN (notably WHO, FAO, UNICEF, but also WFP, UNOCHA and others) and \noutside (notably OIE and the World Bank, but also others) speaking off one sheet. \nAs discussed in section 8, this was no easy task. And to this day, there are those \nin WHO who resent this move towards cross-agency coordination. This surely was \na WHO mandate, they argue, and why was the Secretary General and UNDG, and \nincreasingly the World Bank, none of them health specialists, meddling in this when \nthe obvious technical capacity sits within the mandated UN agency? \nThis resentment has persisted and coloured some initiatives and efforts. The DG, \nMargaret Chan, however has regularly risen above these usually local wrangles \nof territory and resources, and committed the WHO publicly to the more joined up \ncause, often emphasising the non-health aspects of avian influenza in speeches, not \nalways to the delight of her colleagues. This changing and sometimes ambivalent \npositioning of the WHO in the policy process is central to understanding both the \nprocess and its outcomes. \nThe vision of the WHO, with new International Health Regulations under its belt, as \nthe guarantor of global health security is a strong one, articulated forcefully in both \nnumerous publications and many of the interviews we conducted. The security \ndiscourse is important, as discussed in section 9. The language is often telling. \nThis highlights the role of cross-border intervention, with medics being the army \nfighting the war against the disease with the weapons of vaccines and drugs. But \noften this is wrapped up in a higher, more worthy, moral language of ‘responsibility’ \nand ‘rights’, equally important dimensions of the WHO vision. Unlike perhaps the \nveterinary world, where issues of capability, rights and access don’t get a look in, \nthese are very much part of the discourse in the public health world. Yet in both \nthe military and the access/rights-focused metaphors and linguistic turns, a rather \nbenevolent, top-down, we-know-best version comes across. As several informants \nput it “you have to remember this place (referring to the WHO) is full of doctors”. \nBut there is also humility amongst the bravado. In particular, a number of more \nsenior figures commented on the failures of the public health community globally \nto respond to the HIV/AIDS pandemic effectively. This is a scar on the conscience \nof some, and something that, as committed professionals, they do not want to \nrepeat. Yet, at the same time, a familiar refrain is that they do not want to repeat the \nUNAIDS solution. The UNAIDS building, with its fine public sculptures and modern \narchitecture sits opposite the WHO building. It is regarded by those in the WHO with \na mixture of disdain and envy. Envy for the profile and resources, but disdain for the \nwaste, lack of technical skills and, in some people’s assessment, a poor record of \nachievement. Those involved in the avian influenza response are proud that they \nhave developed a leaner, more efficient and technically informed response, which \ndoes not need a fancy new building, but can build on the in-house capacities and \nexperiences of the WHO in particular. \nHowever, there is concern evident in the corridors of the WHO and other agencies \nworking on the public health side. The longer the pandemic doesn’t happen, the \nmore questions are raised about avian influenza as a human, public health priority. \nSurely there are other more pressing problems – what about the big killers like \nmalaria or diarrhoeal diseases? Is this the best way to spend money, some ask? \nThis is a real dilemma, and one that again raises the spectre of shameful negligence \non the scale of HIV/AIDS which no-one wants to repeat. \nAs things stand, a wide range of uncertainties persist – from the big unknown (will a \npandemic happen at all, and if so when?) to the specific unknowns (about vaccination \nand drug efficacy, about behaviour change in situations of crisis and so on). Again, \nrather echoing the on-going debates about other responses to epidemics such as \nHIV/AIDS, debates rage on whether a treatment focused approach (drugs/vaccines) \nmakes sense, or whether preventative approaches (behaviour change) have the \nbest results, or whether both have a role. Should the response be led by the state, \nor can private providers and community action offer better and cheaper solutions? \nOr can some form of partnership be developed that transcends these boundaries? \nAs we have seen, different narratives about cause and effect, problem and \nsolution compete in the public health field, but all respond to a characteristic \n‘outbreak narrative’ and are confined to a fairly technical, formulaic response, with \nuncertainties of all sorts pervading. But the big question remains: is this enough? \nAre the combined measures of vaccine and drug development and stockpiling, \nbehaviour change and public education and health system improvement really \nincreasing the world’s resilience to uncertain future zoonotic threats? Who is \nleft out – and where? What alternative narratives are obscured by the dominant \nframing, and what structural inequalities are sustained or provoked by the political \ninterests that prevail? These are questions that are picked up in section 10. First, \nhowever, we take a look at a third major narrative surrounding avian flu: pandemic \npreparedness and emergency response.\n3130\n6. PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS\nAnother strand of activity, again firmly centred on an ‘outbreak narrative’, focuses on \npandemic preparedness. This is much larger than the public health response, and \nlinks to wider issues of economic risk management, business continuity planning, \ncivil contingency and emergency response. In this narrative, the worst needs to \nbe prepared for…and it could be very bad. With food supplies restricted, energy \nsystems disrupted and the Internet down, widespread panic and fear could grip any \npopulation faced with overloaded hospitals, sick or absent medical staff, numerous \ncorpses, and military-style containment measures. Of course no-one knows the \nlikelihood of any of this happening, and many regard it as highly unlikely given \nthe way the H5N1 strain has been evolving74. Nevertheless pandemic influenza \nis high on the risk registers of national security agencies, and prime ministers and \npresidents don’t want to mess up. As one informant described:\nThis global pandemic response element is being driven by the US, Japan, Europe, \nAustralia of course, but it is a genuine developmental problem – it will be the \ndeveloping world that will be most hit. We all have to have pandemic preparedness... \nthe first line of defence is seen to be the developing world75.\nThe US in particular has taken this side of things very seriously. To date it has \nbeen untouched by the avian disease, and SARS only got as far as Canada. Yet \npreparing for a pandemic has been highlighted as a major priority by the Bush \nadministration over the last few years, and substantial resources have been spent \nacross government and business. Local government and city authorities, Wall Street \nand the corporate world, and the military, have all undertaken big simulations, and \nmade significant investments. Significant too is a different culture of threat, fear and \nanxiety in the US, where safety and security are seen as a paramount, especially \nsince the attack on the twin towers in September 2001. As one informant explained:\nWhat drove it from the White House was the national strategy. That document is \nour best shot at identifying the totality of what a pandemic would bring. By having \nour Department of Homeland Security focussed on the critical issues – by getting \nthe department of aviation to work with the airline industry for example – it really \nis looking at the totality of it, going far beyond the human outbreak, far beyond the \nanimal outbreak, but at the same time we have to realise its limitations76.\n74 Horimoto et al (2004).\n75 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.\n76 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\nThe UN system has taken the pandemic threat seriously too. In 2005, the Secretary \nGeneral, then Kofi Annan, called a high level meeting and urged a cross agency \nresponse, with a central coordinating unit based in the UN Development Group at \nUNDP. The first concern was internal: how was the UN going to respond? What \nwas going to be required of the UN system in the event of a major outbreak? How \nwas the UN going to ‘survive to serve’ – to keep its own people alive and healthy in \norder to help others around the world? This was, for some, thinking the unthinkable. \nMany in the agencies dismissed this as alarmism: they were busy people, they had \ntheir own projects to get on with. But others in senior administrative positions have \nincreasingly taken the pandemic preparedness agenda on board. \nConsequently agencies across the UN have prepared plans, and a subset has \nundertaken simulation exercises to test these plans. A number of cross-UN \nexercises have been undertaken to test out what might happen under different \ncircumstances. UNOCHA, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs, and its specialised Pandemic Influenza Contingency (PIC) team, has taken \nthe lead within the UN system, supported by the World Food Programme and others. \nThey have developed a number of training modules and have worked intensively \nwith UN country teams across the world77. They have a ‘UN system pandemic \npreparedness map’ and indicators to show the level of preparedness around the \nworld, showing the vast majority of the world to be ‘less or medium prepared’78.\nMany involved in this effort are brutally honest about the level of preparedness. \nThe world is definitely not, they say. It might be more so now than before, but if a \npandemic emerges quickly, is identified late and spreads fast with characteristics \nthat result in high mortalities, the plans and preparations may not be worth much: \nOur assumption is that systems will fail. No early warning, or a cull of chickens… We \nsimulate two weeks of confusion. We try to be realistic. Total a six week period. At the \nend of the first week – identification of a novel virus. Containment is on-going. Week \ntwo - containment fails. Week three - three countries are swamped. Week four – it’s \na global pandemic.79  \n77 http://ocha.unog.ch/drptoolkit/PSimulations.html\n78 http://www.un-pic.org/pic/web/index.aspx\n79 Interview, Geneva, 6 March 2008.\n80  Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\nAnother informant commented:\nGiven the complexities of the pandemic, given the resources that would be required \nto deal with the severe one, we will never prepare.80\nYet everyone also stresses forcefully, this should not mean we just adopt a fatalistic \ncomplacency and do nothing. For this reason, they argue, investing in pandemic \npreparedness planning and developing contingency arrangements and emergency \nsystems are essential. These are useful anyway, as they could be used for other \ndisaster situations, whether an earthquake, flood or terror attack. Certain principles \n3332\napply: clear information systems, short chains of command, centralised decision \nmaking, clear areas of responsibility, stockpiled resources which can be mobilised \nat speed and a rehearsed pattern of action which can be unrolled quickly. \nIn practice, of course, the experience has been mixed81. According to the UNSIC/\nWorld Bank Progress Report (2007), 120 pandemic preparedness plans have been \ndeveloped around the world. Most of these have been drafted by cross-ministry \ngroups, often under a senior official with political clout – if not the president or \nprime minister at least their deputies. This is seen as an important success: there \nis political buy-in, cross-government coordination and an agreed plan. But a little \nprobing suggests that this may be more form than substance. Most plans are long, \nturgid documents, developed from templates elsewhere. ‘Useless’, ‘not worth \nthe paper they are written on’, ‘creating a false sense of security’ were some of \nthe comments we heard – including from those who helped prepare them. And, \nalthough they may exist on paper, most have not been tested at all. Thus all sorts of \ngrand plans exist, but there is a certainty that they won’t happen in practice. “How \ncan you expect hundreds of trucks to be mobilised to transport food to containment \nareas when there are no stockpiles of either food or fuel?” someone asked82. A \nfew countries have carried out detailed simulations of their plans under a range of \ncircumstances, including the UK83, but even in these contexts (rich, well resourced), \nthere is some doubt about the plans’ likely effectiveness. Getting engagement with \nplanning for the unknown is difficult, even within the UN system. As one informant \nput it “it’s so hard to get people to focus on an emerging pandemic. They say ‘Leave \nme alone...I have a programme to run’”84.\nSo, despite the doubts and concerns, the pandemic preparedness narrative \ncontinues to take up a lot time and effort - and a large chunk of the global resources. \nWith avian influenza framed as a ‘crisis’ or an ‘emergency’, far more resources were \nmobilised than if it was cast as a development problem of poor people’s poultry. The \ncrisis and emergency framing has its advantages – there is urgency, money flows \nand political commitment at the highest level is there. But it has its downsides: the \nmoney is fickle, short-term and tied to rapid response and timeframes; it can create \ndistorting incentives and lack of strategic thinking; people are employed on short-\nterm contracts with short-term money; and, because it is under the detailed scrutiny \nof the political masters, it can be used in ways that technically may not make sense \nto meet short-term political objectives.\nThe world of crises and emergencies is thus very different to the highly technical, \noften quite academic, cultures of the veterinary and public health responses \ndiscussed above. Across the avian influenza response the mix and interactions \nhave not always been easy, resulting in frustration, competition and confusion at \ntimes. Within the UN, for example, the humanitarian and emergency arm think \nin very different ways. They draw from military planning, logistics management \nand operations thinking, not technical understandings of epidemiology, ecology \nor economics. They focus on action and results, quickly and efficiently, rather \nthan long-term solutions to complex development challenges. The language is of \n‘emergency campaigns’ and ‘surge responses’. It has quite a gung-ho, muscular \nfeel to it, which sometimes does not go down well in other settings. A number of \nfairly standard disaster and emergency systems have been adopted and adapted \nfor the avian influenza response. From the US forest service, the ‘all-hazards \napproach’ has been pushed by USDA and USAID in their programming around \nthe world85. The investment in surveillance, information and emergency response \nsystems has been substantial, with emergency operations rooms installed in both \nFAO and WHO to help coordinate response to outbreaks. \nIn the WHO a former underground cinema room has been converted into a state-of-\nthe-art emergency room86 – the SHOC room . Around a large table a set of screens \nprovide up to the minute information on the unfolding of different outbreaks and \nthe responses being made. Banks of computers sit behind the room, with intercom \nand video link systems allowing connections with key experts in different parts of \nthe globe. On the day we visited avian influenza outbreaks featured prominently, \nalongside cholera, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever. It is an impressive set-up. At \nthe FAO another room, the Crisis Management Centre (CMC)87, furnished in bright \norange and known informally as the Guantanamo room, offers the same service \nand links to the WHO centre through daily tele/video conferences.  \nBut how effective will this impressive infrastructure be if a pandemic really occurs? \nIt is clear that the neat Phase 1 to 6 pattern of a slow and paced evolution of \na pandemic may not occur as the manuals suggest88.

Lee Strategic Health Operations Centre, http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/84/10/06-\n011006/en/\n87 http://www.fao.org/askfao/viewquestiondetails.do?questionId=51613\n88 See: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/pandemic/en/. The six phases identified by WHO \nmove from an inter-pandemic period (Phase 1: No new influenza virus subtypes have been \ndetected in humans. An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present \nin animals. If present in animals, the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low; \nPhase 2: No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a circulating \nanimal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease) to a pandemic alert \nperiod (Phase 3: Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at \nmost rare instances of spread to a close contact (“person-to-person”). Phase 4: Small cluster(s) \nwith limited human-to-human transmission but spread is highly localized, suggesting that the \nvirus is not well adapted to humans. Phase 5: Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread \nstill localized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to humans, but \nmay not yet be fully transmissible (substantial pandemic risk)) to a pandemic period (Phase \n6: Pandemic: increased and sustained transmission in general population).(see http://www.\nwho.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/GIP_2005_5Eweb.pdf for the Global Pandemic \nPreparedness Plan, WHO, 2005).\n3534\npreparedness documents show how early detection results in rapid containment \nand a slowing of the pandemic in Phases 3 and 4, allowing time to get ready \nfor the major consequences of the outbreak in the full global pandemic phase. \nThese carefully produced booklets and presentations are, however, open to some \nquestioning – and not a little derision. As many point out, we may not see a Phase \n3 or 4 at all, as a real pandemic strain will spread in days to every major city in the \nworld. And by Phase 5 or 6, countries will “be on their own”. Ideas of containment \nare accepted as wishful thinking by many, with some finding echoes of Cold \nWar thinking. Without extreme and highly disciplined military force, restricting a \npopulation to a small area would be impossible. Few governments would be able \nto enforce such a strategy, even if it made sense from the epidemiological point of \nview. When asked what he would do if a pandemic occurred, a senior official at the \nWHO answered succinctly: “head for the hills”. It was not a joke. \nSo, deep uncertainties remain – about information accuracy, prediction possibilities \nand response strategies – and no-one know quite what will happen when. Will we \nbe faced with a damp squib ‘slow-burn’ epidemic, or a global catastrophe? Or will \nnothing happen in our lifetimes?\nAn important question we return to below is whether this collective global response \nhas resulted in a safer world, more resilient to future disease episodes – either in \npandemic outbreak mode or not. We asked this question to a number of people \ninvolved in the international response to avian influenza and there were two views – \nyes…and no. These reflect institutional positions, technical knowledge and personal \noutlooks, but, more fundamentally, we suggest they reflect an important contrast \nin perspective between those who see a risk management approach as increasing \nsafety and resilience, and those who argue that recognising uncertainty and \nignorance as central requires a different approach – and indeed that conventional \napproaches to risk management may even make things riskier. \nWe will return to this debate in section 10. In the meantime, we want to turn to \nsome alternative narratives that have been obscured by the dominant outbreak \nnarratives discussed in the previous sections. For it is these – often discussed on \nthe margins by those outside the main circuits of power and influence – that may \noffer insights into what has been missed in the mainstream response, and pose \nchallenges to the way things have been done to date.\n7. MISSING DEBATES, ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVES\nLooking across the three main outbreak narratives discussed so far, we have to ask \nwhat is missing, obscured, hidden or blocked? Is there a set of alternative narrative \nframings that emerge from the margins as critiques of the mainstream? Rosenberg \n(1992) has argued that epidemics can be explained in at least three radically \ndifferent ways – contamination (focused on disease transmission), configuration \n(focused on disease context) and disposition (related to the individual carrier of \nthe disease). Each is important, and each has had different influences on our \nunderstandings of, and responses to, public health over time, he argues. Yet, the \ncontamination strand, and its emphasis on disease outbreaks, laboratory diagnosis \nand a treatment response has dominated at least since the mid-twentieth century. \nAs we have seen, this has certainly been true in the case of the avian influenza \nexample, but what about other explanations of epidemics? Arguments centred on \ndisposition have been important – the ‘super-spreaders’ of recent epidemiological \nmodels have often focused on particular individuals. Outbreak narratives often \ninvolve an important individual – from Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary) in 1907 in the \nUSA to the doctor who carried SARS to Hong Kong’s Metropole Hotel in 2003 \n– and, although no single individual or group has been identified as a ‘super-\nspreader’ in the epidemiological sense in the unfolding drama of avian influenza, \ncertain groups have been pinpointed as being more significant in the spread – and \nblamed for it. Thus, backyard chicken farmers and wet market traders in Asia – and \nthe Chinese perhaps in particular – have been fingered. The focus on ‘risk groups’ \nand particular agents of spread may remove emphasis from the wider context, the \nepidemic’s ‘configuration’ in Rosenberg’s terms. \nIn the welter of activity, funds, people and acronyms that the mainstream ‘outbreak’ \nand ‘contamination’ approaches have generated, it is easy to ignore alternative \nframings. Some of these are presented, not as alternatives or challenges to the \nmainstream views, but as complements, additions and nuances. Often they are \narticulated together with the mainstream narratives, but more as a polite add-\non, a superficial dressing, or an acknowledgement of alternative views, before \nproceeding with the main argument. These different framings are not always \npresented by radical opponents of the mainstream. Many of the most articulate \nadvocates of these views work within or for the core organisations at the centre of \nthe actor-network. Thus the relationship between these narratives and what has \nbeen discussed before is complex. \nWe suggest, however, that they each, in different ways, offer insights that are not \nfully dealt with in the mainstream outbreak narratives, and present interesting \nchallenges to the way an international response to avian influenza – or indeed \nother zoonotic diseases under the ‘One World, One Health’ banner – needs to be \nthought about. This section, therefore, addresses three alternative narratives. The \nfirst focuses on the causes of the disease and its dynamics; the second focuses on \n3736\nthe way normative concerns about poverty, livelihoods and equity are treated; and \nthe third focuses on questions of access and global governance. In different ways, \neach suggests challenges for the One World, One Health agenda which are not \nimmediately obvious in the mainstream approaches discussed so far.\nDYNAMIC DRIVERS AND UNDERLYING CAUSES OF NEW DISEASES\nThe outbreak narrative and associated emergency/crisis response tend to focus \non the outbreak event, not the underlying causes. Information systems are based \non reporting outbreaks, not changing epidemiological dynamics, for instance. And \nresponses tend to hone in on the diseased organism with treatment measures, or \nthe diseased area with disease control/eradication measures. This applies to both \nthe human and veterinary response framings. This is replicated in the emergency \nresponse which focuses on mitigating the worst impacts of an outbreak, both ‘at \nsource’ and after it has spread. \nAt least in the way that the narratives are framed, these are fairly standardised, \nuniversal responses which are ‘rolled out’ across the world according to plans, \nprogrammes, strategies backed up by protocols, manuals and regulations, and \noverseen by a technically-equipped and well resourced, benevolent ‘international \nsystem’. This universal, global vision is very much part of the contemporary rhetoric \n– and indeed frames the One World, One Health slogan. We are all in it together; \nwe know how to deal with; it requires coordination and coherence.\nScientific interventions – and models of different sorts in particular – act to reinforce \nthis framing. So computer models of disease spread for example show clearly how \nlocalised, at source eradication or containment efforts are critical in preventing \na global pandemic. This justifies cross-border intervention, under the concept of \n‘responsibility to protect’ to use the current jargon89. But of course models are just \nmodels and dependent on often quite heroic assumptions – like diseases spreading \nin concentric circles, that borders of countries and districts don’t matter, that people \nare prevented from moving and so on. Surreptitiously and insidiously these ideas \nhave an impact on policy framing, such is the power (and simplicity) of modelling. \nThe 2005 models published simultaneously in Nature and Science (Ferguson et al \n2005; Longini et al 2005) probably had such influence. While all well qualified and \nperfectly rigorous in their own right, somehow their implications were extrapolated, \nframing policy in a particular way. Here was the outbreak narrative in its purest \nform, with an outbreak response lined up, all justified by science90.\nAs an epidemiologist, I keep looking for that pump handle solution. You know, what \nis that thing which is causing, mostly women, who are mostly the ones who raise \nchickens, to become infected, and then go on to negative outcomes, to die? What \nabout the slaughter process?  What about the habit of picking the sickest bird in the \ngroup for the pot? And not being able to seek medical advice. The control might not \nactually be with birds, but at the human-animal interface that says how can I safely \nhandle an infected bird? That may be an area that has gone under-investigated. \nMaybe we need to hit exactly where the ministries of health and agriculture meet91.\nIf the real risks exist “exactly where ministries of health and agriculture meet”, \nit may be that the response, focused as it is on separate narratives of human \nand animal health may miss the “pump handle”. And, surely, understanding the \nunderlying drivers of disease change – and the socio-ecological dynamics of \nemergence – must be part of any international response. We assume that zoonotic \ndisease ‘hot spots’ exist where natural reservoirs of disease from wild fauna are \nfound close to usually rapidly growing urban conditions with intensive human-\nanimal contact, usually in settings where regulation and human health/veterinary \nservices are weak or non-existent. Southern China is an example – as is Indonesia, \nVietnam and much of south and south-east Asia, as well as urbanising Africa. The \nrisks may be further enhanced with certain practices – consuming bush meat, \nliving with livestock, shopping in wet markets and so on – and certain conditions 89 See http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/\n90 The influence of models with some heroic assumptions embedded in them on disease policy \ndebates is of course not new; see, for example, the UK foot-and-mouth policy debate in 2001 \n(Campbell and Lee 2003; Kitching 2004).\nBut – and no-one denies this – it is not so simple. Complex disease dynamics mean \nthat we don’t know what is going to happen when, and when outbreaks do occur, \ntheir pattern and impact is highly context specific. Such complexity is not amenable \nto simple outbreak models, and requires a deeper understanding of changing \necologies, demographies and socio-economic contexts – and, in particular, their \ninteractions and dynamics in particular places. This field level understanding of \ndynamic contexts is startlingly absent in much of the work on avian influenza. Yet \nquite a lot seems to be known, even if it appears rather anecdotally in research \npapers and conversations. The vivid descriptions of the ‘viral soup’ in Qinghai \nLake in western China, the migratory birds that carry the virus, and the increase \nin human-livestock interactions in rapidly growing urban centres, are startling. As \none ecologist put it: “There is a whirlpool of genes re-assorting…It’s a dream for \nreshuffling of viruses. The lake is a soup of viruses”. But beyond some surveys, \nreproduced as multi-coloured GIS maps (a favourite form of presentation in this \nfield – with red always being danger) (Pfeiffer et al 2007a, b; Jones et al 2008), \nand some recent work on duck-rice systems (Gilbert et al 2008), there has been \nremarkably little detailed socio-ecological investigation of the dynamics of change.\nGiven the potential threat and the resources being invested elsewhere in other \nactivities, this seems remarkable. It of course relates to the politics of the policy \nprocess, and the individuals, organisations and professional interests that have \ncaptured the agenda. One informant commented: \n91 Interview, Washington DC, 13 June 2008.\n3938\nAn outbreak narrative is an appropriate framing for those who do not live in these \nplaces and who want, for perfectly legitimate reasons, to protect themselves from \nany disease. But it is perhaps less so when seen from another perspective. In \nmany settings in the developing world, people are used to living with infectious \ndisease. They have deeply embedded ‘cultural logics’ (cf. Hewlett and Hewlett \n2007) that influence the way they understand and respond to diseases – of both \nanimals and humans, and thus their constructions of risk. These may be at odds \nwith standard medical and veterinary framings, resulting in disconnects between \nofficial programmes and local response. We found no sociologist, anthropologist or \npolitical scientist, for example, working on the avian influenza programmes of the \nmajor agencies. Yet there was a recognition that such perspectives were important \nin some quarters. In reflecting on the partial success of communications efforts, \none informant commented:\nThis is where the anthropological, the cultural and the social come in. This means \nlong term engagement rather than just communicating about the risk. These are the \nmore complex and nuanced issues. \nSuch a perspective, focused on the dynamics of disease and local responses, \ncasts the agenda wider than the standard outbreak-treatment-eradication mode. \nWhole ecosystems and their complex interactions must be examined, and the \nsocial-cultural-livelihood interactions must be at the centre of both diagnosis and \nresponse. Given the way the current response has been framed, structured and \nfinanced, this may prove difficult. But such a perspective may have important \nramifications for a One World, One Health perspective – in terms of disciplinary \nand professional skills, organisational arrangements, and identifying the focus for \nfunding. This is discussed further below.\nPOVERTY, LIVELIHOODS AND EQUITY\nA related narrative emphasises the distributional impact of disease burdens, rather \nthan the disease per se. It points in particular to the impacts of diseases on different \npeople, and also the impact of interventions. For, as we have already noted, avian \ninfluenza mostly affects poultry keepers in the developing world, many of whom are \npoor. The responses geared at a ‘global public good response’ – which are often \ndesigned to protect richer countries – have a disproportionate negative effect on \npoor livestock keepers. This inequality is at the heart of some of the major tensions \nover the international response. For those framing the problem as an emergency \n– and focusing on pandemic threat to humans – mass culling of chickens is seen \nas a necessary evil, which if compensated for, offers a substantial public good \nbenefit. But looked at from the perspective of those whose livelihoods at least in \npart depend on these poultry, such an intervention can be catastrophic. Clearly the \nimpacts will depend on where it happens and the alternative sources of income \nwhich might be available. Banning backyard birds in Thailand, say, has less of an \nimpact, and causes less of an uproar than it does in Vietnam or Cambodia where \neconomic and livelihood contexts are different.\nThere has been a range of excellent studies on the potential poverty impacts of \navian influenza (both the disease and its control) by researchers linked to the \nFAO (Rushton et al 2005; Epprecht et al 2007; Roland-Holst et al 2008), as well \nas sustained commitment by the European Commission, the UK Department for \nInternational Development, among others to work in this area94. Studies document \nthe distribution of poultry, the structure of the industry, the importance of poultry to \nlivelihoods and the impacts of culling, market bans and so on. Findings all point to \nthe importance of considering distributional impacts and equity in any assessment. \nThis argument is picked up most forcefully by NGO campaign group, GRAIN, which \nmakes the case that a ‘restructuring’ of the industry towards biosecure, large-scale \nunits favours the large scale corporate interests which increasingly dominate the \npoultry industry globally. This has knock-on consequences for people’s livelihoods, \nfood safety and animal welfare. This political economy of the food and farming \nindustry, where politics and corporate interests define the shape of policy, is an \narea which, again, is obscured by the technical disease focus of the medicalised \noutbreak narratives. \nAs Farmer (1996, 2001 and with Sen 2003) points out, structural inequalities \ndefine health policy and intervention and, as others point out, have done since \nthe colonial era, when medical intervention and colonial conquest were very much \npart of the same project (cf. McLeod and Lewis 1988; Vaughan 1991; Arnold 1993; \nAnderson, 1996). An attention to the wider political economy of the international \nresponse to disease is therefore critical, and one that brings up sharp dilemmas \nand uncomfortable truths for narrower technical framings.\nWith avian influenza there is a slow realisation that it is no longer an emergency. It \nis a deep rooted issue underlying the disease. But this is very slow; and is resisted. \nIt is more attractive to be doing something in emergency mode rather than investing \nin strategic thinking…Avian influenza to my mind is more a symptom of massive \nchanges in the poultry sector globally. …there have been massive increases in poultry \nand duck production. An avian influenza was bound to arise. The question is how to \nimprove the management of these sectors. Not just about the disease. Overall, we \nshould be aiming for a framework for other viruses. If this one is not it, some other will \nbe. But we are not there yet. Far from it.92\n– notably poverty, malnutrition and immune system suppression (such as through \nHIV infection). In other words, these so-called ‘hot spots’ are not isolated places \nfar from anywhere as the term might imply, but most of the developing world, and \nencompassing where most of humanity lives. As one informant explained:\n92 Interview, UK, 11 March 2008.\n93 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.\n94 See, for example: http://ec.europa.eu/world/avian_influenza/index.htm  and http://www.hpai-\nresearch.net/index.html\n4140\nAgain, the debate about poverty and equity – and the wider political economy \nquestions associated – highlights the division between those with essentially a \ndisease-focused framing of the problem and solution, and those who adopt a \nbroader, normative development perspective. With a normative position central, \nwe must ask: whose world, whose health, and which public, which good? It is \nnot ‘just’ about controlling a disease, but asking where, for whom and with what \ndistributional consequences. Gender dimensions, for example, are central, and \nimportant work supported by the European Commission highlights this (Velasco et \nal 2008)95. There are many within the actor-networks at the core of the international \nresponse who of course see these questions as central, and particularly country-\nlevel projects and programmes are focused on just these developmental challenges. \nBut sometimes this has been lost in the technical disease-focused response of the \ntrio of global outbreak narratives. Given the mandates of the FAO – development \nthrough agriculture – or the WHO – improving human health – this is surprising, but \nwitness to the strength and influence of certain framing assumptions and associated \ninterests linked to the mainstream perspectives. However, as discussed further in \nsection 11, if the One World, One Health banner is not just to be a glib slogan, \nrepresenting an empty commitment to globalism devoid of politics, then these \nnormative, political issues will have to be brought back in, requiring in turn, we \nsuggest, a recasting of the outbreak narrative in some quite fundamental ways.\nACCESS AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE\nOne of the assumptions of the three international response narratives described \nearlier (veterinary, public health and pandemic preparedness) is that everyone \nplays ball; that there is a global consensus on what to do and that this can then \nbe implemented through an international architecture, based on the principles of \ncooperation and respect. This is essential to allow early detection, rapid response, \nviral change monitoring, timely manufacturing of vaccines and so on. A well-oiled, \nrules-based international machinery, with the UN technical agencies at the centre, \nis needed, it was argued by some of our informants. As a number commented, \nthe overall level of collaboration and integration surrounding the avian influenza \nresponse has been remarkable when contrasted with dismal past experiences \nof cross-UN and development agency working. For some, the avian influenza \nexperience offers a shining example of the potential of effective global governance, \nand the effectiveness of the International Health Regulations (Fidler 2005a; Fidler \nand Gostin 2006; Lee and Fidler 2007). \nBut it only requires one spanner in the works and things get difficult for this idealised \nsystem. In this case the spanner came from Indonesia, at the very epicentre of the \noutbreak, and a strident minister of health, Siti Fadilah Supari. Her book, ‘It’s Time \nFor The World To Change in the Spirit of Dignity, Equity and Transparency – Divine \nHand Behind Avian Influenza’, together with a campaign facilitated by the Malaysia-\nbased campaign NGO, Third World Network, outlined the argument that sovereign \nrights should not automatically be ceded to the international system, and the WHO \nin particular96. Viruses from Indonesia should belong to Indonesia (even if they \noriginally came from China), and that any benefits derived from using these – for \nmanufacturing vaccines or drugs in particular – should result in benefit-sharing to \nthe country of origin. The model was the recently negotiated International Treaty \nfor Plant Genetic Resources, which was seen as a major victory by campaign \nNGOs and southern governments whose arguments about corporate bio-piracy \nhad animated the debate97. \nIn the context of the avian influenza response, a focus on access rights, national \nsovereignty and benefit-sharing rather took the WHO by surprise. Surely, the \nIndonesian government would want WHO reference labs to sequence the viral \nsamples? Surely sharing of the virus and associated information would be to \neveryone’s benefit, even if a private company came up with a vaccine? Surely this \nis very different from seeds and crops? It soon became clear that this rather naïve \nresponse was inadequate. From beyond its walls the WHO was not necessarily \nseen as the benevolent protector of humanity’s health. Some saw the WHO as \npart of the problem – too under the control of northern commercial and political \ninterests; in the pocket of big pharma and the US. Conspiracy theory or not, such \na view can easily take hold. \nThere has perhaps been a lack of recognition in the WHO and other parts of the UN \nsystem of changes in economic world order and the geopolitical consequences. \nIndonesia sees itself as an emerging regional power – a moderate muslim country \nwhich needs to be taken seriously. Rumour has it that Venezuela, Cuba and \nIran were ‘whispering in Indonesia’s ear’ and encouraging its stance98, as it has \nbeen advocating the independent manufacture of generic anti-viral drugs and \nconfronting the patents issues (Fidler 2005b). India argued that it could deal with its \nown avian influenza outbreak, and did not need external experts providing advice \nwhen their own capacity was sufficient99. And, since SARS, China’s role in the \nwhole international response has also been a focus of debate, with reporting and \nengagement with the international system being less than consistent.   \nWith the refusal by the Indonesian government to supply human influenza virus \nsamples or data to the international system in early 2007, the assumptions of the \ninternational governance system were put firmly to the test. High level meetings, \ndiplomatic negotiations, behind-the-scenes deals and much media speculation \ncharacterised months of tense relations, culminating in a meeting held in March \n2007 at which a deal was more-or-less brokered100. Wider discussions around \n95 See: http://ec.europa.eu/world/avian_influenza/docs/gender_study_0608_en.pdf\n96 http://www.twnside.org.sg/announcement/Joint.NGO.Statement.on.Influenza.Virus.Sharing.htm\n97 http://www.fao.org/ag/CGRFA/itpgr.htm\n98 http://www.scottmcpherson.net/journal/2007/8/1/singapore-meeting-might-return-us-to-those-\nthrilling-days-of.html\n99 http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/WHO-Commends-Indias-Bird-Flu-Response-8125-1/\n100 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr09/en/index.html; see also Nature (2006a);(2006b)\n4342\nthe access to research data, and the establishment of the OFFLU network (the \njoint OIE-FAO network of expertise on avian influenza) by Dr Ilaria Capua101 have \nsent strong signals about the importance of transparency. Commitments are now \nin place for transparent sharing of data and virus samples, and an initial global \ninfluenza virus tracking system has been launched by the WHO102. But the test will \nbe in the practice, particularly if a pandemic emerges.\nThe lessons from this episode are less about the mechanics of virus and information \nsharing than the political consequences, and the implications this has for visions \nof global governance. The WHO’s position at the centre of the network has to \nbe earned, and respect and recognition of new important economic and political \nplayers must be part of this. As one informant observed:\nThe virus sharing controversy was a shock. WHO is old style, not transparent. People \nare not impressed by symbols any more. Even the Red Cross. They are not impressed \nby doctors and big organisations. This is a good thing, but problems arise103.\nAnother observed:\nThat is a very delicate one… the issue of IHR and sharing of information is really, \nreally critical…when we are talking about a world that is so interconnected I think \nit’s difficult to use the word sovereignty in areas where there is a potential for spread \nbeyond boundaries104.\nAnother reflected:\nIt [the virus sharing issue] has been very awkward. WHO has been seen to be at fault, \nas far as member states are concerned. So it is difficult for WHO to intervene. It is an \nunusual situation…Yes, the system did need overhauling. For 50 years people did not \nrealise that viruses got shared, and handed on to pharma companies…But the issue \nwas not brought forward in a way that the multilateral system is able to deal with105.\nThe broader reconfiguration of the geo-politics of health policy has ramifications \nacross the policy process. A focus on access and rights – particularly for those who \nhad not normally been at the table, notably big pharma and northern governments \n– suggest another important reframing of the debate making the simple formulations \nof ‘global governance’, and the associated slogan of ‘One World, One Health’, \nmore difficult to realise than perhaps was first envisaged.\n101 http://www.offlu.net/organisation.php\n102 http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/aivirus_tracking_system/en/index.html; although \nthe effectiveness of the deal was being questioned, see: http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-\nenglish/2007/August/20070813131101lcnirellep0.6877405.html\n103 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\n104 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.\n105 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\nAll of these alternative narratives are being actively debated within the organisations \nat the core of the international response actor network. But they are to date \nhaving limited purchase on the mainstream outbreak narratives. However, as the \ninternational avian influenza response continues to unfold, the consensus is always \nopen to disturbance, as the virus sharing controversy dramatically showed. At the \nend of this paper we will return to the suggestive implications of these alternative \nnarratives, and explore what they imply for a programmatic definition of the One \nWorld, One Health agenda in terms that move beyond simplistic globalism and the \noutbreak narrative. \n8. ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS \nThe avian influenza response involves a huge array of institutions, initiatives, \nprogrammes and projects. Acronyms fly in a bewildering mix. AHIF, AHITF, CFIA, \nCIDRAP, CMC-AH, DFID, EC, ECDC, ECTAD, EMPRES, EPR, FAO, GAINS,GF-\nTADS, GIS-AID, GLEWS,GOARN, GPAI, IPAPI, JICA, , OIE, OFFLU, PAHO, \nPHRD, PIC, SFERA, UNICEF, UNSIC, USAID, USDA, USCDC, WFP, WHO, \nWIC and many, many others are all involved in the international response – and \nmany have been created by the new in-flows of funds106. There is much political \npositioning, turf warfaring and squabbles over mandates and funds, as we have \nseen. But this is normal practice, largely to be expected when something big \nand new arrives on the horizon, especially when attached to large amounts of \nmoney. The key question must be: is this evolving institutional and organisational \narchitecture the most effective and efficient – and does it improve resilience, and \nthe ability of the world to respond to new, uncertain, surprise-laden events? This is \na more open question. \n106 AHIF Avian and Human Influenza Facility; AHITF Avian and Human Influenza Task Force; CFIA \nCentral Fund for Influenza Action; CIDRAP Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy, \nUniversity of Minnesota; CMC-AH Crisis Management Centre for Animal Health; ECDC European \nCentre for Disease Prevention and Control; ECTAD Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal \nDiseases; EMPRES Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests \nand Diseases; EPR Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response; GAINS Global Avian Influenza \nNetwork for Surveillance; \nGF-TADS Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases; \nGIS-AID Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data; GLEWS Global Early Warning and \nResponse System for Major Animal Diseases, including Zoonoses; GOARN Global Outbreak \nAlert and Response Network; GPAI Global Program for Avian and Human Influenza Control and \nPreparedness; IPAPI International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza; OFFLU OIE/FAO \nNetwork of Expertise on Avian Influenza; PAHO Pan American Health Organization; PHRD Policy \nand Human Resources Development (World Bank-managed Japanese Trust Fund); PIC Pandemic \nInfluenza Contingency; PVS OIE Performance, Vision and Strategy; SFERA Special Fund for \nEmergency and Rehabilitation Activities; UNSIC United Nations System Influenza Coordination; \nUSCDC United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; WIC World Influenza Centre.\n4544\nWe quickly reach the limit of our system. We need expertise in the corridor to recognise \nwhat is going on. Surveillance is very different between countries: Indonesia and \nNigeria for example. For the latter, there were no reports in September. In Indonesia \nthey are looking and finding it. But again we are tracing events, not the situation in \nthe country. Reporting in X is very poor. If they report, it’s because everyone already \nknows. The key question, when it gets serious, is the high level of expertise we need \nin the corridor. It is more and more difficult to find good people107.\nThus judgement and local expertise remain key, and this is where the system \nsometimes falls down. Reluctance by veterinary services to report outbreaks, \nor farmers in fear of the consequences; the lack of field staff in-country and \npoor understanding of underlying epidemiological dynamics, all add to an air of \nuncertainty despite the fine coloured maps and interactive websites. Several people \nnoted that most of some islands of Indonesia are covered in red dots (outbreaks) \nbecause there is an intensive, and very expensive, disease search presence there \nfunded by the US. But as one informant put it: “This doesn’t mean that those bits \nof Indonesia that are blank, or other parts of the region that are not plastered with \nred dots, do not have the disease – just look at the map, it doesn’t make sense”108. \nThis realistic and honest assessment points to the basic problem of surveillance \n– if there is poor trust in veterinary services, or if field-level capacity is weak, then \nreporting is going to be patchy. The maps in many cases report, not the overall \npattern of outbreak, but the intensity and capacity of surveillance efforts.\nIn order to gain some insights into this, we start with a closer look at the surveillance, \ninformation, prediction and early warning infrastructure which has been built – or \nin most cases extended – across the core organisations. Accurate surveillance, \ntimely information, useful prediction and clear early warning are critical for any \nresponse – for avian influenza or any other epidemic. Time and accuracy is \neverything. Consequently this has been a focus of much investment in this area. \nStaff numbers associated with the ECTAD (Emergency Centre for Transboundary \nAnimal Diseases) group at FAO for example have expanded from less than ten to \naround 200 in just a few years as a direct result of avian influenza investments. \nThis group collates information from a range of sources and assesses the spread \nof animal diseases around the world. Linked to the OIE reporting system, where \nCVOs must report to Paris any notifiable animal disease, and the public health \nsurveillance system coordinated by WHO, the ECTAD group make regular updates \nand assessments to help focus the international animal health response. However, \nthose working there are realistic about what such a system can and cannot do. \n107 Interview, Rome, 1 February 2008.\n108 Interview, Rome, 1 February 2008.\nOn the human health side, things are a bit more straightforward. Hospital reporting \ntends to be reasonably accurate, and diagnosis is straightforward if samples are \nsent to a lab. But of course not every case presents at a hospital, and not all \nhospitals and clinics will send samples, although the severity of HPAI in human \nThe internal risk assessments are heavily based on expert opinion. We don’t have \nthe data to say these are valid variables. Our experience is what matters. We look at \nanecdotal things – the likelihood of reporting and so on; stories about the hiding of \ninformation – people who went to the doctor but did not say they had poultry. There \nis more risk where people are hiding. It cannot be quantified though. The long term \ngoal is to validate the variables, ideally with FAO. But now it is expert opinion and \nmany uncertainties…For example, in some places there is lots of viral circulation, but \nlittle exposure because of well constructed wet markets. But in other places it is the \nopposite. We can say – if you want to lower risk you can do this or that. Yes, we would \nlove to do it on a local basis, but the data is simply not there. We realise that things \nare different in different parts of a country. Look at China! How can you look at Tibet \nand Guangdong in the same assessment?113\n109 http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/62/6/555\n110 http://www.who.int/zoonoses/outbreaks/glews/en/index.html\n111 http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/media/nr-rp/2004/2004_gphin-rmispbk-eng.php; http://www.\npromedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1000; http://www.gideononline.com/\n112 http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/\n113 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.\n114 This was the case with a rift valley fever outbreak in Sudan for example in November 2007, \nsee: http://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_11_05/en/index.html\ncases and the level of at least reported mortalities is very high109. The WHO \nsystem involves data collection from a wide range of sources, including official \nreporting. The GLEWS network (the Global Early Warning System for Major Animal \nDiseases, including Zoonoses, a WHO-FAO-OIE partnership)110 includes scans of \nmedia reports and websites for early indications. They make use of the Canadian \nGlobal Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), which includes media and \ninternet searches across several languages, and the ProMed reporting system, \nalong with the Global Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Online Network (GIDEON) \ndatabase111. In addition, there are ‘outbreak hotlines’ which people can contact \n– an email address (with a blackberry which is reputedly responded to around \nthe clock) and a phone number. There are also inputs from informal reports by \nWHO field officers, members of the GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and Response \nNetwork)112 teams and others who are contacted when suspicions are aroused \n(Heymann and Rodier 1998, 2001, 2004). Information is one thing, but verification \nis another. Formally this has to be through notification by national governments’ \nhealth ministries – or designated WHO contact people – confirmed by lab tests, \ninitially locally, and then in WHO reference labs. But such verifications can be slow \nin coming, and WHO personnel, particularly specialists in the influenza must make \ntheir own assessments. As one informant put it: \nThus, as with some other zoonotic diseases, early information often comes from \nhuman reporting, rather than assessments of the animal health situation114. This \nis worrying, as catching things early and spotting and eradicating major avian \noutbreaks quickly is seen as central to the wider public health response. In practice, \nwe have a situation in a number of countries where the avian disease is entrenched \nand occasional human outbreaks are treated – although in a large number of cases \n4746\nthe patient dies. Monitoring this situation, however, for signs of any pandemic \npattern remains key, and so investment in surveillance systems is a top priority \n– across human and animal settings.\nA central challenge for zoonotic diseases is thus to coordinate surveillance across \nanimal and human populations. As discussed, disparities in information quality and \naccuracy make this difficult, but across the international system there is a working \nattempt. This involves daily morning tele/videoconferences between the WHO \nand FAO emergency centres (the SHOC room in Geneva and the CMC in Rome), \nwith interactions intensified with OIE and others when new outbreaks are defined. \nThere is clearly an effective, collegial interaction across the agencies, helped by \na few key individuals who have experience across the human and animal health \nareas. By all accounts this works well – and in many people’s eyes this represents \nunprecedented coordination and integration, helped along by funds to be sure, but \nalso by a committed set of professional individuals. \nBut the surveillance case presents some important organisational dilemmas. \nFirst, there is the question of coordination from local settings to global information \nsystems. This is often not effective, especially where capacities are weak and \nsuspicions are rife at the local level. As one informant put it: “What has been done \ndoes not follow a clear plan. There are overlapping mandates, rivalries, lack of \nclarity, unsustainability. There has been fudging of solutions”115.\nThis relates to wider politics of information, and fears that supplying potentially \nsensitive information will have negative consequences. This applies to farmers \nclearly, but potentially also to national authorities who fear heavy-handed intervention \nin their affairs from outside, legitimised by human health issues and the IHR of 2005. \nAs Calain (2007a, b) cogently points out, at the heart of surveillance activities there is \noften a clash of mandates and expectations, with international agencies potentially \nat loggerheads with national authorities. With global public health and wider security \nagendas deeply intertwined, the politics of surveillance is highly contentious. Such \nwider political tensions are compounded by more basic administrative and capacity \nissues at local level, with front-line health professionals resisting new surveillance \nefforts as they see redundancy and overlap in activities and competition for time, \nattention and budgets. As Calain (2007b:19) concludes, there is little doubt that the \nprofusion of surveillance efforts “is essentially geared to benefit wealthy nations”, \nmaking suspicion, reticence and low levels of commitment understandable.\nSecond, there are professional, disciplinary and organisational divides that affect \nthe cultures and practices of day-to-day activity. Vets and medics do not always have \nthe same perspectives, as we were told repeatedly in our interviews. As someone \nput it “there is that distinction I think that somehow treating the animal is less…yes, \nless noble, than treating people. So you just wait for the people to get infected!”116.\nThe thinking between vets and medics is really, really separate. It’s challenging. \nThat is a big one to overcome. It assumes there is no crossing over. The minds are \nstill that way, even if they are working on something like avian influenza. We have \nto overcome these challenges. Everything is a problem. Human doctors think it’s a \nhuman disease. But they have to be reminded it is an animal disease! On the animal \nside, they forget the human element…There is this huge diversity of thinking. The lab \nbench people get along quite well. But getting others in the room…that’s hard. When \npeople do get together, people tend to have very political discussions. We need better \ntechnical collaboration117.\n115 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.\n116 Interview, Washington DC, 13 June 2008.\nAnother observed: \nAnother commented:\nThere is mistrust between the two castes – the doctors and the vets. It has prevented \nlots of collaboration. There is a slight complex of inferiority among the vets. And there \nis a big complex of superiority among the medics118.\nThis affects the way interactions are conducted, and only when personal interactions \ntake over do such difficulties die away. This is compounded by different interpretive \nstyles, ways of assessing information and evidence and ways of framing responses. \nYet, while difficult to pinpoint, medics and vets see outbreaks in different ways: \na single case of a human may be enough to spark a reaction, yet thousands of \nchickens must die before anyone really notices. And in response terms vets have a \nwider range of actions at hand – birds can be culled, movements can be restricted \nand treatment enforced, whereas for humans draconian interventions are all a bit \nmore difficult. \nThird, there is the tricky question of what information is made public, what is kept \nquiet and how things are presented. This was a subject of some discussion with \ninformants in both WHO and FAO. While there are plenty of outbreak maps and \nalerts, these have to be understood with caution, as we have already discussed. Are \nthese presenting an accurate picture of risk or do they represent, in fact, substantial \nignorance and deep uncertainties? One informant recognised the responsibility of \nher position: “Yes, we come up with numbers. But I won’t let anyone see them. It’s very \ndangerous to release such numbers”. Thus, despite all the technical paraphernalia, \nand scientific protocols and procedures, there are after all human beings at the \ncentre of information systems. They must make judgement calls: inevitably they \nblack-box uncertainties, ignore some data, and emphasise others. This is based \non expertise and experience, which is why they have the job. But this inevitably \ncarries its own biases – personal, disciplinary, institutional. Here the ‘outbreak \nnarrative’ and an emergency framing of the response often comes into play, and \nevents (outbreaks, infection cases, mortalities) are emphasised over processes, \nand the less tangible, less easily recorded dynamics of slow spread or endemism. \n117 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.\n118 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\n4948\nFinally, there is the response to risk information and early warning alerts. Who \nbelieves it? Who wants to believe it? In studies of early warning systems in other \nfields (cf. Buchanan-Smith and Davies 1995), a ‘missing link’ between early warning \ninformation and response has often been found. As, if there is scepticism about the \ninformation, fear about the consequences and uncertainty about everything, it is \nnot surprising that some calls are not heeded. This puts pressure on those handling \ninformation, constructing maps and presenting statistics to up the ante: fear and \ndanger is always a good spur to action, it is thought. This may help, but it may also \nundermine – as people either panic or laugh at exaggerated statistics.  \nThis look at the surveillance infrastructure highlights a number of important \nfeatures of the disease response architecture today, as well as some important \ndilemmas. The emphasis on cross-border responses, and the international \ndimensions of epidemic responses are clearly significant. Disease and health is no \nlonger just a national concern. The IHR make this very clear. Ceding sovereignty \nin the face of global threats is an important wider discourse in foreign affairs and \ninternational relations thinking today. Is there a global ‘responsibility to protect’ \n– to intervene where sovereign processes are failing, on behalf of ‘humanity’? \nAre rights universal, and therefore to be upheld universally through international \njurisprudence and institutions? And does this all give excessive power and influence \nto international institutions, whose lines of accountability and forms of governance \ncan be questioned?\nAnd how should such a global response be organised? Amongst the grand talk \nof international responsibility, universal rights and humanitarianism there are \nsome more practical concerns. We have inherited a set of institutions designed \nfor a different time and a different set of purposes. The modernist, humanitarian, \ndevelopmental mission of the UN looks sometimes a bit outdated given the growth \nof new powers, the influence of transnational capital, philanthropic funding and the \ntype of challenges and threats faced today. The UN’s accreted structures look creaky, \ninefficient and expensive to many, and often grossly ineffective. Simon Maxwell \nfor example, argues that “the international system is clunky, unrepresentative and \nout of date”, that there is “system failure”119. In a similar vein, a UK government \nsubmission to the July 2008 House of Lords Select Committee report noted how \n“the current architecture is crowded and poorly coordinated. Within the diverse \ngroup of organisations there is no agreed vision or clarity over roles”120. \nMuch of this relates to the cumbersome governance structures of the UN agencies. \nWith national governments as members, and with political appointments, often \nwithout the relevant technical expertise, of permanent representatives through the \norganisations, it is not surprising that national or regional bloc interests sometimes \n119 Developments Magazine http://www.developments.org.uk/articles/system-failure\n120 Diseases Know No Frontiers: How effective are Intergovernmental Organisations in controlling \ntheir spread? http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldintergov/143/143ii.pdf, \nPara 92, page 34.\novershadow global, strategic goals. A long-term squeeze on core finances, certainly \nof FAO and WHO, means special-interest politics meets stark economics in the \nrunning of these organisations. With the coffers filled through project funds, often \nwith an ‘emergency’ label, it is easy to see how strategic directions get diverted \nand organisational dysfunction emerges. Similar challenges are faced by the non-\nUN, inter-governmental organisation, the OIE. Here governments are represented \nthrough technical specialists, usually the Chief Veterinary Officer, so policy-making \nis dominated by the special interests and concerns of the veterinary profession, \nrather than political concerns. Clearly, none of these arrangements is ideal and, \nfor the case of the avian influenza response, they have clearly presented some \nsignificant obstacles.\nThese kind of complaints, and the resulting agenda for UN reform, have of course \nbeen around for decades, but there are many voices arguing for a new international \ninstitutional architecture today. In a major speech on foreign policy delivered in \nBoston in April 2008, UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, argued how a total rethink \nof the international architecture was necessary for today’s problems. Such views \nare echoed by many others, not least US Presidential candidate, Barack Obama121. \nThe often tetchy relationship between the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions is \nat the centre of this, together with the relationships between these global institutions \nand the new conventions, protocols and regulations that have emerged to provide \nfor ‘global governance’. Does the system need a total overhaul, almost a starting \nfrom scratch, or is the current international architecture broadly ‘fit for purpose’ but \nin need of a few teaks and revisions?\nThe international response to avian influenza was perhaps a test case for this \ndebate. Did the international system adapt effectively and perform well, or is it \nin need of some major reworking? Informants we talked with had diverse views \n– scattered along a spectrum. Several were very positive. One commented: \nAvian influenza has seen some of the most effective coordination between international \nagencies I have ever encountered… people will ask: what did it all achieve? There \nwas no pandemic. But that surely is one big tick. We also can say that we looked at \nall sorts of things in new ways, and put money into veterinary systems, standards, \ndisease surveillance, PHC [primary health care] services and so on. These are all \ngood and useful things122.\n121 http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page15303.asp http://www.cgdev.org/doc/blog/obama_\nstrengthen_security.pdf\n122 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.\n123 http://www.fao.org/pbe/pbee/en/219/index.html\nEveryone agreed that positive lessons had emerged. In the area of animal health, \nissues of confused mandates and overlapping responsibilities had been raised \nby a recent, highly critical, external evaluation123. This questioned why the OIE \nand the FAO Animal Production and Health Division seemed to be doing similar \n5150\nthings, and argued for a clearer separation with a recapturing of the development \nagenda by the FAO, leaving the standard animal health policy matters to the OIE. \nSome went further and argued for a merging of the two into a single organisation \nto improve coordination and effectiveness, avoiding the on-going turf wars and \noverlaps. This analysis was, not surprisingly, rejected by those within the OIE and \nFAO who pointed to their distinct mandates and effective coordination, especially \naround avian influenza. As one informant put it: “[despite the criticisms], all the FAO \nhas to do right now is shout avian flu, and people will shower them with money!”124 \nAnd they had a point: once early squabbles subsided, the working relationship \nhas been relatively smooth and improving, and substantial funds followed. Another \ninformant suggested: “We are now just a normal dysfunctional family!”125 \nA more radical assessment voiced in a few quarters was that there is a need \nfor a new organisation which focuses explicitly on zoonotic emerging infectious \ndiseases, and brings together vets, medics and communication specialists under \none roof, allowing surveillance systems, information and early warning, regulatory \narrangements, capacity strengthening, scientific research and broader policy \nframeworks to become integrated and aligned in one set-up. This has a logical \nappeal. However, most of our informants (of course many with vested interests in \nsome form of the status quo) rejected such a scenario. Many pointed to what they \nfelt were the failings of UNAIDS126. One informant told us: “We did not want to make \nan institution like UNAIDS. We wanted to make something that could vaporize in a \npuff of smoke; that could create space for others.”127 \nThe formula adopted for the avian influenza crisis did not go down ‘the UNAIDS \nroute’, but involved a lighter-touch coordination group based in New York. The office \nof the UN System Influenza Coordination (UNSIC), within the UN Development \nGroup, was established, as discussed earlier, at the direct request of the Secretary \nGeneral, likely with lobbying from the then DG of WHO, Dr Lee Jong-wook. The \nassumption was that this would provide a coordination, profile-boosting and fund-\nraising function, which would have direct links to WHO in Geneva, which, it was \nassumed, would take on the main implementation activities, as this was framed at \nthat point very much as a public health pandemic threat. \nThis of course did not happen, and for good reason. The veterinarians, while slow \nto get going by many accounts and being ‘poor at politics’, were soon accepted \nas important players. And because of the Japanese funding deal, UNICEF was \nbrought into the fold. Much to the resentment of many in the UN system, the \nWorld Bank was brought on board too (it had first formed a bank wide team in \nOctober 2005, and had a major seat at the first international conference in Geneva \n124 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.\n125 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.\n126 See the recent independent evaluation: http://www.unaids.org/en/AboutUNAIDS/\nIndependantEvaluation/default.asp\n127 Interview, London 27 February 2008.\nin November), with a special trust fund established to manage grants and loans. \nThe World Bank, it was argued, brought different expertise and capacity to the \ntable – offering both an overall economic development outlook and transparent and \naccountable funding mechanisms which were easy to manage and report on. One \nBank insider commented:\nThe Bank had something to offer, but it was intangible. Sometimes it was knowledge, \nsometimes it was just to bring a bit of order in a process where people had really \nstrong technical views and needed a little help to put it together…The Bank is good at \ncross-sectoral, institutional issues, looking at things from an economic perspective and \navian influenza touches so many different sectors… But the Bank can be portrayed \nas a non-technical agency strutting about telling everyone what to do. We’d say we \nare just articulating a framework that can be supported financially. But there’s a fine \nline between setting up the architecture and pushing everyone inside the building and \ntelling them they have to live there128.\nDavid Nabarro, who was given the job as Senior UN System Coordinator in \nSeptember 2005, proved a brilliant networker and facilitator. While different people \nhave (very) different views about his role, all acknowledged his political acumen \nand energy129. UNSIC then became a focal point, envisaged by those inside as \nfacilitating a ‘movement’ within and beyond the UN:\n128 Interview, Washington DC 12 June 2008.\n129 Examples of positive commentaries included: “David Nabarro was a great factor in raising the \nfunds. He is very effective at loosening the purse strings. UNSIC is a real focus for the effort and \npolicy. David’s tub thumping speeches helped raise the profile” (Interview, London, 25 January \n2008); “The role played by UNSIC has been very significant. You have someone that can network \nand pull people together so easily, this is something that we need to better understand how we can \nuse this model in the future for coordination. It is a coordination function and also an energising \nfunction, and one that ensures communalities are shared… there’s been the recognition that there \nare quantifiable merits with the model - cost is miniscule and the benefits are extremely significant, \nbut it requires a mandate.” (Interview, New York, 9 June 2008). There were detractors too: “UNISC \nis now becoming irrelevant, that’s my personal view, but communications between agencies is now \nbetter, even if UNSIC is not co-ordinating it.” (Interview, New York, 9 June 2008). See also Cheng \nand Nabarro (2006) and the recent evaluation of UNSIC (Willitts-King, Smith and Sims, 2008).\n130 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.\nThe relentless efforts by David Nabarro have kept things moving. The Action Plan \nwas an attempt at a coordinated approach: 12 agencies. It had never been done \nbefore. A great achievement, it created bridges. WHO is now being harassed by other \norganisations to allow them to get involved…All agencies now want to be involved \n– tourism, migration, civil aviation etc. Everyone wants to be involved in global health \nissues. This is good. It breaks down barriers. Even if UNSIC stops something will be \nleft behind. A movement has been created130.\nThis framing, which avoids models of a fixed, permanent organisation, is interesting \nand strategic. The focus was on facilitation, on ideas, on getting people talking to \neach other, on building bridges sometimes over huge gulfs – and raising money. \n5352\nNormally I am sceptical, not excited about what we do. Here we are doing something \nimportant. Long term. This is a process that will mark a period of history…There is \na need to be flexible, so that people can pull institutions with them. Not very much \nhas been formalised… It is an interesting moment. We have been lucky: 15 - 20 \ncommitted individuals made the difference131.\nUNSIC did a very good job, bringing organisations closer together, defining tasks for \nthe core organisations, getting the issue onto the political agenda in many countries. \nNow, three years further on, I am not so convinced of the added value of UNSIC, \ntrying to get out of coordinating and into a leading role. This is not their job - they \nshould be leading with agenda setting, defining priorities, with the World Bank132.\nThe movement metaphor provided UNSIC with a vision and mission – in the \nsystem, yet outside; cooperating, yet challenging. There was genuine excitement \nand enthusiasm: this was the future.\nThe sense of personal connection and commitment was apparent too. As someone \nclosely involved reflected: “It wasn’t enough to say here is something for the global \npublic good. We first had to build relationships”133. Others commented on the way \na network was built:\nThey got to know each other too. You get a community of involved people… Everybody, \neverybody is there. The main donors, the countries, US, Japan, the European \nCommission, the UK, Canada, Australia, in terms of the very active ones. And then \nthe main organisations - OIE, WHO, FAO. They are all on first name terms now134.\n131 Interview, Brussels, 4 March 2008.\n132 Interview, London, 13 May 2008.\n133 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.\n134 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.\nSeveral years on, there are widely divergent views on the UNSIC experience. Some \nargue that this is a model for the future of the UN, and should be central to any UN \nreform strategy. It allows coordination across agencies – and, critically, beyond the \nUN – it allows funds to flow efficiently and be properly managed, and it allows the \ntechnical agencies to do what they do best. Others disagreed. They saw gradual \n‘mission creep’ and interference in what should be technical mandates of technical \nagencies by those who did not know what they were talking about. They saw funds \nbeing managed by the World Bank trust funds and not them, and, they argued, \na reduction in core funding to the technical agencies which became increasingly \nreliant on short-term loan based funding from World Bank managed sources. \nAnd they saw competition for power, prestige and authority. As agency mandates \nmoved to the centre they became more politicised and controlled. Whether this was \njust sour grapes of insightful analysis is difficult to tell, but the debate has certainly \ninfluenced the policy process. UNSIC remains key, but its future – or the future of \nsimilar cross-cutting coordinating bodies – remains up for debate.\nThe avian influenza response has therefore raised some fairly fundamental issues \nabout organisational arrangements and institutional architecture at the global level. \nThe coherence and coordination, though flawed, found at the global level, is not \nmatched at the local or national level. This problem is particularly acute in more aid-\ndependent countries, where projects, programmes, strategies sometimes trip over \neach other. Apparently in 2005, Vietnam had almost 800 donor missions in one \nyear135. One informant commented: “In Cambodia there are 22 donors active in the \nhealth sector. There are over 200 NGOs also and 109 projects.  You can imagine \nhow useful it would be if everyone could work in a coordinated way”136.  In the \ncontext of UN reform debates, and discussions about organisational change more \ngenerally, these are familiar issues. The prospect of a one-stop-shop approach to \ncountry-level delivery by the UN may, in these circumstances, have many merits137, \nyet substantial challenges remain on the ground138. Much of the impetus for a \ncoordinated response to avian influenza indeed came from demands at the country \nlevel. However despite the successes, some major challenges for the future are \npointed to.\nFirst are strategies for managing overlap in mandate and function to ensure \nefficiency and coherence, resulting in ‘optimal redundancy’ for ‘high reliability’. \nIn highly complex dynamic situations, where surprise and uncertainty is always \npresent, designing neat organisations that can respond to all possible circumstances \nis impossible – and probably dangerous. It is necessary to accept a certain \nmessiness, which inevitably involves a level of redundancy, to ensure that a ‘high \nreliability organisation’ (Perrow 1999; Weick and Sutcliffe 2001)139, with enhanced \nsystem resilience, can respond to the inherent uncertainty. In addition to some \nlevel of redundancy, important design features include: flexible organisational \narchitecture, a commitment to experimentation, learning from failure, continuous \nreinvention as adaptive response, prioritising anticipation as well as resilience, and \nlines of authority which are clear and simple. In many respects, by default rather \nthan design, core aspects of the current avian influenza response system do mirror \nsome aspects of these features. What is needed is to enhance these further.\nSecond, as already discussed, coordination across technical areas, agencies \nand functions has been a major issue. This is a critical feature of the response \nto any zoonosis, whether avian influenza or others. Here there is a huge array \nof organisations involved. As one respondent put it: “We are working with our \n135 Comment by S. Tyson from DFID,in: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/\nldselect/ldintergov/143/143ii.pdf, para 150, page 52.\n136 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\n137 See details on the ‘Delivery as One’ pilot projects at: http://www.undg.org/?P=7 and the High \nLevel Panel report of November 2007: http://www.undg.org/archive_docs/9021-High_Level_\nPanel_Report.pdf and http://www.un.org/events/panel/\n138 The country-level studies which are currently being completed explore this issue from the \nstandpoint of different country experiences, including that of Vietnam, a pilot ‘One UN’ country. \nSee http://www.steps-centre.org/ourresearch/avianflu.html\n139 http://www.highreliability.org/index.html\n5554\ninternational partners, both NGOs and international agencies and that’s hard. \n‘Herding cats’ is the phrase we are using”140. The role of UNSIC – and the IPAPI \ngroup – have been important, but there have been blockages and constraints to \njoint working, although many have been at least partially undone over time. One \ninformant complained:\nThere is collaboration and it is useful but you’d be surprised at the looks of horror when \nyou say - wouldn’t it be a good idea if every time you had an animal case someone \nrang up the human health people so you could send out a team together and check the \npeople too. At the big meetings…what inevitably happens is that WHO makes a little \nspeech, FAO makes a little speech, David Nabarro makes a little speech, and OIE too, \nwho maintain their vigilant independence from the UN system…This sends the wrong \nmessage. The whole effort, the whole ethos of this has been to coordinate, to integrate. \nYet when we get to tell the world how well we work together, we do it individually! 141 \nWhether there needs to be more integrated organisational arrangements to \nbring things together is a much disputed point, but certainly more joint working \nand collegial interaction across divides is needed, as many informants agreed. \nFor example, Jakob Zinsstag from the Swiss Tropical Institute argues for a more \nintegrated system of local level para-veterinary and para-medical support for \nAfrica142 and others have made the case for integrated training systems, such as \njoint veterinary and medical schools143. And, in the wider pandemic preparedness \nchallenge, the set of players becomes even larger. One informant said:\nThe focus has to be not only the human and animal health side, but also these other \nelements in terms of pandemic planning, some other elements of society...Now when \nyou look at FAO, they are not going to sit there and say ‘my biggest concern is the \ncontinuation of the financial services sector’. It requires a bigger picture.144\n140 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\n141 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\n142 http://www.sti.ch/datensatzsammlung/newsletter/newslettermarch08/onehealthzinsstag.html\n143 This is an example of one the few cases of this sort of initiative: http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/\nnews/vs/oct05/index.html#dvmmph\n144 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\nThird, is the issue of mandate and responsibility. Currently mandates are largely \ntechnically defined, and present major technical, professional and disciplinary divides \nas we have discussed. These can be real obstacles to effective working, as they \nperpetuate some basic misunderstandings and prejudices; and such divides can be \nreinforced by personalities, fiefdoms and territories. The avian influenza response, \njust as any other internationally coordinated activity, has resulted in some major \n‘big men’ problems, where personality clashes have soured relationships. Many of \nthese divides have been over ownership and control of particular technical areas, \nand so funds and authority. Bringing the ‘two castes’ of vets and medics together \nin particular, but also, we would argue, social scientists of various sorts, must be a \nmajor challenge for the future, although challenging to achieve given institutional and \nprofessional histories. This may require some basic re-thinking about training (joint \nvet/medic schools or courses), re-skilling (social scientists with understandings of \nepidemiology and technical scientists with social science skills), and professional \nincentives (for joint working, publishing across sectors and disciplines and so on), \nand job descriptions/recruitment strategies (vets in WHO, and medics in FAO \nor OIE, for example, with social scientists in all organisations). One informant \npointed to the biases in the professional advice systems as currently structured:\nOne of the problems is that within veterinary advice systems, the core advisors are \nnearly all lab vets, not epidemiologists for example. These are the chief technical \nadvisers in governments and agencies. The focus is on diagnosis and detection of \nthe disease agent. This is seen as the most important thing. This is a limited view \nwhen the disease is in a population – and the population exists in a social context…\nThe lack of epidemiological and economic skills is very frustrating. The specialists \nthat exist know the exact changes of amino acids in the virus, but nothing much else. \nThe bigger picture is lost145.\nFourth, there have been some important lessons about funding: raising it, \nmanaging it and spending it. A joint approach, across agencies, to raising funds \nhas clearly been a major success (or was for a while). Major pledging events, \neven if expensive, add profile, and attract senior figures. Over 1,000 people turned \nup for the Beijing pledging conference, including more than 50 ambassadors and \nministers, from over 100 countries. This large and diverse attendance allowed \nfunding agencies, and the bureaucrats involved, to pitch for funds from pots that \nmight not otherwise exist. The high political profile of avian influenza, particularly \nfollowing US President Bush’s September 2005 speech, meant that emergency \nfunds, not just development funds, started to flow. Consequently the amounts far \nexceeded those that would be realisable under normal budget envelopes. Spending \nso much money efficiently and effectively – and on time, however, is not easy. The \nWorld Bank trust fund mechanism proved a useful approach, although some argue \nthat this diverted funds away from core activities in the technical agencies. One \nwell justified complaint, however has been that funds have tended to end up with \nthe core agencies and not with national governments. In a reflection on progress so \nfar, the technical meeting held in Rome in June 2007 concluded candidly that:\nContrary to the stated intent in Beijing to ensure that the majority of funding was \nmade available directly to countries in support of their national avian and human \ninfluenza programmes, analysis of recipients of funds indicates that less than half \nof total funding is going to countries; so far non-national recipients such as regional \norganisations and the United Nations are the main recipients of the funds that have \nbeen disbursed146.\n145 Interview, UK, 11 March 2008.\n146 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007c) http://www.fao.org/docs//eims/upload//232772/\nah668e.pdf (para 5.1b, page 29).\n5756\nThis highlights the problem of disbursement. While coordination may have been \nat least partially effective at the international level, it has rarely been so at country \nlevel. This has made project funding in the field difficult, and integration even more \nso. As mentioned before the type of funds also made a big difference. Many of the \nfunds were earmarked ‘emergency’ funds on short time frames, requiring a rapid \nspend; others were loans through the World Bank system, and so carrying with \nthem the potential for debt; and many were ‘soft’ project funds, providing plenty \nof cash, but only over short periods and without the overhead to invest in core \nsupport. The result has been a projectisation of activity which has resulted in some \nunfortunate overlaps, high transactions costs and an expansion of staff on short-\nterm, consultant-style contracts, without longer term institutional commitments.\n \nFinally, there is the question of monitoring and learning approaches and systems \nof accountability. UNSIC has provided an invaluable function of collating data and \nproviding updates on activities and expenditures. The December 2007 report is in \nmany senses exemplary, cutting, as it does, across so many fields and activities \nand involving so many people and resources147. To get a bird’s eye view (so to \nspeak) of the avian influenza response the report is clearly the first port of call. For \ndonors and others this reporting provides an important level of accountability. But \nhow much has this been just a data collation exercise, based on often unverified \ndata sources, and not one that enhances more fundamental reflection and learning \non the basis of experience? These systems seem to be less in place. The real-time \nevaluation of the FAO went through several iterations before a useful document \nemerged. Some of its key findings were then rejected by the management (notably \nthe recommendation to appoint a dedicated operations manager)148. While allowing \na detailed, forensic look at performance and practice in real time, the evaluation \ndid not seem to generate much reflection and learning – more animosity and \ndefensiveness. Indeed, donor influence had a lot to do with this. As one participant \nin the evaluation explained:\nThe US said: ‘we are only interested in containment’. This was the US rep with a \nprepared statement. ‘Get the big cannons out! Throw everything at it!’ That Iraq \nthing again. And they are by far the biggest donor…The US context is that avian \ninfluenza is a bio threat! Keep it out of the US! It’s secondary that people are dying \nelsewhere. But FAO is obliged to deal with the wider picture. Livelihoods. Trade. FAO \nis a development organisation obliged to deal with these things149.\nIn the end it is difficult to know what is being monitored against what and for whom. \nMost activities to date have been aimed at assuring donors that money has been \nspent well. But measures of impact and effectiveness – and focal points around \nwhich learning needs to be emphasised – have not been identified; and if they \n147 http://www.undg.org/docs/8097/12-18-07-UN-WB-AHI-Progress-Report-final.doc and\n148 http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=52 \n149 http://www.fao.org/pbe/pbee/en/index.html (see both main report and management response)\n  Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.\nhave been they tend to be sectorally bound, relating to a particular framing of \nresponse. A bigger questioning of effectiveness, efficiency and boosting resilience \n– and particularly the distributional effects (who wins, who loses) have not been \ninvestigated. This breeds a complacency that might have spilled over into some \nof the ‘forward look’ discussions around the ‘One World, One Health’ agenda. \nWe would argue that a more searching reflection on ‘framing assumptions’ (or in \nmonitoring and evaluation language, ‘theories of change’) is needed, and one that \nbrings in other voices and perspectives to create a wider basis for accountability, \nbeyond that required by donors. We will pick up on this theme in the conclusion.\nIn the end of course, it is difficult to assess whether the organisational architecture \nthat has evolved for the avian influenza response, incrementally, often chaotically \nand with many flaws, has worked well or not. We have not had a pandemic: that \nmay be an indicator of success, or not. Yet, the virus has spread over a large part \nof the world, and has become endemic in a number of countries where continuous \noutbreaks occur. More than two billion chickens have been slaughtered as a result \nof the interventions galvanised by the international response, with major impacts on \nbusinesses, markets and livelihoods. A number of new systems have been put in \nplace – surveillance, information management, early warning, public communication; \nand human health and veterinary services have been strengthened in some places. \nAre we therefore better prepared, more resilient than before? No-one knows.\nA fear of the unknown of course feeds into a set of concerns about ‘security’ which \nare at the heart of the debate about avian influenza. These security discourses, \nhowever, require some unpacking in order to understand their impact on the politics \nof the policy process. This is the aim of the next section.\n9. SECURITY DISCOURSES\nAs we have seen, the wider political forces – particularly in the US, but also in \nthe EU, Australia and Japan – push for a set of responses that emphasise the \nprotection of healthy rich northern populations: the virus must be kept out. Yet it is \nrealised that a simple fortress approach may not work. John Barry points out that \nthe 1918 pandemic probably originated in an army base in Kansas. As a senior \nWHO official put it: \n150 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\nWith dense populations, large amounts of virus increases the likelihood of a pandemic. \nBut a pandemic could start in a developed country. The Americans assume it will \nhappen elsewhere and the job is to keep it out. But it could start there. When can we \nsay we are prepared? Never is the answer150.\n5958\nSo, no-one is safe, anywhere. It requires a global response to an unknown threat \nin order to keep ‘the homeland’ safe. And it requires a concerted effort that goes \nbeyond the vets and medics, and narrow professional concerns, to an emphasis \non global systems that protect people and economies from huge mortalities and \ndramatic collapse. This is central to the pandemic preparedness narrative discussed \nin section 6; but it is important to go further and identify the idea of ‘security’ \nas central. \nAfter 9/11, it is not surprising that such discourse has emerged around the potential \nfor a pandemic. The threat of pandemic influenza is apparently graded higher \nthan terrorist attack in the US in terms of national security (Barry 2004). Keeping \nthe virus out of America, and dealing with it at source has been seen as a major \npriority by the US administration. The US state department, for example, makes \nthe rationale for such investment absolutely clear151. Broader international efforts \nare of course linked, and the establishment of IPAPI (International Partnership on \nAvian and Pandemic Influenza) offered an informal inter-governmental approach to \npushing agendas and coordinating funding, outside the UN system.\nMuch of this debate in the US presents a particular version of national security, \nlinked to political, public and electoral concerns in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane \nKatrina, not about disease control per se and certainly not about issues of poverty, \nequity and development. With health and foreign policy so intertwined152, and avian \ninfluenza concerns being seen as part of ‘homeland security’, the imperative to \nprotect national interests often trumps global concerns in the US. \nThe US has been important. It has been taken very seriously here.  It’s all linked with \npost 9/11 contingency planning, and Hurricane Katrina. There was a realisation that \nthe country really needed to get itself organised for this sort of event153.\n151 See the January 2006 report to Congress, http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/59025.\npdf as well as the main Department of State site, http://www.state.gov/g/avianflu/.

Interventions that then followed aimed to check this \nflow, and reduce this threat. Health planning around avian influenza in Europe \nand North America is very much seen in this vein, with Departments of Health \nworking with civil contingency units and homeland security branches, in, for \nexample, the US State Department or the UK’s Cabinet Office155. Risk registers, \ncovering all perceived risks to health and security are compiled and reviewed at the \nhighest level. \nDiscourses of security have of course intersected with concerns about health and \ndisease for a long time. Close associations between disease control and colonial \nconquest have been widely discussed (cf. King 2002), as have investments by the \nmilitary in research on infectious diseases, particularly relating to the tropics where \ntroops might serve, or where source material for bioterrorism could emerge (Khardori \n2006). This organisational and institutional architecture goes beyond the core public \nagencies discussed in the previous section. Thus, US investments in the high security \nforeign animal disease lab at Plum Island have largely been driven by homeland \nsecurity concerns156. Major conferences on bioterrorism, and no doubt extensive, but \nclassified, policy discussions have occurred in the past years, with avian influenza \nbeing a focus for attention157. With defence and homeland security spending less \nconstrained than that for veterinary or public health, these concerns have had \nsignificant effects both on the framing of the debate and the funding of responses. \nBut there is not one single framing of security. Historically, different versions have \nbeen evident (Hinchliffe 2007: 105, citing Collier and Lackoff 2006). From the \nseventeenth century in Europe, a national security paradigm became dominant, \nco-constructed with the emergence of monarchical states. Such states had \nsovereign territory, with borders defended by military force. Such a national, \nstate-based military security discourse has persisted, and is the basis of much \nthinking about state-making and international relations to the present. In the late \nnineteenth century, another version of security was added. This focused on the \nsecurity of populations, and in particular their health. This saw the rise of public \nhealth interventions, based on new epidemiological knowledge about the spread \nof disease. Population security, first at the level of the nation, and later, with the \nadvent of the WHO in 1948, at the global level, became an important strand of \nsecurity discourse, often intersecting with the national-military security perspective \nin important ways. In more recent times, a third version has appeared, focusing \non ‘vital systems security’. Here the focus is less on nations or populations but \nmore on the systems and routines that keep economies and societies ticking; and \nWe were told: \n155 For the UK, see the UK Resilience site: http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/pandemicflu.aspx and \nthe link to the Civil Contingencies Secretariat of the Cabinet Office; for the US, see: http://www.\npandemicflu.gov/\n156 See the 2002 Wall Street Journal article at: http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/\nbioterrorismplumisland.html\n157 In the US, the 9/11 Commission Act required a national biosurveillance system to be set up to \ncounter bioterrorist attack. See the July 2008 report of the US Government Accountability Office, \nhttp://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08960t.pdf. CIDRAP has a long list of resources on bioterrorism, \nas well as frequent news updates and links to conferences and meetings on bioterror in which \navian influenza is frequently cited, see: http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/bioprep/\nindex.html. Also see the long list of sources on the US Environmental Protection Agency site on \n‘agroterror’: http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/thom.html \n6160\nThe medical and defence establishments think in very similar ways. Doctors and \nnurses are the new army, and vaccines are the new weapons. This is a very different \nview of health security158.\nThe population-based public health security discourse is clearly very evident too, \nand central to the WHO response – and indeed much of the argument for the \nveterinary response too. Classic epidemiological arguments define populations ‘at \nrisk’, and health security aims to protect them – and protect them from affecting \nothers. And finally, ‘vital systems’ security discourses are very prevalent, particularly \nin the pandemic planning narratives and the civil contingency responses that have \ndeveloped. \nBut, because of the pliability of the term, and its high political and policy status, \n‘security’ language and thinking has permeated the debate. The meanings and \nimplications of the use of the ‘S’ word, however, are not always clear, allowing \nit to be captured at one moment by a national-military tone, and at others by a \nmore benevolent population and vital systems perspective. With security so central \nto the wider policy discourse, this slipperiness is both understandable, but also \ndangerous. A quick look through documentation on avian influenza sees security \nassociated with a range of different terms – global, homeland, national, civil, \npopulation, system, health, bio, food, human, livelihood, personal and more. Again, \nwe need to ask: whose security, against what, for what end? This is often not clear. \nFunding politics may, in the end, dominate, as a version focused on ‘homeland \nsecurity’ or ‘bioterror’ trumps other interpretations. \nA wider debate about public health and foreign affairs is related – and, in particular, \nhow another slippery term ‘global health governance’ is being defined (Fidler 2007 \na, b).  But there are perspectives on security beyond those that currently dominate. \npreparedness for emergencies. This has been key for much of the security and \ncivil contingency planning around terrorism, as well as so-called natural hazards \n– earthquakes, floods or diseases. A whole professional discipline of disaster \nplanning and management, now given more urgency by global climate change, has \nemerged focusing on making ‘vital systems’ more resilient and allowing adaptation \nin the face of shocks or stresses.  \nThe avian influenza response is interesting because the different outbreak narratives \nwhich dominate mainstream policy thinking cut across these different, historically-\nsituated versions of what is meant by ‘security’. With the emphasis on ‘homeland \nsecurity’ and bioterror, an old-fashioned national security agenda is central. This is \nextended by thinking that emphasises global security responses across borders, \nand the associated slogans such as ‘responsibility to protect’ (even though these \nmeasures are essentially to protect national territories and citizens of particular \nnation states). As one informant put it: \n158 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.\nThese relate more closely to the alternative narratives on avian influenza, which \nhave also been sidelined to date, but which may offer approaches to global health \ngovernance and security that are currently not on the table. So for example, the \nMarch 2007 Oslo Declaration of Foreign Ministers from Norway, Brazil, France, \nIndonesia, Senegal, South Africa and Thailand identified human security as an \nimportant framing for the global health debate159. A follow-up symposium identified \na wider agenda for ‘health diplomacy’160. Here issues of equity, poverty and \ndevelopment come to the fore, echoing the ‘human development’ perspective of \nUNDP. A wider concern with ethics and civic concerns was also highlighted in the \nJuly 2006 Bellagio statement. This emphasised issues of social justice, and more \nbottom up, citizen led responses, focused on basic rights161.\nAs with the disease and responses to it, there are different framings of governance \n– and notions of ‘security’. The international avian influenza response has adopted \na variety of perspectives, often reflecting particular national political and policy \ninterests. Thus the US response has been very much centred on ‘homeland \nsecurity’ – protect ‘us’ from ‘them’ at source, going beyond national borders. \nThe European perspective has similar elements, but given its largely continental \ncontext, with a steady flow of avian influenza virus into mainland Europe from the \nBalkans and beyond, there has to be a less worried tone. The actions of European \nmember states has also shown a determined focus on effective control, along with \nthe European Commission’s commitment to a wider developmental angle to the \nglobal response, building on the experience of responding to the tsunami162. There \nare other perspectives too – such as those who signed up to the Oslo Declaration \n– which frame governance and security more in terms of basic human needs and \nrights. And, as we saw in section 7, there is perhaps an emerging and assertive \nAsian perspective which argues that access, control and rights must be more widely \nshared, that having everything geared towards northern – and especially American \n– public anxieties, political concerns and capitalist interests is simply not equitable.\n \nThe IHR 2005, discussed in section 5, defined a new form of multilateral response \nto international health issues, very much framed in terms of assuring global health \nsecurity. A balance between sovereign states and individual country membership \nof international organisations like WHO and global responsibility must be found, it \nargues. This means that sometimes, for the greater global good, international action \nis required. But, as we saw, the IHR 2005, while allowing greater scope for action \n159 http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/ud/about_mfa/Minister-of-Foreign-Affairs-Jonas-Gahr-S/\nSpeeches-and-articles/2007/lancet.html?id=466469\n160 For the ‘Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative symposium, see: http://www.who.int/trade/\nsymposium/en/index.html; see also Margaret Chan, DG of WHO on health diplomacy: http://www.\nwho.int/dg/speeches/2007/130207_norway/en/index.html\n161 http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/bioethics/bellagio/index.html.

What will China announce, or not; which virus samples will be \nshared; and can big pharma be made to play ball? These are tricky questions at the \nheart of the challenge for global governance, and ones that have no easy answers. \nCurrently there is an uneasy international consensus on global health security and \nits implementation, and a range of agreed legal instruments and institutions. Yet \nthere are, within these diverse framings of ‘security’ which are largely dominated \nby the perspectives of the currently more powerful countries, attempts to recapture \na more equitable, less hegemonic version, focused on human securities, ethics \nand rights. These again ask: Whose world? Whose health? And suggest a different \nshape to politics and the political economy. As the debate moves forward, and \nother players become more assertive, the cracks and fractures in the current \nconsensus may become clearer, requiring deeper deliberation of what we really \nmean by global health governance and security.\nFor, we argue, the big questions about what to do and where in any international \nresponse to an emerging disease, as highlighted so vividly by avian influenza, mean \nthat different types of governance arrangements will be required, with different \nframings of security. It is this recurring feature of deep uncertainty and ignorance \nthat we want to probe in the next section. Does ‘the emperor’ of the international \nresponse have any clothes – or evidence-based backing for the response – and \nhow do understandings of risk and uncertainty get dealt with by experts and others \nin constructing the response?\n10. DOES THE EMPEROR HAVE ANY CLOTHES? \nRISK, UNCERTAINTY AND EXPERTISE\nCentral to any understanding of an epidemic is expertise. But the nature of that \nexpertise and the authority it carries has huge consequences for the way public \npolicy is designed. Evidence-based policy is the contemporary mantra, but what \nevidence is used, and what is ignored in the development of public policy? And in \nwhat ways is such knowledge and evidence framed? These are important questions, \nderived from a constructivist stance to science and policy. This does not mean that \nwe are arguing for a relativist perspective where anything goes, or some type of \nconspiracy theory where evidence has been hidden or results somehow fiddled. \nBut we are arguing for a more critical look at the underlying basis of constructing \narguments that influence policy – the context and practice of science and policy, \nthe framing devices used, and the way data are presented and terms used. This is \nof course a major study in its own right and we can only touch the surface. \nHowever, as the previous sections have highlighted, there are huge uncertainties \nevident (where the likelihoods of possible outcomes are not clear), and not a little \nignorance (where we don’t know what we don’t know). Some perspectives have \nnot been prominent in the policy debate, while others have taken centre stage, \nlinked with powerful people, organisations and money. Thus a study of knowledge \nin policy is also a study of power – and the construction of discourses and practices \nin particular contexts163.\nSuch knowledge politics are played out in particular around major uncertainties \nand areas of ignorance. In the past sections, we have seen a variety of examples \nrelating to causal mechanisms (viral change, reassortment and genetic dynamics), \nspread in animals (ducks, wild birds, trade), incidence (estimates of viral load, \nthe cyclical, inter-annual and seasonal patterns, and the prevalence of ‘endemic’ \nsettings), transmission (and the likelihood of human-human transmission), impact \n(on mortality rates of wild birds, domestic poultry and humans), and response \n(efficacy of bird culling, vaccination and so on in different settings). \nSuch uncertainties – or areas of ignorance – are of course widely recognised in the \nscientific and policy advice community164. One informant summed it up thus:\nIt is difficult to deal with potentially catastrophic risk, where you cannot establish the \nrisks... It’s like having an insurance policy which cannot guarantee to pay out and there \nis no way of pricing the premium. This is not a traditional infectious disease problem. \nThe normal approach of vaccine or treatment is difficult. We are talking of highly \ncontingent risk, where it is very difficult to deal with the economics of response165.\n163 Following Foucault (1997), we can see the unfolding of the avian influenza response as a study \nin biopolitics and biopower, where actors and associated networks exercise power and control \nthrough processes of framing, and practices of categorisation, ordering and governmentality (cf. \nRose 2006).\n164 Although often framed in terms of ‘risk’, cf. Dowdle (2006).\n165 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.\n166 Interview, Brussels, 3 March 2008.\nAnother commented from a different perspective:\nChildren dying in east Turkey – of course everyone gets scared… But no one can \nsay H5 is more likely to cause a pandemic than H7. Both are quite dangerous. In one \ncase handled well with media; the other was an explosion. The first challenge is this, \nwe don’t know, we must be open. My personal line - I’ve studied virology - is not to \nemphasise that this virus will cause a pandemic, but we must be honest. We never \nknow with this type of virus166.\nIn scientific articles margins of error and coefficients of variation are of course \nquoted. Yet the framing of the core ‘outbreak narrative’ responses has been, as we \nhave seen, around probabilistic risk – and an emphasis on prediction and control \n– and not a more central admission of uncertainty and ignorance. This we argue \n6564\nis problematic, even dangerous. Look at virtually any policy statement or position \npaper on avian influenza and the well-used statistics on potential mortalities are \ntrotted out. For effect these tend to be at the high end of the spectrum. Despite \nthe qualifications and conditions attached, these statistics are the ones that get \npicked up in the media and in popular treatments – in the growing library of books, \nmagazine articles and op-eds on the issue – as well as in ministers’ briefings and \npolicy proclamations. This is natural and not surprising. There is no conspiracy \ninvolved – and indeed they may be right. Better to be cautious and plan for the \nworst than use uncertainty or ignorance to do nothing: “if you accept the premise \nthat some things are beyond the reach of science, that doesn’t prevent us from \ntaking actions”, argued one informant167.\n \nHow do such framings arise? As we have seen, there have been intense political \nand bureaucratic pressures – with commitments from the President of the US \ndownwards pushing the process. There has been a jockeying for position and \nfunds in the policy debate that followed, with headline grabbing an important tactic. \nAnd there have been the workings of science advice itself within and between \norganisations involved in the avian influenza response. This is where, we suggest, \nthe light needs to be shone more brightly. For in the processes on-going within \nthe WHO, FAO, OIE, UNICEF, the World Bank and the rest, science and policy \nis inevitably mutually constructed. Science does not neatly feed into policy in an \nunproblematic and linear way, nor do politics and policy simply dominate science. \nThere is a two-way traffic. But sometimes technical ‘truths’ are not fully questioned. \nOne non-technical outsider commented:\nThe major technical premises, on which the [global] strategy was developed, \nwere never clearly articulated or well explained. That’s true for things like culling, \nvaccination, compensation…no one seems to ask stupid but hard questions, like why \nare we doing this in this way when before we were told that vaccination is no use? \nOr why are we culling in countries where the virus is endemic, because that hurts a \nwhole load of small farmers and doesn’t stop the infection spreading? So why are we \nsticking to a system that doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense?...The lack of \nuniform technical advice has been a problem - especially in-country. The agencies \ncan contradict each other. If there is a division on the technical advice it’s very difficult \nto design projects168.\nThe outbreak narratives we have discussed fit neatly into both the scientific and \npolicy cultures involved. The science, as we have seen, has been dominated by a \nparticular type of medical and veterinary perspective, reinforced by emergency and \nhumanitarian response approaches. This emphasises disease events in particular \nplaces, and the imperative to control and eradicate. Policy then responds in \nparticular ways that are well suited to bureaucratic routines and funding protocols. \nThus the political and organisational settings for science advice and policymaking \nact to exclude alternative framings, focusing instead on a particular set of outbreak \nnarratives as the core response. This process of mutual construction – which, \nas we have emphasised before, is not necessarily ‘wrong’ – acts to black-box \nuncertainty and denies forms of ignorance, and other perspectives that are difficult, \nawkward and just don’t fit. The mainstream knowledge framing is thus around ‘risk’ \n– something that can be measured– and the response, risk management – through \nsurveillance, early warning systems and treatment and control strategies, where \nknown, measured risks are minimised. \nBut this is only part of the story. What happens when we don’t know outcomes or \nlikelihoods? What happens when there are alternative framings of impacts and their \nconsequences? As we have seen above, for avian influenza this is most of the time, \nfor most situations. Here a narrow version of risk assessment is inadequate. Figure \n3 offers a diagrammatic representation of this argument, distinguishing between \ndifferent types of incertitude across two axes – knowledge about likelihoods and \noutcomes. It also highlights (in the arrows) the cognitive, procedural and institutional \npressures that influence a move towards the top left hand corner, and a focus on \na narrow approach risk assessment, and away from a more plural response to \ndifferent types of incertitude; something, we argue, would be more appropriate for \nthe avian influenza response.\nFigure 3.

In this way, scenarios, horizon scans \nand wider public deliberation always throw up multiple options – and so ambiguity. \nWhich one to choose? Wider agenda-setting processes and political imperatives \n– for action and certainty - often force closure around particular options, often \nwithout much further evidence, moving the analysis ever further towards the \ntop-left corner, where knowledge about likelihoods and outcomes are deemed \nunproblematic, and amenable to risk management. This narrow risk framing is in \nturn reinforced by certain types of modelling which use probability estimates (or \noften actually informed guesswork) to move from uncertainty to a probabilistic risk \nassessment mode. Again, there are institutional and procedural pressures for this \nmove: risk maps, decision models and insurance policies require such probabilistic \nassessments: fuzzy, complex uncertainty or ignorance just will not do. \nAll these moves are reinforced by a set of disciplinary cultures which value \nquantitative, disease-focused assessments over more complex analyses of social, \neconomic, political and ecological dynamics. In Rosenberg’s terms, the explanations \nare centred on ‘contamination’ not ‘configuration’; on outbreak events not complex \ndisease dynamics. Understanding these disciplinary and professional biases needs \nto be at the heart of any analysis. A reconfiguring of disciplinary expertise and an \ninvolvement of alternative knowledges, including that of those directly affected by \nthe disease, could, as we have suggested earlier, have a dramatic effect on the \nframing of the problem and the response, allowing alternative narratives into the \npicture. This would help to bring to the fore real uncertainties, ambiguities and \nforms of ignorance, and push policy to respond to these explicitly, rather than \nwishing such awkward, troublesome dimensions away. \nHowever, as it stands, a fairly standard, narrow risk framing – centred on three \noutbreak narratives – dominates the avian influenza response. This, as we have \nshown, emerges from a range of institutional, procedural and cognitive pressures, \nand not necessarily from ‘evidence’ per se. Science and policy is mutually \nconstructed in a particular context that acts to include and exclude through the \nexertion of power through a range of institutional and professional practices. As \nprevious sections have discussed, the three outbreak narratives we have outlined \nfocus on a ‘risk framing’ (top-left corner), with often top-down, formulaic, ‘at source’ \ninterventions following from it, backed up by a variety of mechanisms that claim \nto predict and provide risk-based assessments of early warning. These types of \nresponse are, as we have shown, reinforced by a set of biases which lie at the \nheart of response systems (and the agencies that oversee them): disciplinary, \nprocedural, administrative, bureaucratic, organisational, funding, political, and \nmore, as well as the public policy context within which such responses are \nmanufactured, notably the role of the media, public trust in expert institutions and \nthe political imperative to be seen to be doing something in an era of anxiety, worry \nand perceived threat.\nBut does this matter? Many reading this will perhaps respond – well of course, \nthat’s true, but so what? We would argue that it does matter, and that a narrow  risk \nframing that does not effectively acknowledge issues of uncertainty and ignorance \n– and the ambiguity of alternative interpretations of likelihood and outcome, can \nact to narrow our assessment and response in ways that may undermine the \neffectiveness and resilience of responses. \nHow might this happen? For example, by focusing too much attention on (well \nacknowledged) inadequate information, surveillance and early warning systems, \nwe may miss important shifts in disease ecology, and so we may be caught \nby surprise, with serious consequences. Alternative ways of thinking about \nsurveillance might not have so much focus on reporting disease events and so \nconstructing purported risk measures, but more on understanding of complex \necosystem change and holistic assessments. This may, in the end, result in better \nresponses. Similarly, recognising the ambiguities, and inherent politics between \ndifferent outcome scenarios may allow more concrete deliberation in policy circles \naround alternative, normative consequences for different options. In other words, \nasking who will be affected, where and with what implications for poverty? Such \ndistributional questions associated with different disease responses should be seen \nas central to any discussion of policy, but tend to get occluded from the analysis by \na universal risk framing.\nIn the final section we will outline some of the implications of what we define as a \n‘dynamics and distribution’ approach to tackling the ‘One World, One Health’ agenda \nin relation to some of the key avian influenza and pandemic threat intervention \npathways. This section has highlighted how expertise and framing is central to such \nan endeavour, and being explicit about what we do know and what we don’t, and \nindeed being alert to the fact that we don’t know what we don’t know, is vital if a more \nresilient response system to new disease threats is to emerge. The current default \nof a narrow risk framing – even with all the qualifications – we argue is potentially \ndangerous, blanking out as it does through a range of discursive, institutional and \ncognitive moves important ambiguities, uncertainties and forms of ignorance. \n6968\n11. ONE WORLD, ONE HEALTH?\nCHALLENGES AND IMPLICATIONS\nThe One World, One Health agenda is certainly ambitious, combining animal, \nhuman and ecosystem health in one all-encompassing approach. For some this is \nfar too big and unwieldy, potentially undermining the successes of the focused avian \ninfluenza response by trying to put too much into the pot. As one informant put it: \n“It’s a good catch phrase, but I am not sure what it means”169. Another observed: \nThese concepts need to be narrow to be viable. One World, One Health is cast to \ncover everything. It sets the imagination off but it is more important to work out what \nis viable than come up with grand concepts. Avian influenza was a ‘brand’ if you like \nthat could make a number of things happen. It allowed us to focus on something that \nwas a tangible threat and source significant amounts of money from contingency \nfunds. Talking about generic threats at the human-animal interface - zoonoses - is \nless arresting and makes it harder to draw funds down. The link with a possible \nhuman pandemic has focused things significantly170.\nFor others, it is unquestionably the way forward, requiring a radical rethinking of the \nway we respond to international health questions. An enthusiast put it thus:\nWhat it [the avian influenza response] has done is wake the world up to the fact \nthat large numbers of [new human] diseases - 75% of them - come from the animal \nkingdom. And the connections between animal health and human health are much \nmore apparent I would argue now, than they were five years ago. People have seen \nthe connections with SARS, ebola. This has really accentuated that171.\nThe big danger, everyone agrees, is if this simply becomes a repackaging exercise: \na desperate attempt to grab funds on the tail-end of the avian influenza bonanza \nby creating something that looks new. One cynic commented: “You’ll probably find \nthat it was at one time called veterinary public health; it is in fact nothing new”172. \nThe incentives for the default option are large. There are vested interests in what \nhas become a status quo – well funded avian influenza programmes, propping up \nlarge groups of staff on short-term contracts, and mini-empires which have pushed \ncertain departments and individuals into prominence. And many argue, with some \njustification as we have seen, that the avian influenza response has been successful \nand offers a good model for rolling out similar approaches to respond to a wider set \nof potential disease threats.  \n169 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.\n170 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.\n171 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.\n172 Interview, Washington DC, 13 June 2008.\nWe argue, however, that if the ‘One World, One Health’ agenda is to have any traction, \nit must not simply be old wine in new bottles, no matter how enticing the prospect \nof new cash for activities that are fast running out of funding might be. Despite \nthe tangible successes of the recent international response to avian influenza, we \nbelieve there are some important lessons that have been learned that require some \nfairly important shifts. In particular, by questioning the dominance (but not not the \nimportance or the relevance) of the three ‘outbreak narratives’, we argue for an \nopening up of the overall framing to encompass the three alternative narratives \n– on veterinary and animal health issues, on human public health and on pandemic \npreparedness – discussed in section 6. This then requires new perspectives \non appropriate organisational architectures, the understanding of ‘security’ \nand responses to uncertainty and ignorance, as sections 8 to 10 have argued. \nHere we identify ten challenges for the way ahead derived from our analysis. Again it \nshould be emphasised that, by arguing for change, in most instances we are not arguing \nagainst existing approaches, but arguing for additions, extensions and nuances. \nMANAGING ENDEMIC SITUATIONS\nAs sections 4 and 5 highlighted, much of the current veterinary and public health \nresponse is framed by a strong ‘outbreak’ narrative that emphasises the disease \nevent and the diseased area. A response strategy follows that focuses on disease \neradication. This is clearly desirable, and an emergency/crisis response is of \ncourse appropriate in many areas. But in other places it is not: the ‘model’ response \nis not appropriate in all contexts. And these areas may be significantly larger and \nmore important – for overall global disease dynamics – than originally thought. In \nareas where the disease is heavily entrenched, and effectively endemic, a different \napproach may be needed. This focuses on long-term prevention and managing \nendemism, rather than emphasising eradication pathways which may either be \nimpossible or, worse, result in more rather than less disease because of the \nconsequences of intervention measures.   \nEMBRACING UNCERTAINTY\nAs discussed in section 10, there are a variety of factors  embedded in the current \nresponse that result in the black-boxing or ignoring of uncertainty and ignorance, \nand the denial of ambivalence (or alternative perspectives). These are reinforced \nby institutional practices and the nature of expertise. But a simple risk framing – \nand risk management response – may not be enough. An approach that embraces \nuncertainty (and ignorance and ambivalence) may result in more effective and \nresilient response strategies. But this requires new forms of expertise, a more open \napproach to assessing evidence and designing responses, and new methods and \npractices to allow this to happen. This is a theme that cuts across all other areas, \nwith profound consequences. \n7170\nRETHINKING SURVEILLANCE\nThe ‘outbreak’ focus discussed above lends itself to a particular type of surveillance \nemphasising tracking disease events. This is essential and represents the basis of \nsignificant and important investment over recent years. But this, we argue, needs to \nbe complemented by ‘systemic surveillance’ that looks at the dynamics of changing \ndiseases and ecosystems, identifying triggers, dynamic shifts and potential new \nequilibria, as a range of variables in non-linear systems interact. Clearly this is \na much more difficult task and would need a combination of broad ecosystem \nassessment with modelling work, and – critically – locally based information \nsystems which pick up on local understandings of dynamic change. Surprise will \nalways be present, but understanding complex dynamics may help us prepare for it \nin ways that are more comprehensive than often after-the-event disease tracking.\nA FOCUS ON ETHICS, EQUITY AND ACCESS\nMuch of the current debate has been framed in universal, global terms: this is \na global threat requiring a global response. The One World, One Health banner \ncan be seen in these terms too. But just beneath the surface – and occasionally \npopping above it to disturb the neat global consensus – are issues of equity and \naccess. Choices of what to do, where and for whom (whose world, whose health?), \ninevitably frame and direct the pathways of response. If dominated, as to date, with \nlargely northern concerns about ‘health security’, then a response pathway will \nemerge in a particular way (around the outbreak narratives we have discussed). \nBut with other framings – say around poverty, equity and access – then a different \nresponse pathway will be more likely. Across this report, and reflecting the views \nof a number of many we discussed with, we have identified a more developmental \nfocus as key for any future agenda. This emphasises not just ‘global’ health security \nand governance in a bland, universalist sense, where the politics of access and the \nstructural inequalities inherent are obscured, but an agenda where this political \neconomy is very much more central. This will require an explicit analysis of the \nsocial distribution of risks and rewards, as well as new voices at the table, resulting \nin a more inclusive approach to agenda setting. It will allow some agencies at the \nheart of the response – and in particular the FAO and WHO – to recapture some of \ntheir core mandates, and focus attention more explicitly on these issues.\nA NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH SECURITY\nThis relates to a wider debate about the meanings and interpretations of ‘health \nsecurity’ and ‘health governance’. As discussed, these have come to mean certain \nthings, excluding other perspectives. This has happened almost by default through \nthe unfolding of the policy process and the capture of the agenda by particular \ninterests and perspectives. The global consensus – some would say fudge – has \navoided debating these sensitive and highly charged topics, particularly as the \nmajor funders of the international response have very strong views. Unless a more \nthorough debate is conducted, this consensus will remain fragile and subject to \ndisturbance. Alternative perspectives on security, particularly at the global level, \nneed to be engaged with, including those developed under the auspices of the \nOslo Declaration. A different vision of the relationship between health and foreign \naffairs may yet emerge, which the One World, One Health initiative could be a \ngood vehicle for. This may offer a reinvention of the concepts of health security and \nhealth governance in ways that are less framed by post-9/11 concerns with national \nsecurity, and consider a more holistic, development-oriented vision.\nRETHINKING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITIES\nAs we have seen, there is much talk about global governance set within assumptions \nof consensus, transparency and common vision. This universalist globalism \nis present in much of the discussion of the avian influenza response, yet often \nexcludes difficult politics and competing interests, resulting in a rather anodyne \nversion, largely unreflective of wider political processes. This global governance \nvision is enacted through grand mission statements and the instruments of \nmultilateralism, but often comes unstuck when such perspectives are not in the \ninterests of particular powerful worlds. Whether we live in a uni-polar world, one of \nnew empires (Hardt and Negri 2000), a multi-polar one of diverse emergent powers \n(Huntington 1999), or a non-polar world where no-one has much influence anymore \n(Haass 2008) is a matter for much debate, and one that matters for how global \nresponses to emerging threats such as new diseases are constructed. Assuming \nsimple, universal, global consensus will get us nowhere, as policy regimes and \ninstruments become either captured or obstructed. Thus, at the centre of any \ndebate about ways forward, must be a searching – and politically-informed – look \nat the new configuration of power and interests globally, and the way that this \naffects our understandings of governance. \nQuestions of who is accountable for what and to whom have been raised \nthroughout this paper. This has often not been clear in the international response \nto date. Financial accountability has been assured through the regular reporting \nand monitoring by the World Bank, in relation to World Bank managed trust funds. \nUNSIC too has provided rigour, but the reporting and accountability relations to \nother organisations has often not been clear. And within agencies, systems exist \nfor managing funds, controlling programmes and defining what is done too. But \nnearly all the accountability mechanisms identified refer to aid funds, and financial \naccounting systems. This is clearly important, given the huge amounts of money \nbeing spent, and such systems of upward accountability to donors has ensured \nthat money has been accurately accounted for. But this misses out on other forms \nof auditing – both horizontal across organisations and downward to those people \nwho the effort is supposed to be serving. In an international response with so many \nstrands, this may be a tall order, but if ‘global’ only means accountability upwards \nto international donors, it then is little surprise that the effort becomes framed in \n7372\nthese terms. Getting a wider stakeholder group involved, beyond the formulaic and \nritualised efforts of international ministerial meetings, must be a key challenge for \nany future efforts.  \nNEW ORGANISATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\nSections 8 and 10 highlighted how developing organisational arrangements - and \ndisciplinary, bureaucratic and other procedures - that can embrace surprise, deal \nwith uncertainty and accept ignorance, as well as being more inclusive of diverse \nsources of knowledge and innovation, are essential. With the challenges stretching \nacross ecosystem management, veterinary/animal production issues and human \nhealth and disease, some quite radical new configurations and incentive systems \n(if not organisations) will be required. For the UN, and international public system \nmore generally, this will be a challenge. UN reform has been highlighted as an \nurgent requirement for decades. But perhaps this will be an important opportunity, \nrevisiting mandates and capacities and revitalising the core UN agencies at the \ncentre of any international disease response in ways that do not entrench existing \ninterests, but allow more cross-agency working, flexibility and responsiveness. \nThe avian influenza response has demonstrated some important successes in \nthis regard, and the coordinating group, UNSIC, has in many respects offered an \nexemplary light-touch approach to facilitation, coordination and profile/fund raising \nacross – and outside – the UN system. Caveats of course apply, and the danger of \n‘mission creep’ and ‘institutional fossilisation’ are always present, but the metaphor \nof a ‘movement’, an alliance of creative and like-minded people pushing an agenda \nis one that perhaps should be maintained.  \nDISCIPLINARY AND PROFESSIONAL MIXES\nAs we have seen, the core international response has been dominated by a relatively \nnarrow disciplinary and professional group – mostly vets and medics, and a few \ncommunications specialists. There have been others too of course, but largely on \nthe margins. This has been seen as a fairly technical problem requiring a technical \nsolution, and one framed by an ‘outbreak narrative’, where a disciplinary focus \non ‘contamination’ (and eradication) trumps other ‘configurational’ perspectives, \nwhere livelihood contexts, dynamic ecologies and political economy become more \nimportant. The work by technical specialists focusing on the outbreak is clearly \nvital, and particularly revealing as understanding of molecular composition and \ngenome dynamics increases173. But, as previous parts of this report have shown, \nthese perspectives may narrow the analysis, and so constrain prognoses and \nrecommendations. We would argue that the issues highlighted above – and widely \nrecognised as important by nearly every informant we discussed with – require \nbroader disciplinary and professional frames, and particularly more emphasis on \n173 See, for example, Hatta et al (2001); Lee et al (2004). \nthe social sciences as a route to understanding the contextual factors that influence \ndisease dynamics and the effectiveness of different types of response. It was a \nsurprise to us that, within the core agencies involved in the international response, \nthere seemed to be such a limited array of expertise (and this is not just special \npleading from authors who trained as an ecologist and psychologist and work \non the social science of science-policy interactions!) But beyond extending the \ncontributions of formal expertise, we would argue that another important challenge \nwill be to democratise expertise, and extend the contributions of others, beyond the \nprofessions and outside the technical agencies and the academe, to people who are \nliving with and managing diseases on a day-to-day basis. Exposing scientific and \npolicy claims to a wide range of critique from diverse sources enhances scientific \nrigour and policy robustness. For, it is the strategies and cultural logics of people \nin disease-affected areas which must, in the end, ensure that disease control is \neffective. This will require a substantial shift in professional and organisational \ncultures, as current approaches often actively exclude and often dismiss such \nalternative forms of knowledge and expertise.  \nIMPROVING PROGRAMME DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION\nAs discussed in the rest of the paper, there have been many good investments \nas part of the international avian influenza response, with long term capacities \nimproved in a range of areas, and with emergency preparedness, at least in \nsome quarters, substantially enhanced. However, all admit there have also been \ngaps and inadequacies. There are also questions of opportunity costs: could \nthe money have been spent on something else? Are there other more pressing \npriorities that have missed out? The country studies that are being conducted as \npart of the wider study174 are revealing the complexity of programme design and \nimplementation in particular places in South East Asia, as well as the wider politics \nof resource allocation at a national level. Bigger questions are being raised about \naid effectiveness in areas where there is weak state capacity and high levels of \ncorruption. Competition over aid resources can create highly distorting effects, \nand the desired cooperation and collaboration across government departments, \nthe private sector, NGOs and civil society simply does not happen. Despite the \nincreasing coherence and integration at the international level, at the country level \nbarriers and divides generally remain as present as ever. The traditional vertical \nprogramme approach for sectoral interventions remains the preferred model. \nThis attracts resources, and may generate rents. A cross-sectoral or sector-wide \napproach has proved less enticing, and much of the effort on the ground has \nremained fragmented and duplicative. For this reason, a more targeted approach \nto programming is needed, taking in a cross-sectoral approach and attuned to \nlocal circumstance and particular local political and policy contexts. There has \nbeen a tendency for a one-size-fits-all approach, where global expertise defines \nstrategies towards disease control or public education and communication. These \n174 See www.steps-centre.org/ourresearch/avianflu.html.\n7574\nsimple approaches have often not worked well, and have to be adapted in ad hoc \nways. Making a feature of an adaptive and responsive approach up-front makes \nmore sense. This accepts the principles of subsidiarity, decentralised control in \ndesign and implementation to the lowest level appropriate. This encourages a \nmore participative approach to programme design, avoiding the worst problems of \na technical, top-down, vertical programming approach. \nASSESSING SUCCESS AND IMPACT\nCentral to any endeavour is having a vision of success – and with this some \nindicators of impact. Such visions and indicators of course follow on directly from \nthe narratives at the centre of any policy response. Thus for the outbreak narratives \nthat dominate the international avian influenza response, the vision is firmly one \nwhich centres on disease control, eradication, the prevention of avian outbreaks \nand so the prevention of a human pandemic. Indicators follow, focused on disease \nevents and incidence. But such a narrative of course, as discussed, misses out \non other alternative perspectives, focused on complex disease dynamics, poverty \nimpacts, equity and access. These suggest very different indicators and measures \nof success or impact. In sum, there is very little clarity about what success is \n(beyond the obvious need to avoid a major human pandemic), and in practice \nsuccess is often measured in terms of financial disbursement and completion of \nproject activities. We suggest that there is an urgent need for a more thorough and \non-going debate about ‘theories of change’ (or narratives in the language of this \nreport) and indicators that are meaningful. \nAs an outline for an agenda for action for the One World, One Health initiative, \nTable 1 provides a summary of the above discussion, highlighting ten areas for \naction which, we suggest, need to be addressed if the initiative is to really improve \nthe world’s ability to respond to future, uncertain zoonotic disease threats in ways \nthat are effective, equitable and resilient.\nTHEME FOCUS FOR THE HPAI \nRESPONSE\nCHALLENGES FOR THE ONE \nWORLD, ONE HEALTH AGENDA\nOutbreaks and \nendemism\nOutbreak: disease events \nand diseased areas\nMore emphasis on dynamic drivers for \n emerging diseases and endemic contexts\nRisk and \nuncertainty\nRisk – and risk \nmanagement\nThe implications of uncertainty, \nignorance and ambiguity need attention\nSurveillance \nand information\nDisease incidence and \noutbreak tracking\nMore focus on underlying dynamics of \nchange, across a range of factors to identify \n likely ‘hot spots’ and emergent diseases\nEthics, equity \nand access\nEthical, distributional and \naccess issues not central\nQuestions of equity and who gets access \n vital, asking whose world, whose health?\nHealth security A protectionist, national security stance\nA more inclusive, rights-based human \nsecurity vision\nGlobal \ngovernance \nand \naccountabilities\nA universalist, consensual \nglobalism, with upward \naccountabilities to donors \n(largely)\nA more politically realistic perspective \non governance, recognising different \ninterests and agendas, alongside a more \n inclusive form of downward accountability\nOrganisational \narrangements\nLead technical agencies \nwith defined mandates, \nbacked up with an efficient \nfunding mechanism and \nlight-touch coordination\nBuilding on the model, aiming for \n‘optimal redundancy’ without too much \noverlap and avoiding forced integration, \nbut maintaining a nimble, flexible \ncoordination ‘movement’\nDisciplines and \nprofessions\nVeterinary and health \nprofessionals dominate\nNeed for more ecologists, \nepidemiologists, economists and social \nscientists, including anthropologists, \nsociologists and political scientists.

"A detailed experimental and numerical investigation of the flow features and the self-noise of airfoils near stall and in stall has been achieved. Several airfoils of different shapes have been tested at different speeds and different angles-of-attack. The stall noise is shown to possibly have two different regimes, first a light stall and then a deep stall, with distinct noise features. Both are seen in the low frequency range and are of dipolar nature. Yet, the deep stall has extra narrow peaks which could be associated with shear layer instabilities and large scale vortex shedding. Experiments with a vertical nozzle (large aspect ratio) and a horizontal one (small aspect ratio) have also stressed the strong installation effects on the stall noise features. The two setups yield different low frequency narrow peaks for characteristic Strouhal numbers based either on the chord length or the separation bubble thickness. Possible interaction with the jet have been identified in the vertical setup. In parallel, both RANS and LES results have been obtained on the long-span NACA0012 airfoil in the large aspect ratio setup. The strong interaction with the jet has been confirmed and both the experimental wall pressure coefficient and the characteristic Strouhal numbers have been matched. The spanwise boundary conditions are also found to strongly modify the flow field and to mimic both types of experiments with small and large aspect ratios. Finally an analytical model has been developped for the low frequency range characteristics of the stall noise. It is based on Curle’s analogy for a dipole acoustically compact in the chordwise direction. It is shown to correctly capture the humps seen in the experimental spectrum provided the experimental wall pressure spectra and spanwise coherence lengths are used. Nomenclatur"
"CLINICAL QUIZ\nDiabetes and nephrotic syndrome: Answers\nRodney D Gilbert1 & Edward Hind2 & Bhumita Vadgama3\nReceived: 30 November 2016 /Accepted: 5 December 2016\n# The Author(s) 2016. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nKeywords Diabetes . Nephrotic syndrome . Nephrotic\nsyndrome genetic causes .MIDD\nAnswers to questions\nQuestion 1: How are the diabetes and renal disease con-\nnected to each other, if at all? In principle, when a patient\nhas multiple signs, symptoms or laboratory abnormalities\nthey can be explained in one of four ways:\n1) All the problems may be features of a single disease.\n2) Some of the problems may be complications or side\neffects of treatment given for one or more problems\nor diseases.\n3) One or more problems may be a complication of anoth-\ner condition.\n4) The patient may have multiple, unrelated diseases.\nThe first choice in formulating a differential diagnosis is\nusually to find a single condition to explain everything. In a\npatient with diabetes and proteinuria, the initial thought is\noften diabetic nephropathy. However, diabetic patients are\nmore likely to have conditions other than diabetic nephrop-\nathy [1]. This is particularly true in patients with short du-\nration of diabetes and good metabolic control. Our patient\nhas diabetes which is somewhat atypical for type 1 diabetes\nwith negative auto-antibodies and an unusually long\nBhoneymoon period^ with very low glycated haemoglobin\n(HbA1C) levels [2]. The renal biopsy showed focal segmen-\ntal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and she has other clinical\nfeatures, including short stature, poor effort tolerance and\nabdominal pain. One needs to consider genetic causes of\ndiabetes that may account for some or all of these features.\nThe patient had received large doses of analgesics, but the\nrenal disease is unusual for analgesic nephropathy which\ntypically presents with papillary necrosis and reduced glo-\nmerular filtration rate (GFR). The association with drugs\nother than phenacetin remains speculative [3]. Finally, the\npatient could have two or more unrelated conditions.\nQuestion 2: What further investigations should be under-\ntaken? It would be appropriate to undertake genetic testing\nfor diabetes and possibly for genetic causes of nephrotic\nsyndrome.\nQuestion 3:What is the diagnosis?Genetic testing revealed\na mutation in mitochondrial DNA, m.3243A>G, which is\nthe most common cause of maternally inherited diabetes\nand deafness (MIDD), a mitochondrial disorder character-\nized by maternally transmitted diabetes and sensorineural\ndeafness. She was also found to be heterozygous for a\nmissence variant of NPHS1, c.2746G>T; p.(Ala916Ser).\nThe patient therefore has MIDD, and the renal disease\nmay be aggravated by the NPHS1 variant.\nThis article refers to the article that can be found at http://dx.doi.org/\n10.1007/s00467-016-3558-3.\n* Rodney D Gilbert\nRodney.Gilbert@uhs.nhs.uk\n1 Southampton Children’s Hospital and University of Southampton\nSchool of Medicine, Tremona Road, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK\n2 Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Basingstoke,\nHampshire, UK\n3 Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital Southampton,\nSouthampton, UK\nPediatr Nephrol\nDOI 10.1007/s00467-016-3560-9\nDiscussion\nMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness was first described\nin 1992 [4]. It is caused in the great majority of cases by an\nadenine to guanine substitution at position 3243 of themitochon-\ndrial DNA (m.3243A>G) encoding the gene for leucine transfer\nRNA. MIDD is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2\ndiabetes, depending on the age of the patient and mode of pre-\nsentation. About 1% of cases of diabetes are thought to be caused\nby mutations in mitochondrial DNA, and the m.3243A>G mu-\ntation accounts for about 85% of these [5].\nThe key clinical features are diabetes and deafness and their\npresence in maternal relatives. As the case of our patient dem-\nonstrates, these are not always present. The diabetes usually\npresents insidiously, but in 20%of cases it presents acutely, with\nketoacidosis present in 8% of the latter cases [6]. About 75% of\ndiabetic patients with the m.3243A>G mutation have deafness,\nwhich is sensorineural and due to cochlear disease [7].\nRenal disease is common in patients with MIDD, especial-\nly females. In one series of 74 patients with MIDD, proteinuria\nwas greater in these patients than in control diabetic patients, and\nchronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or greater was four-to\nsixfold higher despite lower HbA1C, lower blood pressure and a\n3.7-fold lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy than controls [8].\nThe commonest histological pattern in patients undergoing renal\nbiopsy is FSGS, but tubulointerstitial disease and renal cysts have\nalso been described. The combination of nephropathy and deaf-\nness may lead to a mistaken diagnosis of Alport syndrome [9].\nSeveral other features present in this patient are also ex-\nplained by the m.3243A>G mutation, including short stature,\nwhich is common and caused by a deficiency of growth hor-\nmone–releasing hormone [10, 11]. Gastro-intestinal complaints\nare also common, especially constipation and pseudo-\nobstruction [5]. The inability to play competitive football is\nlikely to reflect impaired energy utilization and skeletal myop-\nathy. Cardiomyopathy, retinal macular dystrophy and stroke,\nfeatures not present in our patient, are also described.\nOur patient had early onset of several features. This is likely\nto reflect high levels of heteroplasmy for the mutant mitochon-\ndrial DNA. The severity and early onset of renal disease may\nalso be due to the presence of a heterozygous mutation in\nNPHS1. This gene codes for nephrin, an important component\nof the glomerular slit diaphragm, and homozygous mutations\ncause Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome.\nA diagnosis of MIDD has several important implications for\ntreatment. Metformin should not be used for treating the diabe-\ntes because of the increased risk of lactic acidosis. Antibiotics\nsuch as tetracyclines and chloramphenicol which interfere with\nmitochondrial function should also be avoided. Coenzyme Q10\nhas been shown to be beneficial in preventing hearing loss and\ndelaying progression of diabetes [12]. In patients who progress\nto end stage renal failure, great caution should be exercised in\nusing maternal relatives as kidney donors.\nLearning points\n& Islet cell and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibod-\nies should be tested in diabetic patients with atypical dis-\nease behaviour or features. Genetic testing should be con-\nsidered in patients who test negative for islet cell and GAD\nantibodies. A probability calculator for monogenic diabetes\nis available at http://www.diabetesgenes.org/content/mody-\nprobability-calculator .\n& Young diabetic patients with nephropathy and good diabet-\nic control are more likely to have disease other than diabetic\nnephropathy, especially if there is no diabetic retinopathy.\n& MIDDmay cause renal failure and deafness which may be\nmisdiagnosed as Alport syndrome.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons At t r ibut ion 4 .0 In te rna t ional License (h t tp : / /\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use,\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appro-\npriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\nReferences\n1.

"Acrylamide is a process contaminant already regulated in Europe whereas the toxicological effects of certain heat-induced furan derivatives such as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural are still under revision. Acrylamide, HMF and furfural content were evaluated in 113 coated fried foods provided by food services (restaurants and school canteens). Sampling included battered and breaded foods intended for frying and were grouped according to meat-products (ham & cheese, chicken nuggets), fish-products (fish sticks, fish fillets), seafood (squid rings), vegetables (onion rings), and doughs (croquettes). Acrylamide ranged between 23.8 and 130.4 μg/kg, HMF between 0.11 and 16.07 mg/kg, and furfural between 0.01 and 1.04 mg/kg. Presence of these compounds was mostly restricted to the outer part of foods (coating material), since browning reactions are sped up in the crust. Onion rings showed a significantly higher concentration than the other samples being studied. Home-style (freshly made) chicken nuggets exhibited significantly lower acrylamide content than frozen par-fried nuggets from an industrial source. This finding suggests that increasing the complexity of the formulation of the coating through the introduction of ingredients or additives aimed at improving palatability might lead to the development of heat induced process contaminants. As a consequence, the increase of harmful compounds during thermal treatment of coated food should be carefully considered during the industrial formulation of coatings. Although the recent Regulation 2017/2158 for acrylamide does not mention specific values or mitigation strategies for coated foods, its contribution to daily acrylamide exposure within the population must not be dismissed. This study involves the first systematic prospective evaluation of process contaminants in real operative conditions at food services in Spain.This research was partly funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) under the projects SAFEFRYING (AGL2015-46234-R; MINECO) and ACRINTAKE (RTI2018-094402-B-I00, MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE).Peer reviewe"

"Multilayer thermal barrier coatings are candidate materials for high temperature applications that are novel because they employ a strain accommodating interlayer. Plasma sprayed coatings of nanostructured feedstock have shown promise in this direction. Layers of nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia (nano-YSZ) and conventional YSZ were deposited on mullite substrates using the triple torch plasma reactor (TTPR), and on NiCrAlY coated steel substrates using the Praxair SG-100 plasma torch. It has been observed that a wide range of microstructures and porosities can be produced by combining these deposition techniques and varying the feedstock materials. This control over the microstructure enables the achievement of coating properties that can be tailored according to the application and environment.\\ud\n\\ud\nHeat treatment of the microstructure leads to the formation of larger pores with a significant proportion of partially molten particles. The porosity evolved from the partial sintering of the nano-agglomerates. The microstructure was evaluated using electron microscopy. The nanostructured coatings were compared to conventional YSZ coatings in terms of their microstructural development"

"L'auteur décrit d'abord une série d'équivoques « secondaires » du régime légal de règlement des conflits d'intérêts dans la province de Québec hors les services publics. Il rattache ces ambiguïtés actuelles ou virtuelles à une équivoque « fondamentale », qui est l'écartèlement entre la liberté qui doit servir de base à une société démocratique et la peur qui suscite les lois restrictives. Pour éliminer la crainte et pour redonner à la démocratie industrielle toute sa vitalité, l'auteur s'efforce de situer le conflit social (surtout industriel) dans sa véritable perspective, en décrivant sa diversité et ses conséquences utiles fort nombreuses.We shall be dealing here with the legal arrangements for the prevention or the settlement of union-management disputes over matters of interests, thus excluding conflicts over rights. The Quebec conciliation system shall be used as a case in point, since it is typical of most labour legislations in Canada and other \"free entreprise\" countries. Conflicts in public utilities shall not be dealt with, nor shall we analyse the whole picture of union-management relations, since our study is strictly juridical and theoretical in nature.Our aim is to improve labour legislation in the area of disputes settlement by pointing to a number of ambiguities and confusions in the law which should be corrected. Any body of social legislation which is not constantly improved on the basis of its obvious consequences is a dead body and a dangerous nuisance. It should be noted, however, that the most technically correct piece of legislation will yield poor results in a hypothetical climate of political tensions, antagonisms and distrust, while a less perfect body of laws will foster peace and harmony where there exist freedom, confidence and co-operation.SOME SECONDARY CONFUSIONS1. \"Arbitration\". Our \"councils of arbitration\" arbitrate nothing, inasmuch as the final award is solely a set of recommendations which have no binding power (and more often than not very little moral authority) on the parties. They constitute only the second step of the conciliation procedure.2. It might be very useful for our legislation to distinguish clearly between \"conflicts of interests\" and \"conflicts over rights\", in order to determine the proper jurisdictions (conciliator or arbitrator) and effects (binding or not) of the award, if any. Although most collective labour agreements do draw the line by stipulating compulsory arbitration of grievances, some ambiguities still remain. The main one is the tendency to assimilate \"grievances\" with \"conflicts over rights\", and to limit conflicts of interests to the pre-contract phase, while it should be obvious that many disputes arising while an agreement is in force cannot be dealt with on the basis of clear predetermined rights. Since the agreement cannot foresee and provide for every situation, conflicts of interests are bound to arise after it has been signed, and deserve the same careful discussion and honest consideration as conflicts arising at the negotiation phase prior to the signature of the agreement.3. The meaning and scope of the word \"dispute\" must be looked for, not in the Quebec Trades Disputes Act, but in the Labour Relations Act. And care must be taken not to unduly restrict the field of so-called \"conditions of employment\" nor to limit the scope of the agreements which the parties are allowed to reach, with a view to reducing the possibilities of conflict.4. \"Equity and good conscience\" are resorted to only when the law is silent or ambiguous. They are mere natural justice and common sense. And since objective economic criteria are lacking, on the whole, for the \"council of arbitration\" to make a scientifically-based award, it should be kept in mind that \"equity and good conscience\" will permit only an approximation of justice.5. Being the first step in a compulsory procedure, the conciliation officer does not have an easy job, especially when the parties are powerhouses in strategic bargaining centers and are expected to create patterns which will be followed by an industry or a region. True, he intervenes only when direct negotiations break, and at the request of one of the parties; but as an essential part of a rigid procedure, he is often seen as a hurdle to be cleared as quickly as possible, rather than as a competent friend eager and able to help. He can be imposed by either party upon the other whenever negotiations (whether seriously carried out or not) run into a deadlock. It is this very imposition that irritates some of the parties and leads them to retaliate by treating the conciliator lightly, particularly so in the hypothesis of a tense political environment. The conciliation officer will usually be more welcome in sectors where collective bargaining is new or relatively weak, or where one party is much weaker than the other. In all cases, however, the conciliator may be relatively useful he realizes that he is above all the servant of the parties themselves, and never the distributor of rules of conduct and \"solutions\" to the parties.6. The president of the \"council of arbitration\" will do a helpful job (again despite the compulsory character of the procedure) in some cases if he understands clearly that his first duty is to serve the parties, and not the minister of Labour who appoints him. He is primarily a man of conciliation, not a man of awards. He will realize this more easily if he ponders over the scarcity of sound and safe economic criteria by which he can reach not too haphazard decisions in a most complex field, economic activity. For conflicts of interests are born out of the antagonism of two freedoms which, left undefined by law, may pretend to total discretion. Such being the case, the president will never attempt to pass judgment as a magistrate would do in a court of law, but will on the contrary always be looking for the very mobile point of mutual acceptability at which the parties may agree.7. The representatives of the parties on the \"council of arbitration\" are exactly that; they should not be expected to be impartial, since their appointment is suggested by the respective parties and since they are in most cases remunerated by them. They may be assimilated to assessors trying to enlighten the president on the merits of a given viewpoint (their own) and to get the best possible deal for their party. To see them as \"arbitrators\" would be extremely misleading.8. The award of the \"council of arbitration\" is usually at best a good guess, having little claim to scientific accuracy. It is a set of recommendations, and not a judgment, since in the first place it is not binding for the parties which constitute our object of study here. Therefore, it deserves little publicity, and should never be intended to be used as precedent. It is strictly the property of the parties themselves, and should not, as a rule, be used as an instrument of public control. If made public prematurely, it may have most injurious effects on subsequent, post-arbitral negotiations, on the precarious equilibrium of the parties, on the relative flexibility of their positions, by creating false hopes on not too certain grounds and by possibly displacing artificially and arbitrarily the point of mutual acceptability and thus delaying the settlement of the dispute.THE MAIN CONFUSIONAll the above confusions may be traced to one fundamental ambiguity, one big opposition between two prime movers: liberty, on the one side, and fear, on the other. In a democratic society, the freedoms of association, professional activity, expression, enterprise and contract, among others, are held as sacred and seen as the very foundations of democracy itself. And yet, in the face of oppositions of interests (just another definition for conflicts), we are tempted to quickly throw overboard all principles, allowing ourselves instead to be governed by sheer physical fear of potential outbursts of violence. Without realizing that aggressive forms of conflict are the exception in Canada and in Quebec particularly, and possibly led by fear-mongers with an axe to grind, we are inclined to favour restrictive measures (in legislation and administration) destined to prevent conflict at all costs. Needless to say, conciliation legislation based on freedom will be diametrically opposed to another based on fear. In the first instance, the parties will be allowed to bargain on all matters which do not go against public order and safety; the preventive procedure will be optional and will provide alternatives; if for a while the procedure remains compulsory, its steps will be as few and as short as possible; and the conciliation services provided by the government will be aimed not only at prevention, but mainly at education of the parties in the intricacies of collective bargaining. In the perspective of fear, conciliation legislation shall be exactly the opposite. To prevent open conflict, the law will provide a number of time-consuming steps, with the hope that the parties will gradually \"cool off\".Unfortunately, the \"cooling-off period\" more often than not turns into a \"warming-up period\", and the procedure defeats its avowed purpose by creating or at least magnifying the object of its fear. The parties, frustrated and irritated by long delays, and compelled to stimulate their respective militancy during the protracted debates under \"public scrutiny\", are often led to uncompromising stands where flexibility could have been possible otherwise, thus multiplying the possibilities of aggressive conflict.THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CONFLICTThe fear just described has its main root in a false notion of the meaning, variety and functions of conflict, social and particularly industrial. Conflict is essentially an opposition, manifested in a good number of ways, \"diplomatic\", \"aggressive\" and possibly violent. \"Conflict and co-operation are not separable things, but phases of one process which always involves something of both\". \"Social conflict... mean[s] a struggle over values and claims to scarce Status, power and resources in which the aims of the opponents are to neutralize, injure or eliminate their rivals\". Furthermore, conflict is everywhere, and seems only partly avoidable: we have it in primary groups (family, groups of friends, neighborhood), within and between cities, associations and countries; once institutionalized, however, conflict becomes an essential element of the social structure.Industrial conflict, for instance, can be expressed in a number of ways, such as: systematic restriction of output, sabotage, excessive turnover, absenteeism or lateness, boycott, grievances, accident-proneness, waste, pilfering, unduly strict abidance by the letter of the agreement or deliberate dents into its provisions, and more aggressive and concerted forms like the strike. We exclude the lockout, which has ceased to be a tactically useful and socially acceptable mode of industrial warfare.Social conflict, despite the harm which may accompany it in some instances, has many positive functions. It is an essential element of sociation, together with co-operation. It is responsible for most of the dynamism of a social structure. It helps a group or a society rid itself of violently disagreeable features which weaken it. It provides a safety-valve for the reduction of conflict of a more violent and persistent nature; by bringing oppositions into the open, it permits their quick solution under the eye of public opinion. It increases the cohesiveness and individuality of the contestant groups. It provokes associations and coalitions which are so many forms of sociation; in a perspective of synthesis, of global social relationship, opposition ( even violent ) between individuals, groups or societies may be signally positive in its consequences.Now with regard to industrial conflict, the strike, for instance, does perform a useful function. It is, either as a fact or as a possibility, part and parcel of the collective bargaining process. \"In the last fifteen minutes of big controversies, it is the right to strike, the possibility of a strike, that is the instrument with which the controversy is settled. It is always present at the conference table. Without it, you do not have collective bargaining\". Moreover, the strike helps reduce social tensions by airing grievances, suggesting improvements and establishing a new \"order\" on more acceptable grounds.And finally, the strike is a symbol of freedom and independence. The fact that it occurs or can happen is a clear indication of the vitality of a society and of the liberty therein.CONCLUSIONThe above notions may suggest a new outlook on social and industrial conflict which would eliminate fear, restore freedom in practice and provide us with a more rational labour legislation in the specific field of disputes settlement"
"Many households in Serbia, using electric thermo-accumulation furnaces for heating, have been forced to find an alternative solution, due to a significant increase in electricity prices during the last decade. A possible solution is replacing electric heating appliances with the solid fuel-fired ones. A prototype of a new concept of thermo-accumulation solid fuel-fired furnace has been developed to meet these growing needs, providing electricity saving together with considerable environmental benefits. Two strategies for reduction of carbon monoxide emission are examined in the paper: application of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, in the form of 3 ± 0.3 mm spheres, providing further combustion of flue gases within the furnace, as well as an additional emission reduction by means of the air excess control. Experimental investigations of the catalyst influence on the conversion of carbon monoxide have been done for different operation regimes and positions of the catalyst. The paper presents selected results regarding carbon monoxide emission during wood and coal combustion. Investigations suggest a considerable effect of the catalyst and a strong influence of the catalyst position within the furnace to carbon monoxide emission reduction. In addition, experimental tests have been conducted to asses the effect of the air excess control in the furnace on carbon monoxide emission. The amount of combustion air, the flue gas flow rate, and the fuel feeding regime have been adjusted in order to keep the flue gas oxygen content in a relatively narrow range, thus obtaining controlled combustion conditions and lower carbon monoxide emission. In this way, the furnace has been made able to respond to the changes in heating needs, fuel quality and other parameters, which is advantageous in comparison with similar solid-fuel fired furnaces.

We say that x and y alternate in w if after deleting in w all\nletters but the copies of x and y we either obtain a word xyxy · · · (of even\nor odd length) or a word yxyx · · · (of even or odd length). For example, in\nthe word 23125413241362, the letters 2 and 3 alternate. So do the letters 5\nand 6, while the letters 1 and 3 do not alternate.\nA graph G = (V,E) is word-representable if there exists a word w over\nthe alphabet V such that letters x and y alternate in w if and only if\nxy is an edge in E. For example, the graph to the right in Figure 2.3\nis word-representable and one of words representing it is bcdad. Some\ngraphs are word-representable, others are not, and the minimum non-word-\nrepresentable graph is the wheel W5 shown to the left in Figure 2.2.\nWord-representable graphs are the subject of a long line of research in the\nliterature initiated in [7] by Kitaev and Pyatkin, and they are the main focus\nin the recently published book [6] by Kitaev and Lozin. A general program\nof research suggested in [6, p. 183] takes as the input a language defined, for\nexample, through pattern-avoiding words, and outputs a description of the\nclass of graphs represented by the language. For instance, as is discussed\nin [6, p. 183], the set of weakly increasing words (those avoiding the pattern\n21) defines graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an\nindependent set, so that no edge connects the clique and the independent\nset.\nIn this paper, we study graphs defined by 132-avoiding words. Our\nresearch merges the theories of word-representable graphs [6] and patterns\nin words [2, 4], the latter being a very fast growing area. A word w =\nw1w2 · · ·wn avoids the pattern 132 (resp., 123) if there are no indices 1 ≤\ni1 < i2 < i3 ≤ n such that wi1 < wi3 < wi2 (resp., wi1 < wi2 < wi3). We\nsay that a graph G is 132-representable (resp., 123-representable) if there is\na 132-avoiding (resp., 123-avoiding) word representing it. Note that for the\nlast definition to make sense, labels of graphs are supposed to be taken from\na totally ordered set. Also, when trying to 132-represent (123-represent) a\ngraph, we are allowed to label the graph in any suitable way1.\n1There is no issue with labelling when considering word-representable graphs, since all\nlabelings are equally good or bad. However, in the contexts when there is an order on\nlabels, labelling graphs in a proper way may be essential for finding a representation.\n2\n132-representable graphs\ncircle graphs\nword-representable graphs\nall graphs odd wheels W5, W7, . . . [7]\nprisms [5]\ndisjoint union of 2 comp-\nlete graphs of size 4 [8]\ntrees, cycle graphs,\ncomplete graphs\nFigure 1.1: The place of 132-representable graphs in a hierarchy of graph\nclasses\nOne of the main results in this paper is in showing that any 132-represent-\nable graph is necessarily a circle graph. A result in [8] shows that 132-\nrepresentable graphs are a strict subset of circle graphs. Also, we show\nthat trees, cycle graphs and complete graphs are 132-representable. Thus,\nthe place of 132-representable graphs in a hierarchy of graph classes is as\nshown in Figure 1.1, where we also indicate known facts that odd wheels\nare non-word-representable [7], while prisms are word-representable but not\ncircle graphs [5]. Interestingly, the studies in [8] show that the class of\n123-representable graphs, being different from the class of 132-representable\ngraphs, is also a proper subclass of circle graphs, even though not all trees are\n123-representable; all cycle graphs and complete graphs are 123-representable.\nOne should compare our results with the results on 12-representable\ngraphs obtained in [3]. These graphs are an instance of u-representable\ngraphs, a far reaching generalization of word-representable graphs, also in-\ntroduced in [3], where u is a word over {1, 2} different from 22 · · · 2. Similarly\nto the case of 132-representable graphs, labelling of graphs is important for\n12-representation. A word w 12-represents a graph G, if for any labels x\nand y, x < y, xy is an edge in G if and only if after removing all letters in\nw but x and y, we will obtain a word of the form yy · · · yxx · · ·x. Note that\nthe notions of 132-representable graphs and 12-representable graphs are not\ndirectly related (in the former case the pattern is used to give a condition on\nwords representing graphs, while in the latter case the pattern is used to de-\nfine the representation itself). It was shown in [3] that any 12-representable\ngraph is necessarily a comparability graph, while very few trees (called dou-\nble caterpillars) and almost no cycle graphs (only cycle graphs on at most\nfour vertices) are 12-representable.\n3\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give necessary defini-\ntions, notation and results to be used in the paper. In Section 3 we derive a\nkey property of words 132-representing graphs (see Theorem 3.4) and state\nits corollary, the main result in this paper, that any 132-representable graph\nis necessarily a circle graph (see Corollary 3.5). In Section 4 we not only es-\ntablish 132-representability of trees and cycle graphs, but also describe and\nenumerate all 132-representants for complete graphs. Moreover, in Section 4\nwe discuss non-132-representable graphs and give explicit 132-representation\nof graphs on four and five vertices. Finally, in Section 5 we state a number\nof suggestions for further research.\n2 Preliminaries\nGraphs. We will now review a number of basic notions/notations in graph\ntheory. In this paper, we deal with simple graphs, that is, graphs with no\nloops and no multiple edges.\nThe degree d(v) of a vertex v in a graph G is the number of edges of\nG incident with v. The complete graph on n vertices is denoted by Kn. A\ncycle graph Cn is the graph on n vertices that consists of a single cycle. A\nwheel graph Wn is the graph on n+ 1 vertices obtained from Cn by adding\nan all-adjacent vertex (apex). The wheel graph W5 is shown to the left in\nFigure 2.2.\nA prism Prn is a graph consisting of two cycles 12 · · ·n and 1\n′2′ · · ·n′,\nwhere n ≥ 3, connected by the edges ii′ for i = 1, . . . , n. For example, Pr4,\nalso known as the three-dimensional cube, is shown to the right in Figure 2.2.\n1′\n1\n2′\n2\n3′\n3\n4′\n4\nFigure 2.2: The wheel graph W5 and the prism Pr4\nFinally, a circle graph is a graph whose vertices can be associated with\nchords of a circle such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the\ncorresponding chords intersect. See Figure 2.3 for an example of a circle\n4\ngraph.\na b\nc\nd\n⇔\nc a d\nb\nFigure 2.3: A circle with four chords and the corresponding circle graph\nWords and permutations. For a finite word w, let A(w) denote the set\nof letters occurring in w, and red(w) denote the word over {1, 2, . . . , |A(w)|}\nobtained by replacing the i-th smallest letter(s) by i. We call red(w) the\nreduced form of w. Also, for any x ∈ A(w), let nw(x) denote the number\nof copies of x in w, and xi denote the i-th occurrence of x in w from left\nto right. For example, if w = 14661476212, then A(w) = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7},\nred(w) = 13441354212, and say for x = 6, nw(6) = 3. A word w is k-\nuniform if each letter in w occurs exactly k times.\nSuppose that x and y are two distinct letters in A(w). As is defined\nabove, we say that x and y alternate in w if after deleting in w all letters\nbut the copies of x and y we either obtain a word xyxy · · · (of even or odd\nlength) or a word yxyx · · · (of even or odd length). In particular, if w has a\nsingle occurrence of x and a single occurrence of y, then x and y alternate\nin w.\nA word or permutation w = w1w2 · · ·wn avoids the pattern 132 if there\nare no indices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < i3 ≤ n such that wi1 < wi3 < wi2 . For example,\nthe word 31458 avoids the pattern 132, while 3474 is not 132-avoiding (the\nsubsequence 374 in this word forms the pattern 132). It is a well-known fact\n(e.g. see [4, p. 32]) that the number of 132-avoiding permutations of length\nn is given by the n-th Catalan number cn =\n1\nn+1\n(\n2n\nn\n)\n.\nA subword of w formed by consecutive letters is called a factor of w.\nFor example, 6651 and 41 are factors of 26651141. Finally, we let [n] =\n{1, 2, . . . , n}.\nWord-representable graphs. A graph G = (V,E) is word-representable\nif there exists a word w over the alphabet A(w) = V such that x and y\nalternate in w if and only if xy ∈ E for each x ̸= y (that is, x and y are\nconnected by an edge). In this context, we say that w represents G and w\nis a word-representant for G.\n5\nIn this paper we assume that elements in V come from a totally or-\ndered alphabet, which is important for the following definition. A word-\nrepresentable graph G is 132-representable if, possibly after relabelling the\ngraph, there exists a 132-avoiding word w that represents G. In this context,\nw is called a 132-representant for G.\nFor example, if w = 43451251, then the subword induced by the letters\n1 and 2 is 121, and hence the letters 1 and 2 alternate in w, so that the\nrespective vertices are connected in G. On the other hand, the letters 1\nand 3 do not alternate in w, because removing all other letters we obtain\n311; thus, 1 and 3 are not connected in G. Figure 2.4 shows the graph\nrepresented by w. Moreover, since w is 132-avoiding, G is 132-representable\nand w is a 132-representant of G.\n5 3\n1 2\n4\nFigure 2.4: A 132-representable graph G\nWe note that labelling of a graph is important when dealing with 132-\nrepresentation, which is not the case with just word-representation since all\nlabellings are equally good or bad. For example, the fact that the (unla-\nbelled) graph A in Figure 2.5 is 132-representable is given by the labelled\nversion B of it and the 132-avoiding word 43212341. However, if we would\nlabel A to obtain the graph C in Figure 2.5, then no 132-avoiding represen-\ntation of it exists. Indeed, suppose that a 132-representant w for C exists.\nThen at least two letters in {1, 2, 3}, say x and y, x < y, must be repeated\nat least twice in w, or else there would be at least one unwanted edge in\n{12, 13, 23}. Further, because 4 is an apex, there are x’s and y’s on both\nsides of a 4 in w (the 4 must alternate with x and y), which leads to an\noccurrence x4y of the pattern 132; contradiction.\nA.\n2\n1\n4\n3\nB.\n2\n4\n1\n3\nC.\nFigure 2.5: Significance of proper labelling\nThe following result is of special importance to us.\n6\nTheorem 2.1 ([1]). A graph G is word-representable and its representation\nrequires at most two copies of each letter if and only if G is a circle graph.\nAnother relevant result is as follows.\nTheorem 2.2 ([5]). Prisms cannot be represented using at most two copies\nof each letter, but can be represented using at most three copies of each letter.\n3 132-representants\nIn this section, we discuss some properties of 132-representants.\nWe first present a simple, but useful theorem.\nTheorem 3.1. Let G be a 132-representable graph, and x be a vertex in\nG such that d(x) ≥ 2. Then for any 132-representant w of G, we have\nnw(x) ≤ 2.\nProof. Since d(x) ≥ 2, there exist vertices a and b, a > b, in G that are\nadjacent with x.\nSuppose that there are at least three copies of x in w. Then by the\ndefinition of a 132-representant, there exists a subsequence xw1xw2x in w,\nwhere for i = 1, 2, wi is a factor of w containing exactly one a, one b, and no\nx. There are three cases to consider, all of which contradict the requirement\nthat w is 132-avoiding:\n• x > a > b: bxa is a 132 pattern in w where b ∈ w1 and a ∈ w2;\n• a > b > x: xab is a 132 pattern in w where a ∈ w1 and b ∈ w2;\n• a > x > b: bax is a 132 pattern in w where b ∈ w1 and a ∈ w2.\nHence, at most two copies of x can appear in w.\nAs consequences of Theorem 3.1, we obtain the following results.\nCorollary 3.2. If each vertex in a graph G is of degree at least 2, then any\n132-representant for G is of length at most 2n.\nCorollary 3.3. Let w be a 132-representant for a graph G. If d(x) = 1 and\nthe vertex a connected to x has degree at least 2, then x occurs at most three\ntimes in w.\n7\nProof. Let w denote a 132-representant for G. Since d(a) ≥ 2, by Theo-\nrem 3.1 a occurs at most twice in w. Combining with the fact that a and x\nalternate in w, we have that x occurs at most three times in w.\nThe following theorem generalizes Theorem 3.1.\nTheorem 3.4. If a graph G is 132-representable, then there exists a 132-\navoiding word w representing G such that for any letter x in w, nw(x) ≤ 2.\nProof. Let w be a 132-representant for G. If all the vertices in G have\ndegree at least 2, then by Theorem 3.1 every letter appears in w at most\ntwice. Hence it suffices to consider the case where there exists a vertex x in\nG such that d(x) = 1. Let a be the vertex connected to x. We consider two\ncases.\n• d(a) ≥ 2. By Corollary 3.3, the letter x occurs at most three times\nin w. To prove the theorem, we assume that there are three copies of\nx in w and then we will construct a new 132-avoiding word w′ which\nalso represents G but contains only two copies of x. By Theorem 3.1,\nthere are exactly two copies of a in w. In what follows, according to\nour notation, xi denotes the i-th x and aj the j-th a in w from left to\nright, where 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 2.\nSuppose that a > x. If there are no letters between the a’s except\nfor x then a is connected only to x in G; contradiction with d(a) ≥ 2.\nThus there is a letter b ̸= x between a1 and a2 in w. If b > a > x,\nthen x1ba2 will be the pattern 132; if a > b > x, then x1a1b will form\nthe pattern 132; if a > x > b, then ba2x3 will form the pattern 132; in\neither case, there is a contradiction with the definition of w. Thus we\nmust have a < x.\nWe next construct a new 132-avoiding word w′ from w. Since there is\nno element t smaller than a to the left of a1 in w (or else, tx2a2 would\nbe the 132-pattern), we obtain that a is a left-to-right minimum in\nw (that is, no letter to the left of a is less than a). We delete all\nthree x’s and replace a1 by the factor a\n+a1a\n+ to obtain the new word\nw′, where a < a+ < a + 1. By construction of w′, if it contains an\noccurrence of the pattern 132 then this occurrence cannot involve a+\nand thus it would give an occurrence of the pattern in w; contradiction.\nMoreover, a is the only letter in w′ alternating with a+, and thus w′\n132-represents G′ obtained from G by replacing the label x by a+.\n8\n• d(a) = 1, which means that the edge xa is disconnected from the rest\nof the graph. Let w′ denote the word obtained from w by deleting a\nand x. Clearly, w′ is 132-avoiding. But then the 132-avoiding word\nn(n− 1)n(n− 1)w′, where n and n− 1 are larger than any other letter\nin A(w′), represents the graph G′ obtained from G by replacing the\nlabels a and x by n and n− 1 (in any order).\nWe can repeat the procedure described above for any other vertices of de-\ngree 1 in G to obtain the desired result.\nOne of the main results in this paper is the following statement.\nCorollary 3.5. Any 132-representable graph is a circle graph.\nProof. Let G be a 132-representable graph. By Theorem 3.4, there exists a\n132-representant w of G that contains at most two copies of each letter. By\nTheorem 2.1 G is a circle graph.\nNote that we do not know whether each circle graph is 132-representable\nor not.\n4 132-representable graphs\nIn this section, we will show that trees, cycles, and complete graphs are\n132-representable.\n4.1 Trees and cycle graphs\nTheorem 4.1. Trees are 132-representable.\nProof. We proceed by induction on the number of vertices with an additional\ncondition. The tree with only one vertex can be represented by 1. Suppose\nthat we can represent a tree with less than n vertices by a 132-avoiding\nword and the label of the root has only one occurrence and the label of the\nnon-root vertex has exactly two occurrences in the corresponding word.\nGiven a tree T with n vertices, label it in pre-order, that is, starting from\nthe root traverse the subtrees from left to right recursively. See the graph to\nthe left in Figure 4.6 for an example. Suppose that the root has r children,\nwhich means that T has r subtrees, whose roots are children of the root of\n9\nT . Denote the r trees by Ti for 1 ≤ i ≤ r from left to right and suppose\nthat the root of Ti is labeled by ni. Note that 2 ≤ n1 < n2 < · · · < nr ≤ n,\nso that for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, Ti has ni+1 − ni vertices, where nr+1 = n + 1.\nHence Ti is a tree having less than n vertices. By induction hypothesis,\nTi is 132-representable and it can be represented by a 132-avoiding word\nw(Ti) with only one copy of ni and two copies of any other letter. Let\nw = w(Tr)w(Tr−1) · · ·w(T1)1n1n2 · · ·nr. It is easy to see that w represents\nT , and in particular, the root labeled by 1 is only connected to its children.\nMoreover, since for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r the labels of Ti are smaller that the labels\nof w(Tj), we get that w is 132-avoiding. We are done.\nExample 4.2. Let T be a tree as follows. It is clearly that T has three\nsubtrees T1, T2 and T3. By Theorem 4.1, there is w(T2) = 5. Moreover, we\nhave w(T1) = 43234 and w(T3) = 87678, which can be obtained by applying\nthe inductive argument again. Hence w(T ) = 87678.5.43234.1256, where\nthe dots showing parts of w(T ) should be ignored. It is obvious that w(T )\nis 132-avoiding and it represents T .\n1\n2 5 6\n3 4 7 8\nT\n⇒\n2\n3 4\nT1\n5\nT2\n6\n7 8\nT3\nFigure 4.6: A tree T of size 8 and its subtrees\nTheorem 4.3. Cycle graphs Cn are 132-representable.\nProof. Let n ≥ 3. A path graph Pn (see Figure 4.7) is a tree, and, by the\nproof of Theorem 4.1, it can be represented by the 132-avoiding word\nw = n(n− 1)n(n− 2)(n− 1)(n− 3)(n− 2) · · · 45342312.\nLet w′ be the word obtained from w by deleting the first n in w. Then it is\neasy to see that w′ represents Cn.\n· · ·\n1 2 3 n− 1 n\nFigure 4.7: A path graph Pn\n10\nExample 4.4. 132-representants for C4 and C5, based on Corollary 4.3,\nare given in Figure 4.8.\n1 2\n34\n342312\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n45342312\nFigure 4.8: 132-representants for C4 and C5\n4.2 Complete graphs\nIn the following theorem we shall describe and enumerate all 132-representants\nfor Kn.\nTheorem 4.5. For n ≥ 1, a complete graph Kn is 132-representable. More-\nover, for n ≥ 3, there are\n2 + cn−2 +\nn∑\ni=0\nci\ndifferent 132-representants for Kn, where cn =\n1\nn+1\n(\n2n\nn\n)\nis the n-th Catalan\nnumber. Finally, K1 can be represented by a word of the form 11 · · · 1 and\nK2 by a word of the form 1212 · · · (of even or odd length) or 2121 · · · (of\neven or odd length).\nProof. Clearly, K1 can only be represented by a word of the form 11 · · · 1,\nand K2 can only be represented by a word of the form 1212 · · · (of even\nor odd length) or 2121 · · · (of even or odd length). Each of these words is\n132-avoiding.\nLet n ≥ 3. Suppose that w is a 132-representant for Kn. According to\nthe definition of a complete graph, for any 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, we have that i\nand j alternate in w. Since d(n) ≥ 2, by Theorem 3.1, there are two cases\nto consider.\nCase 1. There are exactly two copies of n in w, and w = w1nw2nw3, where\nwk is a word over [n − 1] for k = 1, 2, 3. Since for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, i and n\n11\nalternate in w, there is exactly 1 copy of i in w2, which means that w2 is\nin fact a permutation of length n − 1. Moreover, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, i must\nnot appear in w1, or i, n, n− 1 will form the pattern 132. Thus, w1 = n− 1\nor w1 = ϵ, the empty word. Similarly, we have that w3 = 1 or w3 = ϵ.\nThus, there are four subcases to consider and in each subcase, we just need\nto consider the form of w2.\nSubcase 1.1. w1 = n − 1 and w3 = 1. Thus 1 is to the left of n − 1\nin w2, since 1 and n − 1 alternate in w. For 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, i must be\nbetween 1 and n−1 in w2 since i alternates with 1 and n−1. Moreover, for\n2 ≤ i < j ≤ n−2, they are in increasing order in w2, or 1, j, i will form a 132\npattern. Hence, we obtain that w = (n− 1)nw′1 where w′ is the increasing\npermutation 12 · · ·n, and this case contributes one representation.\nSubcase 1.2. w1 = n− 1 and w3 = ϵ. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 2, i is to the left of\nn− 1 in w2, since i and n− 1 alternate in w. Hence w = (n− 1)nw\n′(n− 1)n\nwhere w′ is any 132-avoiding permutation over [n − 2]. Thus, this case\ncontributes cn−2 representations.\nSubcase 1.3. w1 = ϵ and w3 = 1. Similarly to the Subcases 1.1 and 1.2,\nwe obtain that w = nw′1 where w′ is the increasing permutation 12 · · ·n,\nand this case contributes one representation.\nSubcase 1.4. w1 = ϵ and w3 = ϵ. Here, w = nw2n where w2 is a 132-\navoiding permutation over [n − 1]. Thus, this case contributes cn−1 repre-\nsentations.\nCase 2. There is only one copy of n in w. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n− 1, suppose\nthat there are exactly two copies of i and j in w (by Theorem 3.1 there can\nbe at most two copies of each letter). Since Kn is a complete graph, we have\nthat n lies between i1 and i2 in w, and n also lies between j1 and j2 in w,\nwhere recall that, e.g. i1 and i2 denote the first and the second occurrences\nof i, respectively, in the word. Then i1, n, j2 will form the pattern 132;\ncontradiction. Using Theorem 3.1, there are two subcases to consider.\nSubcase 2.1. Every element in A(w) has only one occurrence in w. Thus, w\nis a 132-avoiding permutation over {1, 2, . . . , n}. Thus, this case contributes\ncn representations.\nSubcase 2.2. There is only one letter i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1, in A(w) that occurs\ntwice in w. Any letter in A(w) distinct from i must lie between i1 and i2\nin w. Since w is 132-avoiding, we obtain that w = i(i + 1) · · ·nw′i where\n12\nw′ is any 132-avoiding permutation over {1, 2, . . . , i − 1}. Thus, this case\ncontributes\n∑n−1\ni=1 ci−1 =\n∑n−2\ni=0 ci representations.\nBy Theorem 4.5, the initial values for the number of 132-representants\nfor Kn, starting from n = 3, are\n12, 27, 72, 213, 670, 2190, 7349, 25146, 87364, 307310, 1092200, 3915866, . . . .\nExample 4.6. For n = 3, we can see that all 12 132-representants for K3,\nordered as in the proof of Theorem 4.5, are 231231; 23123; 31231; 3123,\n3213; 123, 231, 213, 312, 321; 1231, 2312.\nA direct corollary of Theorem 4.5 is the following statement.\nCorollary 4.7. For n ≥ 3 and a 132-representant w for Kn, the length of\nw is either n, or n+ 1, or n+ 2, or n+ 3.\n4.3 Non-132-representable graphs and 132-representation of\nsmall graphs\nEach non-word-representable graph is clearly non-132-representable. In this\nsubsection we will show that the minimum (with respect to the number of\nvertices) non-word-representable graph, the wheel graph W5 given in Fig-\nure 2.2, is actually a minimum non-132-representable graph. We do not\nknow whether there exist other non-132-representable graphs on six ver-\ntices (no other non-word-representable graphs on six vertices exist). As for\nnon-132-representable but word-representable graphs, an example of those\nis prisms Prn, where n ≥ 3. The latter follows from Theorems 2.2 and 3.4.\nWe note that the complement of a 132-representable graph is not nec-\nessarily a 132-representable graph. Indeed, for example, the 132-avoiding\nword 6645342312 defines a 132-representable graph, which is disjoint union\nof a cycle and the isolated vertex 6. However, the complement of this graph\nis the wheel graph W5, which is not word-representable.\nThe following lemma allows us to restrict ourselves to considering graphs\nwithout isolated vertices when studying 132-representation.\nLemma 4.8. Let G be a graph and G′ be a graph obtained from G by adding\nan isolated vertex. Then G is 132-representable if and only if G′ is 132-\nrepresentable.\n13\nProof. If G′ is 132-represented by w then removing from w the letter corre-\nsponding to the isolated vertex we obtain a word 132-representing G.\nConversely, suppose that G is 132-represented by w and n is larger than\nany letter in w. Then we label the isolated vertex by n and note that the\nword nnw 132-represents G′.\nLemma 4.8 cannot be generalized to adding to a graph a new connected\n132-representable component instead of an isolated vertex. This follows\nfrom the fact established in [8] that disjoint union of two complete graphs\nK4 is non-132-representable, while K4 is 132-representable. However, such\na generalization can be done in a special case as recorded in the following\nsimple, but useful lemma.\nLemma 4.9. Let G1, G2, . . . , Gk be connected components of a graph G\nthat can be 132-represented by 2-uniform words w1, w2, . . . , wk, respectively.\nThen G is 132-representable (by a 2-uniform word).\nProof. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, let ai = |A(wi)| denote the number of vertices in Gi,\nand let red∗(wi) denote the word obtained from red(wi) by replacing each\nelement j, 1 ≤ j ≤ ai, by j +\n∑i−1\nm=1 am. Then the 2-uniform word\nw = red∗(wk)red\n∗(wk−1) · · · red\n∗(w1)\n132-represents G.\n2\n1\n3\n4\n432123\n2\n1\n3\n4\n4342312\n3\n2\n4\n1\n43421\n1\n4\n2\n3\n342312\n1\n3\n2\n4\n43241\n1\n4\n2\n3\n1234\n1\n2\n3\n4\n34341212\nFigure 4.9: 132-representants for graphs on four vertices\nBy Lemma 4.8, we exclude isolated vertices from our considerations in\nthe rest of this subsection. Moreover, graphs on up to three vertices are\neither trees or the cycle graph C3, and thus they are 132-representable.\n14\nFurther, there are seven graphs on four vertices which can be 132-represented\nas shown in Figure 4.9. Finally, there are 23 graphs on five vertices that\nhave no isolated vertices, and these graphs can be 132-represented as in\nFigure 4.10. Note that Lemma 4.9 was used (in a straightforward way)\nto 132-represent graphs in Figures 4.9 and 4.10 that have two connected\ncomponents.\n2 4\n5 1\n3\n45234125\n1 3\n5 4\n2\n512341\n1 2\n3 4\n5\n54321\n2 4\n1 3\n5\n545321\n4 3\n1 2\n5\n5432451\n3 5\n4 1\n2\n5432512\n4 5\n1 3\n2\n5423521\n2 3\n1 4\n5\n543521\n1 2\n3 4\n5\n5453241\n1 3\n2 5\n4\n5434251\n2 1\n3 4\n5\n5342312\n5 1\n4 3\n2\n34523125\n1 3\n2 4\n5\n5345312\n1 2\n5 4\n3\n5453121\n4 1\n5 3\n2\n5434521\n5 2\n4 3\n1\n5453421\n4 1\n3 2\n5\n3423124515\n1 2\n5 4\n3\n45342312\n1 4\n2 3\n5\n543452121\n4 3\n5 2\n1\n5454321\n1 5\n2 3\n4\n545342312\n1 4\n2 3\n5\n543452312\n4 5\n3 2\n1\n543212345\nFigure 4.10: 132-representants for graphs on five vertices (with no isolated\nvertices)\n5 Concluding remarks\nThis paper just scratches the surface of a big research direction dealing\nwith representing graphs by pattern-avoiding words. Our studies were ex-\ntended to 123-representation of graphs in [8], where more results on 132-\nrepresentable graphs were obtained as well. Further steps may be in consid-\nering longer patterns and/or patterns of other types (e.g. those described\n15\nin [2, 4]) while defining words to be used to represent graphs, and asking\nthe question on which classes of graphs can be represented in this way. Si-\nmultaneous avoidance of patterns, like avoiding the patterns 132 and 231 at\nthe same time, can be considered as well.\nTo conclude, we state the following question, solving which by exhaustive\nsearch would involve finding appropriate labelling of graphs and then con-\nsidering all words over six letter alphabet that have at most two occurrences\nof each letter.\nQuestion: Is the wheel graph W5 the only non-132-representable graph on\nsix vertices?\nAcknowledgments\nThe first author was supported by the National Science Foundation of China.\nThe second author is grateful to Bill Chen and Arthur Yang for their hos-\npitality during the author’s stay at the Center for Combinatorics at Nankai\nUniversity in November 2015.

INTRODUCTION\nAutowave vortices, or spiral waves in two-dimensions (2D),\nare types of self-organization observed in dissipative media of\nphysical [1–4], chemical [5–7], and biological nature [8–13],\nwhere wave propagation is supported by a source of energy\nstored in the medium. The common feature of all these phe-\nnomena is that they can be mathematically described, with\nvarious degrees of accuracy, by reaction-diffusion partial dif-\nferential equations,\n∂tu = f(u) +D∇\n2u, u, f ∈ Rℓ, D ∈ Rℓ×ℓ, ℓ ≥ 2, (1)\nwhere u(~r, t) = (u1, . . . uℓ)T is a column-vector of the\nreagent concentrations, f(u) = (f1, . . . fℓ)T is a column-\nvector of the reaction rates, D is the matrix of diffusion coef-\nficients, and ~r ∈ R2 is the vector of coordinates on the plane.\nThe existence of vortices is not due to singularities in the\nmedium but is determined only by development from initial\nconditions. A rigidly rotating spiral wave solution to the sys-\ntem (1) has the form\nU˜ = U(ρ(~r − ~R), ϑ(~r − ~R) + ωt− Φ), (2)\n∗Present: The University of Potsdam, Campus Golm,Department of Physics\nand Astronomy (Haus 28), Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 24/25, 14476 Potsdam,\nGermany\nwhere ρ(~r − ~R), ϑ(~r − ~R) are polar coordinates centered at\n~R, vector ~R = (X,Y )T defines the center of rotation, and Φ\nis the initial rotation phase. For a steady, i.e. rigidly rotating,\nspiral ~R and Φ are constants. The system of reference co-\nrotating with the spiral’s initial phase and angular velocity ω\naround the spiral’s center of rotation is called the system of\nreference of the spiral. In this system of reference, ~R = 0,\nΦ = 0, and the polar angle is given by θ = ϑ + ωt. In this\nframe the spiral wave solution U(ρ, θ) does not depend on\ntime and satisfies the equation\nf(U) − ωUθ +D∇\n2U = 0. (3)\nIn this equation, the unknowns are the field U(ρ, θ) and the\nscalar ω.\nA slightly perturbed steady spiral wave solution\nU˜(ρ, θ, t) = U(ρ, θ) + ǫg(ρ, θ, t), g ∈ Rℓ, 0 < ǫ≪ 1,\nsubstituted in (1), at leading order in ǫ, yields the evolution\nequation for the perturbation g,\n∂tg = ∂uf(U)g − ω∂θg+D∇\n2g.\nThus, the linear stability spectrum of a steady spiral\nLV = λV (4)\nis defined by the linearized operator\nL = D∇2 − ω∂θ + ∂uf(U). (5)\n2The operator L has critical (Re (λ) = 0) eigenvalues\nλn = inω, n = 0,±1, (6)\nwhich correspond to eigenfunctions related to equivariance of\n(1) with respect to translations and rotations, i.e. “Goldstone\nmodes” (GMs) [14–17]\nV(0) = −∂θU(ρ, θ),\nV(±1) = −\n1\n2\ne∓iθ\n(\n∂ρ ∓ iρ\n−1∂θ\n)\nU(ρ, θ). (7)\nThe stability spectra of steady spiral waves was originally ob-\ntained numerically by Barkley [16]. Subsequently the spec-\ntrum was analysed for infinite and large bounded domains by\nSandstede and Scheel [18–20] with follow-on numerical in-\nvestigations by Wheeler and Barkley [21] confirming the large\ndomain behavior of the stability spectrum.\nIn a slightly perturbed problem\n∂tu = f(u) +D∇\n2u+ ǫh, h ∈ Rℓ, 0 < ǫ≪ 1, (8)\nwhere ǫh(u, ~r, t) is some small perturbation, spiral waves\nmay drift, i.e.change rotational phase and/or center location.\nThen, the center of rotation and the initial phase are no longer\nconstants but become functions of time, ~R = ~R(t) and\nΦ = Φ(t).\nIn linear approximation, assuming that\n~˙R, Φ˙ = O(ǫ),\nthe drifting spiral wave solution can be represented as\nU˜ = U(ρ(~r− ~R(t)), ϑ(~r− ~R(t))+ωt−Φ(t))+ǫg(~r, t), (9)\nwhere ǫg(~r, t) is a small perturbation of the steady spiral\nwave solution U.\nThen, the solution perturbation g in the laboratory frame of\nreference will satisfy the linearized system\n(∂t − D∇\n2 − ∂uf(U))g\n= h(u, ~r, t)−\n1\nǫ\n( ~˙R · ∇+ Φ˙∂θ)U. (10)\nThe solvalability condition for equation (10) for g , i.e. Fred-\nholm alternative, re-written in the spiral frame of reference,\nrequires that the free term must be orthogonal to the kernel\nof the adjoint operator to L defined in (5). This leads to the\nfollowing system of equations for the drift velocities\nΦ˙ = ǫF0(~R, t), ~˙R = ǫ ~F1(~R, t). (11)\nThus, the drift velocities Φ˙ and ~˙R are determined by the\n“forces” F0 and ~F1 = (Re (F1) , Im (F1))T which, after slid-\ning averaging (more specifically, central moving average) over\nthe spiral wave rotation period, can be expressed [15] as\nFn(~R, t) = e\ninΦ\nt+π/ω∮\nt−π/ω\nωdτ\n2π\ne−inωτ\n×\n〈\nW(n)\n(\nρ(~r − ~R), ϑ(~r − ~R) + ωτ − Φ\n)\n, h(~r, τ)\n〉\n,\nn = 0,±1. (12)\n(of course, F−1 = F¯1). Here 〈· , ·〉 stands for the scalar prod-\nuct in functional space,\n〈w , v〉 =\n∫\nR2\nw(~r)Tv(~r) d2~r.\nThe kernels W(n) of convolution-type integrals in (12) are\nthe spiral wave’s response functions (RFs), i.e., the critical\neigenfunctions\nL+W(n) = µnW\n(n), (13)\nwhere\nµn = −iωn, n = 0,±1, (14)\nof the adjoint linearized operator:\nL+ = D∇2 + ω∂θ + (∂uf(U))\nT\n, (15)\nchosen to be biorthogonal\n〈\nW(j) , V(k)\n〉\n= δj,k, (16)\nto the Goldstone modes (7). Note that the RFs do not depend\non time, i.e. are functions of the coordinates only, in the co-\nrotating system of reference.\nThe asymptotic theory just outlined reduces the description\nof the smooth dynamics of spiral waves from the system of\nnonlinear partial differential equations (1) to the system of or-\ndinary differential equations (11), describing the movement\nof the core of the spiral and the shift of its angular velocity.\nSeveral qualitative results in the asymptotic theory of spiral\nand scroll dynamics have been obtained without the use of re-\nsponse functions, e.g. [15, 17, 22–30]. However, an explicit\nknowledge of RFs makes possible a quantitative description,\nwhich obviously can be much more efficient for the under-\nstanding and control of spiral wave dynamics in numerous ap-\nplications, e.g. control of re-entry in the heart.\nThe asymptotic properties of the RFs at large distances\nare crucial for convergence of the convolution integrals in\n(12). An early version of the asymptotic theory, developed\nby Keener [31] for scroll wave dynamics, considered the RFs\nasymptotically periodic in the limit ρ→∞, in much the same\nway as spiral waves are, thus requiring an artifical cut-off pro-\ncedure to tackle the divergence of the integrals in (12) follow-\ning from such an asumption.\nBased on observations and empirical data of spiral wave\ndynamics, Biktashev [14, 32] conjectured that the response\nfunctions quickly decay at large ρ, i.e. are effectively local-\nized. This conjecture implies that the integrals in (12) con-\nverge and no cut-off procedure is required.\nTo prove existence of the localized responce functions, Bik-\ntasheva et al. [33] explicitly computed them in the complex\nGinzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) for a particular set of pa-\nrameters. Those computations exploited an additional sym-\nmetry present in the CGLE, which permitted the reduction of\nthe 2D problem to the computation of 1D components. The\ncomputations were verified by numerical convergence of the\n3method with respect to the space discretisation and the size\nof the medium. Following this work, the computed RFs were\nsuccessfully used for quantitative prediction of the spiral’s res-\nonant drift and drift due to media inhomogeneity [34, 35]. By\nexplicitly computing the RFs in the CGLE for a broad range\nof the model’s parameters, Biktasheva and Biktashev [36, 37]\nshowed that the RFs are localized for stable spiral wave solu-\ntions and qualitatively change at crossing the charachteristic\nlines in the model parameter plane.\nRecently, there has been a significant theoretical progress\nin mathematical treatment of the localization of the response\nfunctions. Sandstede and Scheel [38, Corollary 4.6] analyti-\ncally proved such localization for one-dimensional wave dis-\nlocations, which may be considered as analogues of a spiral\nwave in one spatial dimension. Hopefully this can be extended\nto two spatial dimensions, i.e. to spiral waves.\nFor cardiac applications, dynamics of spiral waves in ex-\ncitable media is more important than in oscillatory media such\nas the CGLE, as most cardiac tissues are excitable. These\nmodels do not allow reduction to 1D, making quantitatively\naccurate computation of the response functions more chal-\nlenging. So far, the response functions have been computed\nin the Barkley [39, 40] and FitzHugh-Nagumo [41] models\nof excitable media. For the chosen sets of model parameters,\nthe computed RFs appeared effectively localized in the vicin-\nity of the spiral wave core. Hamm [39] and Biktasheva et\nal. [41] calculated RFs on Cartesian grids, but the accuracy\nwas not sufficient for quantitative prediction of drift. Hakim\nand Henry [40] took the advantage of a polar grid and Barkley\nmodel to compute the spiral wave solution with an accuracy\nof 10−8 and RFs with accuracy 10−6 (both in the sense of\nl2-norm of the residue of the discretized equations) leading to\nquantitative prediction of drift velocities with about 4% accu-\nracy.\nEncouraging as these results are, there is a need for a more\ncomputationally efficient, accurate and robust method to com-\npute the response functions of spiral waves in a variety of ex-\ncitable media with required accuracy. The aim of this paper\nis to present a method which is superior to previous methods\nused to compute response functions and to demonstrate that it\nworks for stationary rotating spirals in FitzHugh-Nagumo sys-\ntem. We also demonstrate convergence of the method with re-\nspect to the computational parameters, i.e. discretization steps\nand size of the medium, and show that the method is vastly\nmore efficient than the methods used before [40, 41].\nII. METHODS\nA. Computations\nTo compute the response functions, we use methods similar\nto those described in [16, 21].\nThe nonlinear problem (3) is considered on a disk ρ ≤\nρmax, with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions,\n∂ρU(ρmax, θ) = 0. The fields are discretized on a regular\npolar grid (ρj , θk) = (j∆ρ, k∆θ) where 0 < j ≤ Nρ and\n0 ≤ k < Nθ plus the center point ρ = 0. Hence there are\nNρNθ+1 grid points and correspondinglyN = ℓ(NρNθ+1)\nunknowns and the same number of equations in the discretiza-\ntion of (3). For the inner points j < Nρ, the ρ-derivatives\nare calculated via second-order central differences. The θ-\nderivatives are calculated using Fornberg’s weights.f sub-\nroutine [42] which uses all Nθ values so, in theory, provides\nan approximation of θ-derivatives of the order of Nθ. The dis-\ncretization of the Laplacian at the center point is via the differ-\nence between the average around the innermost circle ρ = ∆ρ\nand the center point, and the approximation at j = Nρ takes\ninto account the boundary conditions at ρ = ρmax.\nThe discretized nonlinear steady-state spiral problem (3)\nis solved by Newton’s method, starting from initial approx-\nimations obtained by interpolation of results of simulations of\nthe time-dependent problem (1) using EZSPIRAL. The New-\nton iterations involve inversion of the linearized matrix which\nhas a banded structure with the bandwidth 1 + 2ℓNθ. This is\nachieved by the appropriate ordering of the unknowns of the\ndiscretized problem within the N -dimensional vector of un-\nknowns, so that the index enumerating components of reagent\nvectors from Rℓ varied fastest, followed by the index enumer-\nating angular grid points k∆θ, followed by the index enumer-\nating the radial grid points j∆ρ.\nThe thus posed discretized nonlinear problem inherits the\nsymmetry of (3) with respect to rotations. To select a\nunique solution out of a family of solutions generated by\nthis symmetry, we impose a “pinning condition” of the form\nUℓ∗(j∗∆ρ, k∗∆θ) = u∗, where ℓ∗, u∗ and j∗ may be selected\narbitrarily and k∗ is chosen as the θ-grid point in the ρ = j∗∆ρ\ncircle that gives the ℓ∗-component value closest to u∗ in the\ninitial approximation. Since Uℓ∗(j∗∆ρ, k∗∆θ) is fixed, it is\nno longer an unknown, and its place in the RN -vector of un-\nknowns is taken by ω, also to be found from (3). In this way,\nthe balance of the unknowns and equations is preserved. As\nω is present in all equations, the corresponding non-zero col-\numn of the linearization matrix destroys the bandedness of the\nmatrix. This obstacle is overcome by employing the Sherman-\nMorrison formula [43] to find solutions of the corresponding\nlinear systems using only banded matrices. Newton iterations\nare performed until the residual in solution of the discretized\nversion of equation (3) becomes sufficiently small.\nThe linearized problems (4) and (13) are considered in the\nsame domain with similar boundary conditions. The critical\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of the discretized operators L\nand L+ are computed with the help of a complex shift and\nCayley transform.\nFor a matrix L, be it discretization of L or L+, the complex\nshift is defined as\nA = L+ iκI\nand the subsequent Cayley transform as\nB = (ξI+A)−1(ηI+A) (17)\nwhere κ, ξ and η are real parameters and I is the identity ma-\ntrix. If λ, α and β are eigenvalues of L, A and B, respectively,\nthis implies\nα = λ+ iκ, β =\nη + α\nξ + α\n.\n4The selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the thus con-\nstructed matrices B are then found by the Arnoldi method,\nusing ARPACK [44].\nWe have used ξ = 0, η = 1 and κ = 0,∓ω when seeking,\nrespectively, V(0,±1) and W(0,∓1), where ω is the solution\nof the corresponding nonlinear problem previously obtained.\nWith this choice of ξ, η and κ, the numerical eigenvalues λˆ\nand µˆ closest to the theoretical critical eigenvalues (6) and (14)\ncorrespondingly, generate the largest |β|. Hence, the Arnoldi\nmethod in each case is required to obtain the eigenvalue with\nthe largest absolute value.\nTo normalize the eigenvectors, we use the “analytical”\nGoldstone modes V˘(k), obtained by numerical differentiation\nof the numerical spiral wave solution Uˆ, namely,\nV˘(0) = −∂θUˆ(ρ, θ),\nV˘(±1) = −\n1\n2\ne∓iθ\n(\n∂ρ ∓ iρ\n−1∂θ\n)\nUˆ(ρ, θ),\nwhere differentiation has been implemented using the same\ndiscretization schemes as used in calculations.\nFirst, the response functions Wˆ(k) computed by ARPACK\nare normalized with respect to the “analytical” Goldstone\nmodes V˘(k) so that〈\nWˆ(k) , V˘(k)\n〉\n= 1, k = 0,±1,\nwhere numerical integration involved in 〈· , ·〉 has been carried\nout using the trapezoidal rule.\nThen, the “numerical” Goldstone modes Vˆ(k) computed by\nARPACK are normalized with respect to the normalized re-\nsponse functions so that\n〈\nWˆ(k) , Vˆ(k)\n〉\n= 1, k = 0,±1.\nThus, we finally obtain\n• a numerical solution for the spiral wave problem (3) to-\ngether with the angular velocity ω,\n• “analytical” Goldstone modes V˘(k),\n• normalized “numerical” Goldstone modes Vˆ(k), and\n• normalized response functions Wˆ(k).\nB. Analysis\nTo validate the computed response functions, we have to\ndemonstrate convergence of the solution with respect to the\nnumerical approximation parameters such as the size of the\nmedium ρmax, and the discretization steps ∆ρ and ∆θ.\nFirst of all, we have to demonstrate convergence of the\ncomputed eigenvalues of λˆn and µˆn to their theoretical values\n(6) and (14), taking forω its numerical approximation ωˆ found\nby numerical solving the discretized problem (3). Since the\n“theoretical” value for ω is not available, we can only check\nconvergence of ωˆ to some limit.\nThe accuracy of the “numerical” Goldstone modes is quan-\ntified by the distance between the “numerical” and “analyti-\ncal” Goldstone modes, in L2 norm\nDj =\n\n∫\nS\n∣∣∣V˘(j)(~r)− Vˆ(j)(~r)∣∣∣2 d2~r\n\n\n1/2\nas well as C0 norm\nD′j = max\n~r∈S\n∣∣∣V˘(j)(~r)− Vˆ(j)(~r)∣∣∣\nover a disk S of half the radius of the computational domain:\nS = {~r : |~r| ≤ ρmax/2}.\nThe smaller disk is used to exclude the effects of boundary\nconditions. The issue is that the exact GM V˘ do not satisfy\nNeumann boundary conditions whereas Vˆ do, hence there is\nan inevitable deviation between them near ρ = ρmax, which\nis an artefact of restricting our problem to a finite domain, and\nis not indicative of the accuracy of the computed Wˆ, which\nare expected to be exponentially small near ρ = ρmax.\nThe accuracy of the computed response functions Wˆ could\nbe tested directly in the same way as the accuracy of the com-\nputed ωˆ, i.e. by the numerical convergence to some limit. This\nis however, difficult to implement for the numerical solutions\nobtained on different grids. Nevertheless, we are able to ex-\namine the convergence in ∆ρ where coarser grids are subgrids\nof the finer grids by restricting the fine-grid solutions to the\ncoarse grid, without the need for any interpolation. Specifi-\ncally, we calculate\nEj =\n\n∫\nB\n∣∣∣Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r)− Wˆ(j)∆ρ∗(~r)\n∣∣∣2 d2~r\n\n\n1/2\nand\nE ′j = max\n~r∈B\n∣∣∣Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r)− Wˆ(j)∆ρ∗(~r)\n∣∣∣\nover the whole computational domain\nB = {~r : |~r| ≤ ρmax},\nwhere Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r) are the numerical response functions calcu-\nlated at the radius step ∆ρ which is an integer multiple of the\nminimal radius step ∆ρ∗, and the finest numerical response\nfunctions Wˆ(j)∆ρ∗(~r) have been restricted to the coarser grid\nof Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r) of the solution to which they are compared, so\nthe numerical integration is done over the coarser grid. Note\nthat in the series with varying ρmax and fixed ∆θ and ∆ρ, the\ncoarser grids are also subgrids of the finer grids, but as the\npinning point is defined via ρmax, solutions at different ρmax\nare again not directly comparable to each other so this series\nis not used in this comparison.\n5We also assess accuracy indirectly via the bi-orthogonality\nbetween the response functions and the Goldstone modes re-\nquired by (16). Specifically, we examine the orthogonality of\nthe RFs to the “analytical” GMs, quantified by\nOa =\n∑\nj=0,±1\n∑\nk=0,±1\n∣∣∣〈Wˆ(j) , V˘(k)〉− δj,k\n∣∣∣2 (18)\nand orthogonality of the RFs to the “numerical” GMs quanti-\nfied by\nOn =\n∑\nj=0,±1\n∑\nk=0,±1\n∣∣∣〈Wˆ(j) , Vˆ(k)〉− δj,k\n∣∣∣2 .\nNote, that by construction the diagonal elements of both the\n“numerical” and “analytical” bi-orthogonality matrices here\nare all equal to 1 up to round-off errors.\nThe measures Oa and On require some discussion. The bi-\northogonality should be exact for exact RFs and GMs. How-\never, what we calculate are approximations of these functions,\nsubject to discretization in ρ and θ and restriction to a finite\ndomain ρ ≤ ρmax. The bi-orthogonality of numerical solu-\ntions is therefore not exact and its deviation from the ideal is\nan indication of the accuracy of calculation, and its conver-\ngence in ∆ρ, ∆θ and ρmax is an indication, albeit indirect, of\nthe accuracy of the solutions.\nIn more detail, if the the matrices representing discretiza-\ntion of L and L+ were transposes of one another, then their\neigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues would be\nexactly orthogonal in l2, and so a measure of their orthog-\nonality would not depend on the spatial discretization but\nonly on the accuracy of the calculation of the eigenvectors by\nARPACK. However, L and L+ are conjugate with respect to\nthe scalar product which is approximated by a discrete inner\nproduct with a weight, hence the matrices of L and L+ are\nnot transposed. Moreover, because of the approximation used\nfor these operators (e.g. high-order approximation in ∆θ vs\nsecond-order approximation in ∆ρ), the corresponding matri-\nces are not adjoint of each other with respect to the weighted\nl2 either. So, On provides a measure of the consistency of\nthese matrix representations together with the accuracy with\nwhich the eigenvectors are computed with ARPACK.\nMoreover, apart from the question of accuracy of finding\nthe eigenvectors of the discretized operators and accuracy of\nfinding the eigenfunctions of the original continuous opera-\ntors, there remains a question of whether the found eigenvec-\ntors and eigenfunctions are the ones that we need, that corre-\nspond to 0 and±iω, rather than eigenfunctions corresponding\nto eigenvalues which happened to be close to 0 and ±iω [49].\nFor the GMs, the answer to this question is ensured by check-\ning the distanceDj ; however, this answer is not absolute as the\ncomparison is made only over part of the disk, for reasons dis-\ncussed above. We note, however, that the L+ eigenfunctions\ncorresponding to the eigenvalues close to but different from\n0,±iω, are orthogonal to the GMs and for them Oa would be\nnot small [50]. Since Oa is defined in terms of scalar products\nwith the mode determined directly from the underlying spiral\nwave, its smallness provides the additional assurance that the\nadjoint eigenfunctions are indeed the RFs that we are after,\nnot just some adjoint eigenfunctions.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. General\nWe have tested our method for computing the response\nfunctions in the case of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, ℓ = 2,\nf1 = ε\n−1(u1 − u\n3\n1/3− u2),\nf2 = ε(u1 − au2 + b),\nD =\n[\n1 0\n0 0\n]\n, with parameters a = 0.5, b = 0.68, ε = 0.3.\nFor pinning, we have used ℓ∗ = 2, u∗ = 0.1 and j∗ = Nρ/2.\nNewton iterations have been performed until the Euclidean\n(l2) norm of the residual in the discretized nonlinear equa-\ntion falls below 10−8. For comparison, we have also run\ncases, discussed later in fig. 5, in which iterations continue\nuntil the norm of the residual no longer decreases (typically\nsuch norms were below 10−9 down to 10−13). The tolerance\nin ARPACK’s routines znaupd and zneupd has been set\nto the default “machine epsilon”. For the Krylov subspace\ndimensionality we have tried 3 and 10, with no perceptible\ndifference in either the numerical results.\nBefore discussing the performance of our numerical tech-\nniques, we briefly present typical solutions. Figures 1 and 2\nillustrate the spiral wave solution and the GMs and RFs for\nρmax = 25, Nρ = 1280 and Nθ = 64. This solution is\ntaken as the best achievable given memory restrictions (4Gb\nof real memory). The angular velocity for it was found to be\nωˆ ≈ 0.5819341748776017. For the GMs and RFs, we show\nthe n = 0 and n = 1 modes only, since the calculated n = −1\nmodes are almost exactly the complex conjugates of the n = 1\nmodes, which of course they should be.\nOne can see that the GMs Vˆ are indeed proportional to cor-\nresponding derivatives of the spiral wave solution Uˆ, and that\nthe RFs Wˆ are localized in a small region of the spiral tip and\nare indistinguishable from zero outside that region.\nThe character of the RFs’ decay with distance is illustrated\nin more detail in fig. 3. We plot the angle-averaged values of\nthe solutions, defined as\n〈X〉\n(n)\ni (ρ) =\n1\n2π\n∮\nXˆ\n(n)\ni (ρ, θ) dθ,\nfor X = U, V and W . Note the difference in the behavior\nof 〈U〉(n)i and 〈V 〉\n(n)\ni on one hand and 〈W 〉\n(n)\ni on the other\nhand. In the semilogarithmic (linear for horizontal axis, log-\narithmic for vertical axis) coordinates of fig. 3(c) the graphs\nof 〈W 〉(n)i (ρ) are straight for a large range of ρ, not too close\nto 0 or ρmax = 25, and for several decades of magnitude of\n〈W 〉\n(n)\ni . This shows clearly the expected exponential localiza-\ntion of the RFs. For comparison, we also show convergence\nof ωˆ = ωˆ(ρmax) in a disk as a function of the disk radius\nρmax. Theory [36, 45–47] predicts that the 〈W 〉(n)i (ρ) and\n∆ω(ρmax) = ωˆ(ρmax)− ωˆ(∞) dependencies should both be\ndecaying exponentials with the same characteristic exponent;\nthis agrees well with the numerical results shown in fig. 3(c).\n6FIG. 1: Solutions of the nonlinear problem (3) and the linearized problem (4,5), i.e. the Goldstone modes, at the “best” parameters, ρmax = 25,\nNρ = 1280, Nθ = 64, as density plots. Numbers under the density plots are their amplitudes A: white of the plot corresponds to the value A\nand black corresponds to the value −A of the designated field. Upper row: 1st components, lower row: 2d components.\nFIG. 2: Same visualization as in fig. 1, for the adjoint linearized problem (13,15), i.e. the response functions.\n7FIG. 3: Radial dependence of the angle-averaged solutions for the spiral wave (a), Goldstone modes (b) and response functions (c). In (c), the\ndependence of ∆ω(ρmax) = ωˆ(ρmax) − ωˆ(25) is shown for comparison, where ωˆ(ρmax) is the numerically found spiral angular velocity in\nthe disk of given radius ρmax.\nSandstede and Scheel [19, 20] have computed exponential\ndecay/increase rates of eigenfunctions of periodic wavetrains\nin one spatial dimension. A similar technique should, in prin-\nciple, also work for the adjoint eigenfunctions. Knowning the\nasymptotic wavelength of the spiral wave, this can be used to\npredict the exponential decay rates of the RFs of spiral waves.\nAs can be seen from the results of Wheeler and Barkley [21],\nalthough such correspondence between 1D and 2D calcula-\ntions can be established, the accuracy of decay rate estimates\nfor two-dimensional eigenfunctions achieved in this way is in-\nsufficient for a meaningful estimate of the accuracy of those\neigenfunctions.\nB. Convergence\nWe now turn to the main results of our study. Convergence\nof the method has been tested by changing one of the three\nnumerical approximation parameters ρmax, Nρ and Nθ while\nkeeping the other two at the fixed values set by the “best ex-\nample”. More specifically, while changing ρmax, we consider\ntwo variants: one with fixed Nθ , and one with changing Nθ\nso that the combination ρmax∆θ, which is the size of the out-\nermost computational cells in the angular direction, remains\nconstant.\nFig. 4 illustrates the results of the study, where the four\ncolumns correspond to different series of calculations, and the\nthree rows correspond to the three different methods of as-\nsessing the accuracy: closeness of the eigenvalues to the theo-\nretical values, distance between “numerical” and “analytical”\nGMs and orthogonality between non-dual RFs and GMs. The\nscales of ∆ρ, ∆θ and the error estimates are logarithmic, and\nthe scales of ρmax are linear. Here shown is the distance be-\ntween the “numerical” and “analytical” Goldstone modes in\nL2 norm, the distance in C0 norm looks similar.\nA typical feature on many of the curves is a “knee”-shape,\nwhen the measure of the error decreases as ρmax grows or ∆θ\nor ∆ρ decrease, but only until a certain point, beyond which\nit reaches a plateau. This behavior is expected and explicable.\nThe calculation error is affected by many factors, and if the\nfactor varied in a particular series becomes negligible, then the\nerror remains at a constant level determined by fixed values of\nother factors.\nThe position of the “knees” on the curves indicates that\nthe accuracy of the rotational (n = 0) modes would be im-\nproved if ∆θ were further decreased (there are no knees on\nthe curves corresponding to the rotational modes, red online,\nin the fourth, i.e. rightmost column), whereas the limiting pa-\nrameter for the translational (n = 1) modes is ∆ρ (there\nare no knees on the curves corresponding to the tanslational\nmodes, blue online, in the third column). The analysis of\nthe first two columns is more complicated. The errors esti-\nmates at the maximal ρmax are similar in both columns as\nthey correspond to the same “best” spiral. These limit val-\nues are achieved, i.e. plateaux are observed, at much smaller\nρmax values if ∆θ = const, than if ρmax∆θ = const. This is\nbecause reduction of ρmax at fixed ∆θ produces an additional\nimprovement of approximation due to the angular discretiza-\ntion. When ρmax∆θ is kept fixed, as in the first column, the\ndependence of the solution on the disk radius is without this\nextra benefit.\nThe rates of convergence with respect to parameters can be\nassessed by the slopes of the curves above the knees before\nthey plateau. In some cases the data is somewhat irregular,\nprimarily at parameters corresponding to lower values of er-\nror estimates. This is not unexpected and we attribute it to in-\ncomplete convergence of the iterative procedures (see below).\nOn the whole, the slopes can be determined clearly from these\nplots.\nThe constant slope in the first (leftmost) and the second\ncolumns corresponds to the exponential convergence with\nρmax. The constant slope in the third column corresponds to\npower-law convergence, and the typical slope is 2. This is\nwell seen on the curves for translational modes, blue online,\nand not well on the curves for rotational modes, red online,\nwhich are very small anyway. Slope 2 in the third column\nis to be expected as our discretization is second-order in ∆ρ\nin all cases. The curves in the fourth (rightmost) column are\nconvex, which is consistent with the fact that the order of ap-\nproximation is Nθ , which varies along the curve as ∆θ varies,\nsince Nθ = 2π/∆θ, so the slope is bigger for smaller ∆θ. In\nother words, the high order of the Fornberg approximation of\nthe θ derivatives implies the convergence in ∆θ is faster than\nany fixed power.\n8FIG. 4: Convergence in numerical parameters: of deviation of the numerical eigenvalues from theoretical (upper row), of L2 distance between\nnumerical and theoretical eigenfunctions (second row) and of orthogonality, i.e. Frobenius norm of the difference of the matrix of scalar\nproducts of eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions from the unity matrix (third row), all in logarithmic scales, as dependencies of disk\nradius (first and second columns, linear scale), radius discretization step (third column, logarithmic scale) and polar angle discretization step\n(fourth column, logarithmic scale). In the first column, ρmax is changed while the values of ∆ρ and R∆θ are kept constant. In the second\ncolumn, ρmax is changed while ∆ρ and ∆θ are kept constant.\nFIG. 5: (a,b) Effect of the accuracy of the unperturbed spiral wave solution on the convergence: (a) Newton-iteration tolerance 10−8. (b)\nNewton iterations until the norm of the residual stopped decreasing. (c) Convergence of the response functions in ∆ρ.\nThe irregular shape of some of the curves in fig. 4 at very\nlow values of the error estimates is related to the accuracy of\nfinding the spiral solution and is ulitmately affected by the\nprecision of floating point computations. Note that all cal-\nculations in fig. 4 have been performed with a tolerance of\n10−8 for Newton iterations of the spiral wave and some of the\ncurves fall as low as 10−15 i.e. close to machine epsilon. A\nchange in the tolerance of the Newton iteration reduces irreg-\nularities in the curves at low values, as shown in fig. 5(a,b).\nFinally, fig. 5(c) illustrates convergence of numerical RFs\n9Wˆ(0,1) as ∆ρ → 0, calculated as the L2-distance E0,1 be-\ntween the solutions at a given resultion ∆ρ and the “best”\nsolution calculated at the smallest ∆ρ∗ = 25/1280. As ex-\nplained in the Sec. II B, this comparsion has been restricted\nto the series of calculations with varying ∆ρ, where grids at\nlower resolutions were subgrids of those with higher resolu-\ntions. The graphs of C0 distances E ′0,1 looked similar and are\nnot shown here.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe main result of this paper is a general, robust method for\nobtaining response functions for rigidly rotating spiral waves\nin excitable media with required accuracy.\nWe have tested the method on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model\nand we have studied the convergence of spiral wave solutions\nand eigenfunctions, both the Goldstone modes and the re-\nsponse functions, with respect to the numerical approximation\nparameters ρmax, Nρ and Nθ . The rates of convergence are\nfound to agree with the order of approximation and indicate\nthe accuracy with which solutions can be found for particular\nnumerical parameters.\nThe slowest (second-order) convergence is, as expected, in\nthe parameterNρ. Thus in a typical situation, an improvement\nof accuracy requires, other things being equal, an increase of\nNρ, with associated increase in memory and time demands.\nThus, the most promising avenue of further development of\nthe method is via increase of the approximation order of the\nradial derivatives. This is, of course, subject to usual caveat\nthat the degree of approximation should be consistent with the\nactual smoothness of the solutions.\nThe method used here to solve the eigenvalue problems for\noperators L relies on successive application of transforma-\ntions of L applied to a sequence of vectors, alternating with\nGram-Schmidt orthogonalization. These are typical ideas,\nalso used in [40, 41]. The difference is that in [40, 41], the lin-\near transformations were polynomial functions of L whereas\nwe use rational functions of L. The polynomial iterations used\nin [40, 41] were in fact equivalent to solving a Cauchy prob-\nlem for equation du/dt = Lu by the explicit Euler method.\nTherefore, those methods require a large number of iterations,\nand convergence speed of the iterations depends on the small-\nness of the absolute difference of the real parts of the eigen-\nvalues of interest compared to those of other eigenvalues. One\nrequires at least O(105) and typically O(106) sparse matrix-\nvector multiplications to achieve the desired solutions to the\neigenvalue problem using such an approach.\nIn contrast, with the complex shift and inversion of L used\nin this paper, the convergence speed of the iterations depends\non the smallness of the distance of the eigenvalues from their\ntheoretical values used in the complex shift, compared to the\ndistance to other eigenvalues. Hence the number of iterations\nrequired is very small, typically O(10). More specifically,\nwith Krylov subspace dimensionality 3, the number of ma-\ntrix multiplications with matrix B of (17) did not exceed 7\nper one eigenpair; with Krylov subspace dimensionality 10,\nthis number rose to 10. The price to pay for this accelera-\ntion is the necessity to solve large systems of linear equations.\nHowever, the key observation is that since the linear system\nis fixed, it needs to be factorized only once, for a given com-\nplex shift, and used for all iterations. Multiplication by ma-\ntrix B is achieved with only inexpensive back/forward solves.\nMoreover, due to the way we ordered the unknowns in the\ndiscretized problem, the sparcity of matrix B does not depend\non the order of approximation of θ-derivatives. Hence, we are\nable to employ high-order approximations requiring far fewer\npoints in the θ direction for the same accuracy as the second-\norder finite difference discretization used in [40], thereby fur-\nther improving the efficiency of our method.\nDiscounting the factorization step, each iteration, which in-\nvolves multiplication by B, is comparable to multiplications\nby L. In practice we find that the factorization itself does\nnot require more than the equivalent of four to six actions of\nB. On a MacPro with 3 GHz Intel processor, the factorization\nstep takes e.g. about 7.5 sec for the gridNρ = 1280,Nθ = 64,\nand 0.67 sec for the grid Nρ = 640, Nθ = 32; the compu-\ntation times per B-multiplication were 1.23 sec and 0.17 sec\nrespectively.\nThe comparison of our present method with [41] is un-\nequivocal: matrix inverses were not used there, and it was\nadmitted already in [41] that the resulting accuracy of solu-\ntions was severely limited. While direct accuracy and timing\ncomparisons with [40] would be most convincing, that code\nis not publicly available. However, for reasons already noted,\non any given polar grid, the method we report is more accu-\nrate due to the angular discretization and considerably faster\nin floating-point operations.\nThe computed response functions are localized in the vicin-\nity of the spiral wave tip and exponentially decay with dis-\ntance from it. This localization ensures convergence of the\nconvolution integral in (12) in an unbounded domain.\nThe eigenvectors of the linearized operator, i.e. Goldstone\nmodes and of its adjoint, i.e. the response functions have been\ncomputed using the same technique, so the qualitatively dif-\nferent behavior of these solutions at large ρ is not a numerical\nartefact, as it was not in any way assumed in the numerical\nmethod.\nAlthough the method has been used here to compute the re-\nsponse functions in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, none of the\ndetails of the method depends on any specifics of the partic-\nular reaction kinetics and should be widely applicable to the\ncomputation of response functions of rigidly rotating waves in\nany other model of excitable tissue, as long as its right-hand\nsides are continuously differentiable so the linarized theory is\napplicable. Moreover, the method can also be extended in a\nstraightforward way to include additional effects, such as the\neffect of uniform twist along scroll waves with linear filaments\nin three dimensions [17, 40, 48].\nAcknowledgement\nThis study has been supported in part by EPSRC grants\nEP/D074789/1 and EP/D074746/1.\n10\n[1] T.

"Current GABAergic sleep-promoting medications were developed pragmatically, without making use of the immense diversity of GABAA receptors. Pharmacogenetic experiments are leading to an understanding of the circuit mechanisms in the hypothalamus by which zolpidem and similar compounds induce sleep at α2βγ2-type GABAA receptors. Drugs acting at more selective receptor types, for example, at receptors containing the α2 and/or α3 subunits expressed in hypothalamic and brain stem areas, could in principle be useful as hypnotics/anxiolytics. A highly promising sleep-promoting drug, gaboxadol, which activates αβδ-type receptors failed in clinical trials. Thus, for the time being, drugs such as zolpidem, which work as positive allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors, continue to be some of the most effective compounds to treat primary insomnia"

INTRODUCTION\nQuantum Computation (QC) [1] poses extreme chal-\nlenges for coherent control of large-scale quantum sys-\ntems. Coping with decoherence and imperfect control\nimplies the use the of error correction codes (QEC)\nand fault tolerant operation. However, maximizing the\nthreshold for arbitrary computation requires the ability\nto perform multiple, simultaneous operations between\nqubits and minimal communication and transport over-\nheads. Incorporating these features in a scalable man-\nner is a major goal for all potential system implementa-\ntions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nA promising candidate for quantum information pro-\ncessing is the ion trap with superb coherence and few\nqubit control having been already demonstrated [7, 8].\nHowever, it is difficult to effectively control more than a\nfew tens of ions in a single trap, hence several ideas have\nbeen proposed to overcome this limitation. Multiple mi-\ncrotraps can be constructed in the same structure with\nions shuttled between them (CCD architecture) [2]. The\nmain disadvantage of a CCD trap is the difficulty in de-\nsigning a micro-trap structure that allows for maximum\nparallelizability for both inter- and intra-logical opera-\ntions. Shuttling heats ions up, requiring additional cool-\ning in the interaction regions and slowing operation. Ad-\nditionally, large numbers of electrodes and lasers would\nbe required in a single device [9].\nAlternatively, ions in separate trap structures may be\nmade to interact via a photonic bus [10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n15, 16]. If used directly to implement two-qubit gates,\nphoton loss from the bus is a major problem and re-\nquires additional QEC overhead [17, 18]. Alternatively,\nthe photonic bus can mediate the generation of entangle-\nment between traps which can then be used to perform\ngates [19] [50].\nThe use of entanglement for intra-computer communi-\ncation is not a new idea. For example, this has been\n∗Electronic address: D.K.L.Oi@damtp.cam.ac.uk\nOptical\nInterface\nIon\nAncilla\nIons\nData\nIons\nOpticalLink\nto Other Traps\nRF Electrodes\nSegmented Electrodes\nControl Lasers\nFIG. 1: An ion trap node. A single ion trap contains enough\nions for a single encoded qubit, ancillas and an interface ion.\nConventional single and two-qubit operations are performed\nvia axial phonon modes of the trap. The interface ion may be\nentangled with its counterpart in another identical trap via\nphoton interference and path erasure. The resultant Bell link\nis used to perform inter-trap operations. The simplest node\nconsists of a single optically coupled ion, five ions encoding\na single logical qubit, and several ancilla for fault tolerant\noperations and singlet purification.\nproposed in CCD ion trap designs where EPR pairs\nare created locally and then the halves sent to entan-\nglement stations distributed among a sea of qubits [3].\nThese entangled pairs would then be used to teleport\nqubits between memory storage and processing regions,\ncircumventing the problem of directly transporting data\nacross the whole computer. However, since the entangled\npairs themselves are created locally and then the separate\nhalves physically moved to where they are required, this\nneccessitates the use of quantum repeaters and extensive\npurification. Furthermore in [3], all 49 qubits of a second\nlevel encoded logical qubit are teleported requiring many\nEPR pairs for transport in both directions.\nIn this paper, we outline an proof-of-concept architec-\nture based around an ion trap processing node containing\na relatively small number of ions representing an encoded\nfirst level error corrected qubit, ancillas for fault-tolerant\n2Multiplexer\nPhotonDetectors\nBeamsplitters\nNode 1 Node 2 Node 3 Node 4\nFIG. 2: Distributed Ion Trap Architecture.

An optical multiplexer allows arbitrary pairs\nof nodes to be entangled, and parallel operation is achieved\nusing multiple beam-splitters and detectors.\noperation, and an interface ion which can be entangled\nwith its counterpart in another node (Fig. 1). An ab-\nstract basis of the scheme was suggested in [19], but\nhere we analyze a concrete realization, taking particu-\nlar attention to the requirements of error correction and\nfault-tolerant operation. In particular, we show how lo-\ncal and non-local logical operations can be reliably per-\nformed directly between two nodes via operator measure-\nments, from which scaling to an arbitrary sized quantum\ncomputer follows. A small prototype is presented which\nis within reach of current experiment.\nThe paper is laid out as follows: The basic architecture\nis covered in Section II, the use of operator measurements\nto implement gates is in Section IIA, the preparation of\nencoded Bell states is in Section IIA 1, fault-tolerant im-\nplementation of non-local operators is in Section IIA 2,\narchitecture scale-up is in Section II B, optimizing node\ndesign is in Section III, and concluding remarks in Sec-\ntion IV.\nII. ARCHITECTURE\nThe basic architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. A net-\nwork of local processing nodes are connected by optical\nfibres and a multiplexing switch. In each trap node is a\nsmall array of ions upon which conventional single and\nintra-trap two-qubit operations can be performed. Pairs\nof nodes can be optically linked to beamsplitters and sin-\ngle photon detectors which entangle the interface qubits\nwhen subjected to appropriate laser excitation and con-\nditioned upon a correct sequence of detector clicks.

The fault-tolerant circuit first requires\nthe preparation and verification of a four qubit GHZ state. If\nthe verification measurement = 1, then the ancilla block is\nreset and prepared again. To protect against Z errors in the\nancilla block, the circuit is repeated up to three times and a\nmajority vote of the syndrome results is taken.\nA. Operation\nWe start off with all qubits initialized. Intra-trap op-\nerations are used to prepare encoded qubits. We assume\nthat each trap can hold a sufficient number of ions to en-\ncode a logical qubit plus an appropriate number of ancilla\nions for error correction in at least the first level of con-\ncatenation. Single qubit, non-trivial, logical operations\n(for example the T gate [20]) are performed with the as-\nsistance of ancilla qubits in the local trap. For inter-node\ntwo-qubit logical operations, instead of directly interact-\ning data qubits via the photonic bus, we instead create\nBell pairs spanning the nodes. By local operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC), two-qubit gates can be\nperformed without risking data loss between nodes.\n1. Inter-node operations and encoded Bell state preparation\nAs an example of inter-node operations, consider the\npreparation of a logically encoded Bell state between\ntwo separate nodes. Each node houses between seven\nand fourteen ions depending on whether fault-tolerant\nerror correction and gate operations are employed. The\ndata ions in each trap will be encoded using the [[5,1,3]]\ncode [21, 22], which is the smallest full quantum code,\nrequiring five ions for a single logically encoded qubit\nprotected from at most one error. The stabiliser struc-\n3ture [23] for the [[5,1,3]] code, Ki i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the\nlogical bit (X¯) and phase (Z¯) operations are specified by,\nK1 = XZZXI, K2 = IXZZX,\nK3 = XIXZZ, K4 = ZXIXZ,\nX¯ = XXXXX, Z¯ = ZZZZZ. (1)\nWhere X and Z are the Pauli σx and σz operators, I is\nthe 2× 2 identity matrix, and the tensor product is im-\nplied. Error correction using stabiliser codes is straight-\nforward [1, 22], each of the four generators Ki are mea-\nsured [Fig. 3(a)] either sequentially using a single ancilla,\nor simultaneously using four ancilla. Each of the sixteen\npossible four-bit results represent one of the correctable\nsingle qubit errors, as well as the case where no error oc-\ncured. At a minimum, fault-tolerant measurement of the\nstabilisers requires a four qubit GHZ state as an ancilla\nblock [Fig. 3(b)]. Additionally, a fifth qubit is used to\nverify the GHZ state against possible X errors which can\nsubsequently propagate to the data block. Therefore the\nminimum number of ions in a single trap needed for log-\nical encoding and correction is six, while a total of ten\nions are needed to employ full fault-tolerant correction\nsequentially.\nThe interaction between logical qubits in separate\nnodes is mediated by interface ions entangled into Bell\npairs by any one of a number of methods [24, 25, 26, 27].\nIt has been shown that some two-qubit gates can be per-\nformed using Bell pairs via LOCC [12, 13, 28, 29]. A\nlarge class of quantum codes, known as Calderbank-Shor-\nSteane (CSS) codes, allow logical controlled-σx (CNOT)\nand controlled-σz (CZ) gates to be applied block-wise be-\ntween two data blocks, which are also inherently fault-\ntolerant. However, the [[5,1,3]] quantum code is not a\nCSS code and block-wise CNOT or CZ gates are not\npossible. This also means that the more rapid method\nof error correction introduced by Steane [30], requiring a\nlarger ancilla block, will not work with the [[5,1,3]] code.\nHowever, a logical CNOT or CZ interaction between two\nlogical blocks of data can be performed for any code that\nallows for block-wise single-qubit bit and/or phase op-\nerations using fewer interface qubits than the standard\nblock-wise approach. This method, first proposed in [31]\nand [32] uses the same basic element as error correction,\nnamely operator measurements.\nA CZ gate between two qubits can be written in terms\nof operators on an arbitrary two qubit state |ψ〉 as,\nCZ|ψ〉 = 1\n2\n(II + ZI + IZ − ZZ)|ψ〉. (2)\nTo achieve this transformation on an arbitrary two-qubit\nstate, we append an ancilla qubit prepared in the state\n|+〉 = (|0〉 + |1〉)/√2, and measure the operators ZIZ\nand IZX over the three qubit system. After these mea-\nsurements, and assuming that the qubits are always pro-\njected to a +1 eigenstate of these operators (otherwise\nlocal corrections can be applied), the final state is given\nby\n1\n2\n(III + ZIZ + IZX + ZZ(X.Z))|ψ〉|+〉. (3)\nSince the Pauli operators X and Z anti-commute and\nthat X |+〉 = |+〉 and Z|+〉 = |−〉, the state can be re-\nwritten as,\n1\n2\n((II + IZ)|ψ〉|+〉+ (ZI − ZZ)|ψ〉|−〉), (4)\nafter which the ancilla is then measured in the computa-\ntional basis. If the measurement result is |0〉, |ψ〉 is pro-\njected to CZ|ψ〉, otherwise it is projected to (IZ).CZ|ψ〉\nupon which a local IZ correction is then applied.\nWe use the above method to perform a logical CZ\nacross two nodes. A single physical Bell state is pre-\npared between two nodes each containing a logical qubit.\nEach half of the Bell state is used as a control qubit on\nthe respective data block of an encoded qubit. For ex-\nample, to measure the logical Z¯Z¯ operator across two\nlogical blocks, local CZ gates are applied between each\nBell pair qubit and the five ions representing the single\nlogical qubit in each node. For a general state of two\nlogical qubits |ψ〉L, the transformation is\n1√\n2\n(|00〉+ |11〉)|ψ〉L → 1√\n2\n(|00〉II + |11〉Z¯Z¯)|ψ〉L, (5)\nwhere Z¯ is as in Eq.1, a logical phase gate for the [[5,1,3]]\ncode. A local Hadamard gate is applied to both interface\nqubits, leading to the state,\n1\n2\n√\n2\n1∑\nj,k=0\n|jk〉(II + (−1)j+kZ¯Z¯)|ψ〉L. (6)\nMeasuring the parity of interface qubits projects the data\nqubits into a ±1 eigenstate of Z¯Z¯ for an even/odd parity\nresult, hence performing the required measurement.\nMeasuring an appropriate sequence of operators will\nenact a logical controlled phase rotation across two nodes.\nTo perform the full CZ gate, an ancilla is needed which\nis finally measured in the computational basis. This an-\ncilla does not need to be a fully encoded logical qubit in\nits own trap, it can just as easily be a single ion con-\ntained in either the control or target trap. However, to\nmaintain fault-tolerance this ancilla qubit should be en-\ncoded. By using operator measurements between traps.\ninter-logical operations can be performed directly on the\n[[5,1,3]] encoded data using only one interface qubit per\ntrap.\nLocalizing a single logical qubit plus appropriate an-\ncilla ions for local error correction has several advantages.\nIntra-trap operations have been demonstrated on up to\neight ions [8] so local operations and error correction\nshould suffer minimal overhead. Probabilistic entangle-\nment generation [24, 25, 26, 27] does not pose a prob-\nlem for inter-node operations as local error correction\n4Non-FT: M\neasure K 1\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 2\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 3\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 4\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 1\nPrepare Bell Link\nRepeat N Times\nRepeat N Times\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nH\nH M\nM\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nCorrection\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 2\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 3\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 4\nCorrection\nEncode\nEncode\nIO\nN\n T\nRA\nP \n#1\nIO\nN\n T\nRA\nP \n#2\nNon-FT: M\neasure K 1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5 5\n5 5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nN\non-FT: Encoded Bell State Preparation\nFIG. 4: Full quantum circuit for non-fault-tolerant, non-local\npreparation of an encoded Bell state across two nodes. Five\nions in each trap are first encoded into the |0〉L state after\nwhich local error correction is repeated continuously (say N\ntimes) to protect against memory errors while the Bell link\nis created. Once the Bell link is created, each interface ion is\nused as a control qubit for a blockwise X gate on each trap.\nThe interface qubits are then measured locally and a classical\nZ¯ gate is applied to the second trap if the measurement result\nhas odd parity. The final state of the two traps is the encoded\nBell state, (|0〉L|0〉L + |1〉L|1〉L)/\n√\n2.\ncan preserve coherence between the generation of entan-\ngled links. This is substantially more advantageous than\nother highly distributed schemes [12] where all ions in-\nteract via these non-local linkages which would be highly\nsusceptible to memory errors while waiting for non-local\nlinks to be established. If required, local control per-\nmits the use of purification protocols in order to increase\ninter-trap gate fidelity [19]. Also, by structuring all inter-\nlogical operations such that they are mediated by entan-\ngled links, larger trap structures, for example the CCD\ndesign of Kielpinski et. al. [2], need only be designed,\nand optimized, for local error correction.\nFrom an experimental standpoint, the preparation of\na logically encoded Bell pair does not require the oper-\nator CZ gate in full. If the initial state is |0〉L|0〉L, the\nmeasurement of the operator X¯X¯ is sufficient to produce\nthe state (|0〉L|0〉L + |1〉L|1〉L)/\n√\n2. Hence experimental\ndemonstration of encoded Bell state preparation does not\nneed the third ancilla qubit required by the operator CZ\ngate.\nWithout maintaining fault-tolerance, we only require\nfive (data block) + one (ancilla) + one (interface) ions per\ntrap to implement the protocol. Fig. 4 shows the com-\nplete quantum circuit required to implement the state\npreparation non-fault-tolerantly, assuming that N full\nlocal error correction cycles are performed in the time\nrequired to prepare the inter-trap Bell link.\n2. Fault-Tolerant encoded state preparation.\nThis general method for preparing a distributed, en-\ncoded Bell state is not fault-tolerant. Utilizing a single\nqubit for correction allows errors to cascade into the data\nblock. Also, the Bell pair interface can induce logical er-\nrors if it is not prepared correctly.\nMaintaining fault-tolerance for local error correction\nis fairly straightforward [1, 33]. The stabilizers for the\n[[5,1,3]] code have a maximum weight of four, hence\nthe ancilla ion used for correction is replaced with five\nions, four of which are prepared in the entangled state\n(|0000〉+|1111〉)/√2, after which the fifth is used to verify\nthe ancilla state against X errors that can propagate to\nthe data block. If verification fails, the ancilla block is re-\nset and re-prepared. Once the state is verified, each of the\nfour ancilla ions are coupled to the data block, with local\nCNOT and Hadamard gates (depending on the stabiliser\nstructure) and measured to determine the syndrome. To\nprotect against Z errors, occurring or propagating to the\nancilla block, the syndrome is measured multiple times.\nAt least two syndrome measurements are made, if they\ndisagree a third syndrome is measured and a majority\nvote taken [Fig. 3(b)]. We adapt this general method to\noperator measurement gates between traps.\nErrors in the Bell link between node, either during\npreparation or during operation, can lead to multiple er-\nrors propagating to the data blocks. For fault-tolerance\nwe again use several ancillas, thereby ensuring that only\none ancilla qubit interacts with one qubit within the\ndata block. Measuring the operator U¯1 ⊗ U¯2, where\nU¯j ∈ {X¯, Z¯}, requires a Bell link between the two nodes\nand the ability to perform CNOT or CZ gates between\neach qubit in the Bell pair and their respective data\nblock. If an X error occurs on the Bell pair then this\ncan propagate to possibly all of the qubits within one of\nthe nodes. If this occurs, the single qubit error will in-\nduce a logical error. To counter this, we introduce several\nmore ancilla qubits into each node and verify the inter-\nface qubit state before coupling ions to the data block.\nThe required circuit needed to prepare a sufficient in-\nterface ancilla for the [[5,1,3]] code is shown in Fig 5.\nWe use two Bell pairs and two additional ancilla qubits\nin each node that are coupled to the original Bell pair\nthrough CNOT gates. After preparation, the ancilla\nblocks of the two nodes are in the state,\n|An〉 = 1\n2\n(|000〉1|000〉2+ |111〉1|111〉2)(|00〉v+ |11〉v) (7)\nThe subscripts 1 and 2 represent the three ancilla qubits\nwithin each node, while the subscript v represents a sec-\nond Bell link between the two nodes used for ancilla ver-\nification. Now a CNOT gate is performed between the\nlast qubit in each node and the verification Bell state. If\nno errors have occurred then the CNOT operations will\nleave the verification Bell pair invariant. Considering all\nthe possible single X error locations during the prepa-\nration of the ancilla state we find the following unique\n5X\nX\nX\nX\nPrepare \nBell State\nPrepare \nBell State\nX\nX\nM\nM\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nRepeat for odd parity measurement.\nIO\nN\n T\nRA\nP \n#1\nIO\nN\n T\nRA\nP \n#2\nFIG. 5: Circuit to prepare and verify the interface ancilla\nblocks for fault-tolerant operator measurement on the [[5,1,3]]\ncode. The ancilla state requires the preparation of two Bell\nlinks between the separate data traps. After the local CNOT\ngates the second Bell link is measured. If the measurement\nresult has odd parity, the interface block is reset and re-\nprepared. Local error correction can be performed on each\ndata block while waiting for a verified interface ancilla block.\nstates are possible.\n|An〉 = 1\n2\n(|000〉1|000〉2 + |111〉1|111〉2)(|01〉v + |10〉v),\n|An〉 = 1\n2\n(|000〉1|111〉2 + |111〉1|000〉2)(|01〉v + |10〉v),\n|An〉 = 1\n2\n(|000〉i|011〉j + |111〉i|100〉j)(|01〉v + |10〉v),\n|An〉 = 1\n2\n(|000〉i|001〉j + |111〉i|110〉j)(|01〉v + |10〉v),\n(8)\nWhere [i, j] ∈ {[1, 2], [2, 1]}. The verification qubits are\nmeasured in the computational basis and if an even par-\nity result is obtained, then the ancilla state is verified,\notherwise either the ancilla or verification qubits have\nexperienced a single X error and we repeat the prepara-\ntion.\nThe inclusion of the second Bell link between two nodes\nand the additional ancillas allows the verification of the\nancilla state prior to coupling it to the data qubits, pro-\ntecting the ancilla state from a single X error. Phase\nerrors in the ancilla block result in an incorrect deter-\nmination regarding which eigenstate the data qubits are\nprojected to. To protect against this, the operator is\nmeasured two to three times and a majority vote taken.\nAt each stage, error correction can be continuously per-\nformed on each data block while the interface ancilla\nblock is prepared and verified.\nIn Section IIA 1 we showed how the Bell link can al-\nlow the measurement of a given Hermitian operator. This\nrequired performing a controlled operation from the Bell\nlink qubits to each of the data qubits. For the [[5,1,3]]\ncode, this allows for a logical X¯ and/or Z¯ operator mea-\nsurement since these logical operations can be performed\nblock-wise. To maintain Fault-Tolerance, this would re-\nquire five ancilla qubits in each node connected to the\nBell pair. However we can reduce this to three in each\nnode by exploiting the stabiliser structure of the [[5,1,3]]\ncode.\nAny given logical state |ψ〉L encoded with the [[5,1,3]]\ncode is stabilised by the operators K1 to K4. Therefore\n|ψ〉L = Ki|ψ〉L, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. If a logical Z¯ (X¯) op-\neration is performed on the state, it is not necessary to\napply five single qubit Z (X) gates, but we can redefine\nthe logical operators in terms of the stabilisers. Consider\nthe first stabiliser K1 = XZZXI. Then,\nZ¯|ψ〉L = Z¯K1|ψ〉L = (X.Z)II(X.Z)Z|ψ〉 (9)\ntherfore only three operators, hence four ancilla qubits,\nare required for the interface block, instead of five.\nThe total number of ions in each trap for full fault-\ntolerant local correction and coupling between the traps\nis fourteen. Five ancilla ions are needed for local fault-\ntolerant error correction of the five ion logical qubits,\nwhile four ions are needed as the interface ancilla block\nincluding two non-local Bell links, one to actually link\nthe traps and one to verify the ancilla block. The total\nnumber of qubits needed for this scheme and the num-\nber of non-local Bell links for a general quantum code is\nsignificantly less depending on the size of the code used.\nFor a general, CSS, n qubit code correcting a single error,\nand assuming that no purification protocols are used, n\nBell links are required to perform a block-wise CZ gate\nin one time step. In contrast, this scheme only requires\ntwo Bell links (regardless of the code size) to perform a\nCZ gate in several time steps. In between each step, lo-\ncal error correction can be performed to protect against\nmemory errors.\nB. Extending the scheme to larger architectures\nThe above scheme of preparing a non-local encoded\nBell state between two separate nodes can easily be ex-\ntended to a much larger distributed system. Each node\nwould be designed to house a single logical qubit, or sev-\neral logical qubits for a general [[n,k,d]] code with k > 1.\nIf multiple concatenation levels are warranted, then the\nnode system would also have the requisite number of\nqubits and routing system to allow full Fault-Tolerant er-\nror correction at all levels. The inter-logical operations,\nat the highest level of encoding are then performed using\nthe non-local Bell links and the operator measurement\nprotocol. For a multiply concatenated (mth) level qubit,\nthe operator measurement formalism can be extended in\na straightforward manner.\nFor all CSS codes, block-wise Z and X operations are\npossible. Hence to measure these operators across two\n6nodes at the mth level of encoding, a CZ or CNOT gate\nis performed between each half of a Bell link pair of qubits\nand all of the physical qubits in the two separately en-\ncoded nodes. Fault-tolerance would require a similar an-\ncilla system as that used in the [[5,1,3]] example. Instead\nof using two Bell links and four ancilla qubits per trap,\nthe total number of ancillas will be equal to\nNumber of Ancilla = Wt(U¯)m + 1, (10)\nwhere m is the concatenation level and Wt(U¯) is the\nminimum weight of the n qubit operation that invokes a\nblockwise logical U operation on the kth qubit (if multiple\nqubits are encoded within a single node). The number\nof Bell links required between nodes remains constant at\ntwo, unless a quantum code is employed that encodes\nmultiple logical qubits. In this case inter-logical oper-\nations between states located in different nodes will re-\nquire two Bell links for each pair of qubit interactions\nbetween nodes. Figure 6 shows an example structure\nfor a distributed computer using the CCD trap design.\nEach CCD chip is designed exclusively for a single log-\nical qubit encoded with the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. Each\nchip houses seven data qubits, an additional 28 ancilla\nqubits which would allow for the simultaneous prepara-\ntion and verification of two separate ancilla blocks using\nthe rapid method of Steane [30], and the four interface\nqubits which are required for fault-tolerant operator mea-\nsurements using the Steane code. Each chip is manufac-\ntured and characterized separately and would be plugged\nin to the optical multiplexer, linking it to the rest of the\ncomputer.\nWithin a larger architecture, the logical qubits needed\nfor a given quantum algorithm are interspersed with log-\nically encoded ancilla traps that are then used to per-\nform logical CZ gates using the methods described in\nSection IIA 1.\nIII. NODE DESIGN\nTo summarize the architecture, each node should sat-\nisfy the key requirements:\n• A sufficient number of long lived physical qubits for\nan error corrected logical qubit.\n• An additional number of ancilla qubits for error\ncorrection and operator measurements. Measure-\nment of these ancilla should be fast and reliable.\nThe absolute coherence time of these ancilla may\nbe traded against fast operations.\n• A qubit which can be entangled with its counter-\npart in another node. This process can be proba-\nbilistic but heralded.\n• Fast and reliable single and two-qubit operations\nwithin the node for single logical qubit operations,\nerror correction, operator measurements, and en-\ntanglement purification.\nOpticalMultiplexer\nSingle Level [[7,1,3]]\nQCCD Logical Qubit\n2 Ancilla Blocks\nInterface Ions\nData Ions\nQEC\nAncilla\nIons\nLogical Qubit Node\nAncilla\nVerification\nIons\nSingle Level [[7,1,3]]\nQCCD Logical Qubit\n2 Ancilla Blocks\nSingle Level [[7,1,3]]\nQCCD Logical Qubit\n2 Ancilla Blocks\nSingle Level [[7,1,3]]\nQCCD Logical Qubit\n2 Ancilla Blocks\nFIG. 6: CCD micro-trap structure for a single logical qubit\nusing the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. Each chip houses 39 ions: 7\ndata ions, 28 ancilla ions (allowing for simultaneous prepa-\nration and verification of two ancilla blocks using Steane’s\nrapid correction method [30]) and 4 interface ions for coupling\nto other logical qubits. The interface state required for the\n[[7,1,3]] code is identical to the [[5,1,3]] code since each of the\nseven dimensional stabilizers for the Steane code has weight\nfour, hence Wt(Z¯) = Wt(X¯) = 3. Each of these chip nodes\ncan then be connected to the optical multiplexer, increasing\nthe total size of the quantum computer as needed.\nIf multiple Bell links are required with a single node, the\nstate of the interface qubit can be swapped to an ancilla\nand the interface qubit re-entangled. Of course, multi-\nple interface qubits would allow for parallel entangling\noperations but are not strictly necessary. Entanglement\npurification may be required to increase the fidelity of\nthe entangled links between traps. Nested entanglement\npumping [36] reduces the number of ancilla required for\nhigh fidelity Bell pairs.\nSegmentation of a linear trap could be used to isolate\nthe interface ion from the rest of the trap until required.\nBy suitable geometry, the interface region would not im-\npinge on intra-trap operation, either by phonon coupling\nor photon scattering. When entanglement is needed, the\ntrap potentials are rearranged so that an ancilla ion could\nbe placed into a common mode with the interface ion and\nquantum state transfer performed, afterwards which the\nancilla would be brought back to the rest of the ions for\nfurther processing.\nThough we have primarily considered a linear Paul\ntrap as a node, one could replace it with any other small\n7qubit system as long as the above requirements are met,\ne.g. a CCD trap with an optical interface region as in Sec-\ntion II B. The Penning trap [37] has also been suggested\nas a candidate for quantum computation, with hundreds\nor thousands of ions in a single two-dimensional Coulomb\ncrystal [38, 39] and two-qubit gates via transverse phonon\nmodes [40]. The large number of physical qubits would\nallow larger code words protecting against multiple errors\nand/or optimised for different error models. However,\nthe rotation of the crystal would complicate ion address-\ning [51] and would restrict strong cavity coupling to the\ncentral ion [52].\nWithin each node, the physical qubits play different\nroles opening up the possibility of optimization of their\nseparate properties. The data qubits require long coher-\nence times, whilst we may want to optimise the ancilla\nqubits for fast operations and measurement. The inter-\nface qubit should have suitable optical properties for the\nentanglement generation procedure. In a Paul ion trap,\ndifferent ionic species could be utilized and loaded in or-\nder by frequency selective ionization [43]. The use of\nheavier ions (such as Cd+) for data storage may reduce\ngate errors due to spontaneous decay from intermediate\nmetastable states [42], or else direct microwave driving\nof hyperfine transitions could eliminate this entirely [44].\nLighter ions could be used as ancilla in order to lower the\nmass of the ion string and hence raise the axial phonon\nfrequencies aiding cooling and two-qubit gate times.\nTo reduce the number of ions in each node, the use\nof multiple levels in the ground hyperfine manifold to\nencode multiple qubits could be considered [45]. Since\nmeasurement is likely to distinguish the state of all the\nencoded qubits of an ion, this method may not be suitable\nfor data qubits, but is not necessarily a drawback for\nuse for ancilla qubits which en bloc are measured and\ninitialized repeatedly.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have proposed the use of entanglement to di-\nrectly implement non-local operations between sepa-\nrately housed logical qubits. These ideas may also be ap-\nplicable to other physical quantum computing implemen-\ntations which satisify the requirements in Section III [53].\nThe entanglement is created by a point-to-point process\nwhich reduces routing difficulties and enables parallel op-\neration. Logical operations via operator measurements\nrequire minimal entangled resources compared to a di-\nrectly teleported sequence of block-wise gates but still\nretains fault tolerance. By keeping data local to a sin-\ngle node, the node can be of comparatively simple de-\nsign and size, optimized for local high fidelity operations.\nThe technique should be able to be generalized to multi-\nqubit operations utilizing multi-partite entangled states\nand may serve as the basis for a full scalable quantum\ncomputing architecture. A proof of principle demonstra-\ntion with two traps containing seven or eight ions and\nan optical interface each is within the reach of current\nexperiment [8, 11]. Even simpler to demonstrate are op-\nerator measurement gates, the optical interface could be\nomitted and a gate performed between two three-qubit\nencoded (single X or Z-error) logical qubits coupled via\na single Bell pair. Such a distributed architecture is a\nstrong alternative to monolithic designs.\nAcknowledgments\nDKLO acknowledges the support of the Cambridge-\nMIT Institute Quantum Information Initiative, EU\ngrants RESQ (IST-2001-37559) and TOPQIP (IST-2001-\n39215), EPSRC QIP IRC (UK), and Sidney Sussex Col-\nlege, Cambridge.

The strategies are detailed in \nthe CDC’s Community Guide for Promoting Physi-\ncal Activity (http://www.thecommunityguide.org/pa/ \nindex.html) and include access to places for physical \nactivity, an individual health-behavior change pro-\ngram, social support, a community-wide campaign, \nand point-of-decision prompts. \nOver 300 people were invited to take the survey; \namong those eligible 58% completed the survey. The \ninterviewees that participated were interested in learn-\ning more about the study, and were eager to provide \ninput about physical activity in Cuba and in their lives. After the data are \nanalyzed, the results will be provided to the community, to other profes-\nsionals, and to other communities interested in the project. We hope to \nsee an increase in the amount of walking and other physical activity in the \nVillage over time, and also on the various trails that have been established \nwithin and around the community. \nThe PRC is excited to be working collaboratively with the community-\nbased Step into Cuba program on this project and is looking forward \nto our continued partnership. We appreciate all of the organizations \nand businesses who allowed VIVA staff to set up on their property to \nconduct the surveys including the Village of Cuba, Mickey’s Saveway, \nSubway, El Bruno’s, and the Nacimiento Community Foundation.

STAND UP FOR YOUR HEALTH! \nBy Sarah Sanders, MA and Mary Hanrahan, BFA \nThese days “standing desks” are \nbecoming a popular trend in places \nlike the Pentagon and Silicon \nValley, but the shift to standing \nat work is historically much older \nthan you might think. The frst \nreports of standing desks were in \n19th century industrial and state \nlegislature journals. Standing desks \nwere popular at the time in offces, \nbanks, architectural frms, and \nnewspapers and instead of indi-\nvidual desks there were communal \nareas where employees would stand \nor lean with stools over banks of \nlarge communal tables. In 1889, \nDr. Ludwig Wilhelm Johannes \nKotelmann describes in his book, \n‘School Hygiene,’ the importance of\nstanding desks: “too much sitting is liable to injure the abdomi-\nnal organs and the circulation,” he states. The most popular use\nof standing desks by famous people throughout history were:\nThomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill and\nEarnest Hemingway to name a few. What is old is now new\nagain and today schools and businesses are experimenting with\ngiving their students and employees adjustable height desks that\nallow them the options to stand or sit.\n   For many of us, “working” means sitting in front of a comput-\ner for eight hours a day, fve days a week (or more). Add to that\ndriving to and from work, sitting for meals, relaxing in front of\nthe television or with a book, and suddenly you realize that most\nof your awake time is spent sitting, or rather, in the most recent\njargon, you spend most of the day being sedentary. Even if you\nexercise religiously for 1 or even 2 hours each day, you may still\nbe considered a “couch potato” given the total amount of time\nthat you sit, because the amount of time that you spend being\nsedentary affects your health.\n Sitting for long periods brings health risks which are separate\nfrom the risks attributed to not exercising. Recent studies have\nshown that sitting for 6 hours or more each day has serious\ndeleterious health effects.\nSITTING TOO MUCH CAN:\n•\t increase \tyour \trisk \tof \tdiabetes, \theart \tdisease \tand \tobesity \t\t\n•\t shorten \tyour \tlife \t\n•\t negatively \timpact \twaist \tcircumference, \tblood \tsugar, \tand \t \n cholesterol \n All of these health risks are increased if you are female or  \noverweight. \n In addition to long-term health effects, sitting for too long can\nlead to multiple acute discomforts such as low back pain, and\nswelling, tingling or numbness of the lower legs or feet caused\nby restricted blood fow. Are you ready to jump out of your chair\nyet? When you do, remember to change position frequently.\nIn addition to low back pain and restricted blood fow, those\nwho stand for extended amounts of time complain of foot and leg\npain, bunions, corns, heel spurs, plantar fasciitis, Achilles ten-\ndonitis, and varicose veins. Prolonged standing is not encouraged\nany more than prolonged sitting. The idea is having the\noption to stand, which provides and encourages change of posi-\ntion throughout the work day. The benefts of incorporating\nmore standing during the day are numerous. Standing more dur-\ning the day can have the following positive health effects:\n•\t increased metabolism and calorie burning \n•\t increased blood flow \n•\t improved muscle tone \n•\t increased energy and concentration \n•\t improved posture \nIf you’re interested in burning extra calories, a standing desk can help \nyou burn about 150 to 200 extra calories over a sitting one. Check out \nwww.juststand.org and use their calculator to see how many calories you \ncan burn in a day of standing. \nTo learn more about getting started, better posture, desk modifications \noptions, ergonomics, and a list of vendors view the PowerPoint present-\ned by Sarah Sanders and Mary Hanrahan at: http://hsc.unm.edu/som/ \nprc/_images/pdfs/standing%20desks_history.pdf \nPhotos: Top left: Exercise Scientist, Sarah Sanders\nBottom left: Commmunications Coordinator, Mary Hanrahan \nThe Connection - WINTER - 2011                                                                                     UNM Prevention Research Center\nVisit us at http://hsc.unm.edu/som/prc/   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n7 \nWALK AND ROLL TO SCHOOL DAY 2011 \nBy Leona Woelk, MA \nWalk and Roll to School Day \nPh\not\no \ncr\ned\nit\n: D\nor\not\nhy\n L\nan\ne \nw\neb\nsi\nte\n \nPh\not\no \ncr\ned\nit\n: C\nor\nne\nll \nM\nag\nda\nle\nna\nBy Patricia Keane, MS, RD, LD \nSavory Roasted Root\nVegetables \nServes 4 | Prep time: 10 minutes | Cook time: 35 minutes \n1 whole pumpkin, sliced, peeled and cut into chunks \n6 fngerling potatoes, unpeeled, cut into chunks \n2 small yellow onions, cut into wedges \n2 fennel bulbs, sliced \nHead Start students at the Pueblo \nde Jemez on WRTSD \n(WRTSD) is New Mexico’s \nversion of International Walk \nto School Day.

Sixty-nine schools from across the state \nand around 10,000 students participated. Each school decides \nhow to celebrate WRTSD, but typical events include WRTSD \nparades, school assemblies, pedestrian safety classes, bicycle \nrodeos, poster contests, Walking School Buses, Bicycle Trains, \nWRTSD proclamations, guest speakers and local media cover-\nage.

"In this paper, we study the major modules of on-line handwritten chemical expressions recognition. We propose a novel two-level algorithm to recognize expressions. In the first level, structural information is used to distinguish different parts and recognize substances. Then the algorithm segments expressions fatherly and recognizes isolated symbols. To meet the demand of actual applications, the paper also designs an XML-based system to help users save, modify and search the recognition result. The experiment shows that the presented algorithm is reliable. 1"

Conlon and Lee\nconjectured that if k is even, then the (k−1)-subdivision of any multigraph has extremal\nnumber O(n1+\n1\nk ), and moreover, that for any simple graph F there exists ε > 0 such\nthat the (k − 1)-subdivision of F has extremal number O(n1+\n1\nk\n−ε). In this paper, we\nprove both conjectures.\n1 Introduction\nFor a multigraph F , a subdivision of F is a graph obtained by replacing the edges of F with\npairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of arbitrary lengths. The k-subdivision of F is the\ngraph obtained by replacing the edges of F with pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of\nlength k + 1, and is denoted by F k.\nMany researchers have studied the problem of estimating the number of edges needed in\na graph G on n vertices to guarantee that it contains as a subgraph a subdivided copy of a\nfixed graph. The first result in this direction is due to Mader [12] who proved that for any\ngraph F there exists a constant cF = c such that if an n-vertex graph G contains at least\ncn edges, then G contains a subdivision of F as a subgraph. In this result the size of the\nsubdivided graph can grow with n, which is necessary since an n-vertex graph with cn edges\nneed not contain a cycle of bounded length.\nAnswering a question of Erdo˝s about planar subgraphs [5], Kostochka and Pyber [11]\nproved that any n-vertex graph with at least 4t\n2\nn1+ε edges contains a subdivided Kt with\nat most 7t\n2 log t\nε vertices. This is the first result that guarantees a subdivided Kt of bounded\nsize.\nFor a family F of graphs, we let ex(n,F) be the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex\ngraph not containing any F ∈ F as a subgraph. When F = {F}, we write ex(n, F ) for the\nsame function.\nLet Ft,k be the family of graphs that can be obtained by replacing the edges of Kt with\npairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length at most k. Jiang [9] proved that for any\nt ∈ N and any 0 < ε < 1/2, we have ex(n,Ft,⌈10/ε⌉) = O(n\n1+ε). Here the asymptotic notation\nmeans that n → ∞ and other parameters are constant. We follow the same convention\nthroughout the paper.\nNote that Jiang’s result improves that of Kostochka and Pyber in two ways. Firstly, any\nF ∈ Ft,⌈10/ε⌉ has at most\nct2\nε vertices, so a log factor is saved. Secondly, the edges in Jiang’s\ntheorem are replaced by uniformly short paths not depending on t. However, they can still\nhave different lengths. The next result of Jiang and Seiver guarantees a subdivided Kt with\nprescribed path lengths.\nTheorem 1.1 (Jiang–Seiver [10]). For any t ∈ N and any even k ∈ N,\nex(n,Kk−1t ) = O(n\n1+ 16\nk ).\n∗Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge, United King-\ndom. E-mail: oj224@cam.ac.uk.\n1\nNote that if k is odd, then Kk−1t is not a bipartite graph, so ex(n,K\nk−1\nt ) = Θ(n\n2).\nConlon and Lee conjectured that the following two strengthenings hold.\nConjecture 1.2 (Conlon–Lee [4]). Let F be a multigraph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Then\nex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+\n1\nk ).\nConjecture 1.3 (Conlon–Lee [4]). Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Then\nthere exists some ε > 0 such that\nex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+\n1\nk\n−ε).\nIn the case k = 2, Conjecture 1.2 follows from the r = 2 case of a result of Fu¨redi [7] and\nAlon, Krivelevich and Sudakov [1], which states that any bipartite graph with maximum de-\ngree at most r on one side has extremal number O(n2−1/r). The k = 2 case of Conjecture 1.3\nwas proved by Conlon and Lee [4], and improved bounds were given by the author [8].\nVery recently, Conlon, Janzer and Lee proved Conjecture 1.3 for every bipartite graph F .\nTheorem 1.4 (Conlon–Janzer–Lee [3]). Let F be a simple bipartite graph and let k ≥ 1.\nThen there exists some ε > 0 such that\nex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+\n1\nk\n−ε).\nAs a simple corollary, they significantly improved the bound in Theorem 1.1.\nTheorem 1.5 (Conlon–Janzer–Lee [3]). Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 2 be even.\nThen there exists some ε > 0 such that\nex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+\n2\nk\n−ε).\nIn this paper, we prove both Conjecture 1.2 and Conjecture 1.3.\nTheorem 1.6. Let F be a multigraph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Then\nex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+\n1\nk ).\nTheorem 1.7. Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Then there exists some ε > 0\nsuch that\nex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+\n1\nk\n−ε).\nNote that these results are tight. Indeed, by a result of Conlon [2], the Theta graph\nθk,ℓ has extremal number Θ(n\n1+1/k) for all ℓ ≥ ℓ0(k), showing that Theorem 1.6 is tight.\nMoreover, Erdo˝s-Re´nyi random graphs show that ex(n,Kk−1t ) = Ω(n\n1+1/k−ck,t) where ck,t →\n0 as t→∞, so Theorem 1.7 is also tight.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some of the\nkey definitions and give the high-level structure of the proof, with the key technical lemmas\ndeferred to Sections 3 and 4.\n2\n2 The high-level structure of the proof\nA graph G is called K-almost-regular if maxv∈V (G) d(v) ≤ Kminv∈V (G) d(v), where d(v) is\nthe degree of vertex v. The following lemma, which is a small modification of a result proved\nby Erdo˝s and Simonovits [6], allows us to restrict our attention to almost regular host graphs.\nLemma 2.1 (Jiang–Seiver [10]). Let ε, c be positive reals, where ε < 1 and c ≥ 1. Let n be\na positive integer that is sufficiently large as a function of ε. Let G be a graph on n vertices\nwith e(G) ≥ cn1+ε. Then G contains a K-almost-regular subgraph G′ on m ≥ n\nε−ε2\n2+2ε vertices\nsuch that e(G′) ≥ 2c5 m\n1+ε and K = 20 · 2\n1\nε2\n+1.\nUsing this lemma, Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.7 reduce to the following two statements,\nrespectively. For notational convenience, we have dropped the assumption that k is even,\nand replaced k by 2k.\nTheorem 2.2. Let F be a multigraph and let k ≥ 1. Suppose that G is a K-almost-regular\ngraph on n vertices with minimum degree δ = ω(n\n1\n2k ). Then, for n sufficiently large, G\ncontains a copy of F 2k−1.\nTheorem 2.3. Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 1. Then there exists ε > 0 with the\nfollowing property. Suppose that G is a K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum\ndegree δ = ω(n\n1\n2k\n−ε). Then, for n sufficiently large, G contains a copy of F 2k−1.\nFrom now on we let F be an arbitrary fixed multigraph and write H = F 2k−1. Moreover,\nthroughout the paper we tacitly assume that n is sufficiently large.\nThe next definition was introduced in [3], and was used to prove Theorem 1.4.\nDefinition 2.4. Let L be a positive real and let f(ℓ, L) = L5\nℓ\nfor 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k. We recursively\ndefine the notions of L-admissible and L-good paths of length ℓ in a graph. Any path of\nlength 1 is both L-admissible and L-good. For 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k, we say a path P = v0v1 . . . vℓ\nis L-admissible if every proper subpath of P is L-good, i.e., vivi+1 . . . vj is L-good for every\n(i, j) 6= (0, ℓ). The path P is L-good if it is L-admissible and the number of L-admissible\npaths of length ℓ between v0 and vℓ is at most f(ℓ, L).\nThe next lemma will be used several times later.\nLemma 2.5. Let ℓ ≥ 2 and let L > ℓ. If a path P = v0 . . . vℓ is L-admissible, but not L-good,\nthen there exist at least L pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length ℓ from v0 to vℓ.\nProof. Take a maximal set of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length ℓ from\nv0 to vℓ and assume that it consists of fewer than L paths. These paths contain at most\nL(ℓ − 1) internal vertices in total and any path of length ℓ between v0 and vℓ intersects\nat least one of these vertices. Since there are at least L5\nℓ\nL-admissible paths of length ℓ\nbetween v0 and vℓ, it follows by pigeon hole that there exist some 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ − 1 and some\nx ∈ V (G) such that there are at least L\n5ℓ\n(ℓ−1)L(ℓ−1) L-admissible paths of the form u0u1 . . . uℓ\nwith u0 = v0, ui = x, uℓ = vℓ. Observe that\nL5\nℓ\n(ℓ−1)L(ℓ−1) > L\n5iL5\nℓ−i\n, so either there are more\nthan L5\ni\nL-good paths of length i between v0 and x or there are more than L\n5ℓ−i L-good\npaths of length ℓ − i between x and vℓ. In either case, we contradict the definition of an\nL-good path.\nOur strategy will be to prove that, roughly speaking, in any almost regular H-free graph\nthere are many good paths of length 2k. As we will see in Section 3, the techniques in [3]\ncan be easily applied to prove this for paths of length k. The novelty of this paper is the\nmachinery that allows us to extend this to longer paths, using very different techniques. This\nis given in Section 4, where we prove the following lemma.\n3\nLemma 2.6. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum de-\ngree δ ≥ L100\nk |V (H)|, and let S ⊂ V (G). Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared\nto |V (H)| and K, |S| = ω( n\nδ1/2\n) and |S| = ω( n\nL1/2\n), the number of L-good paths of length 2k\nwith both endpoints in S is Ω( |S|\n2δ2k\nn ).\nNote that in this result and everywhere else in the paper, the asymptotic notation Ω allows\nthe implied constant to depend on k, |V (H)| and K, which are thought of as constants, while\nδ and L are functions of n.\nWith Lemma 2.6 in hand, the proof of Theorem 2.2 is immediate.\nProof of Theorem 2.2. Suppose that G does not contain H = F 2k−1 as a subgraph. Since\nδ = ω(n\n1\n2k ), we may choose L with L = ω(1), L100\nk |V (H)| ≤ δ and n2f(2k, L) = o(nδ2k).\nThen we may apply Lemma 2.6 with S = V (G) to get that the number of L-good paths\nof length 2k in G is Ω(nδ2k), which is ω(n2f(2k, L)). However, by the definition of L-\ngoodness, between any two vertices there can be at most f(2k, L) such paths, which is a\ncontradiction.\nThe proof of Theorem 2.3 is slightly more complicated, and it uses ideas from [8].\nProof of Theorem 2.3. Firstly note that F is a subgraph of Kt for some t, so it suffices\nto prove the result for F = Kt. Let ε > 0 be sufficiently small, to be specified, and let G be\na K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum degree δ = ω(n\n1\n2k\n−ε). Assume that\nG does not contain a copy of H = F 2k−1.\nFor vertices u, v ∈ V (G), let us write u ∼ v if there is a path of length 2k between u\nand v. Also, let us say that u and v are distant if for every 1 ≤ i ≤ 4k − 2, the number\nof walks of length i between u and v is at most δi−2k+1/2. Observe that for any u ∈ V (G)\nthe number of walks of length i starting from u is at most (Kδ)i, so the number of vertices\nv ∈ V (G) for which there are at least δi−2k+1/2 walks of length i from u to v is at most\n(Kδ)i\nδi−2k+1/2\n= Kiδ2k−1/2. Thus, the number of v ∈ V (G) for which u and v are not distant is\nO(δ2k−1/2).\nDefine c0 = ε and cℓ+1 = (3 · 5\n2k + 1)cℓ + 2kε for 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t− 1. Assume that ε is small\nenough so that\n3 · 100k|V (H)| · cℓ ≤\n1\n2k\n− ε (1)\nfor all 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t. Then in particular cℓ ≤\n1\n4k − ε/2 holds for all 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t. For future\nreference, note that then\nncℓ ≤ n\n1\n4k\n−ε/2 = o(δ1/2). (2)\nClaim. For any 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t, there exist distinct vertices x1, . . . , xℓ ∈ V (G) and a set Sℓ ⊂ V (G)\nsuch that\n(i) there is a copy of K2k−1ℓ in G with the vertices of the subdivided Kℓ being x1, . . . , xℓ\n(ii) xi ∼ y for every 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ and every y ∈ Sℓ\n(iii) |Sℓ| = Ω(n\n1−cℓ) and\n(iv) xi and xj are distant for every 1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ.\nNote that in particular for ℓ = t, condition (i) guarantees the existence of a subgraph\nK2k−1t , so it suffices to prove the claim.\nProof of Claim. We proceed by induction on ℓ. For ℓ = 0, we may take S0 = V (G). Assume\nnow that we have verified the claim for ℓ.\n4\nSuppose that for some y ∈ Sℓ there exist 1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ and two paths of length 2k, one\n(called Pi) from xi to y and one (called Pj) from xj to y, which share a vertex other than y.\nLet they intersect at some vertex z 6= y. Now let the subpath of Pi between xi and z have\nlength α and let the subpath of Pj between xj and z have length β. Then there is a walk of\nlength α+ β from xi to xj through z. Moreover, there is a path of length 2k − α from z to\ny. Observe that 2k − α ≤ 4k − (α+ β)− 1.\nLet Y be the set of y ∈ Sℓ for which there exist some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ and a walk W of\nlength γ ≤ 4k − 2 between xi and xj such that for some vertex w on W the distance of y\nfrom w is at most 4k− γ− 1. By condition (iv), there are at most δγ−2k+1/2 walks of length\nγ between any xi and xj so there are O(δ\nγ−2k+1/2) vertices appearing in at least one of these\nwalks. Therefore the number of vertices at distance at most 4k − γ − 1 from at least one of\nthese vertices is O(δγ−2k+1/2 · δ4k−γ−1) = O(δ2k−1/2). That is, |Y | = O(δ2k−1/2).\nNotice that by the discussion above, for any y ∈ Sℓ \\ Y and any i 6= j, a path of length\n2k from xi to y, and a path of length 2k from xj to y have no common vertex other than\ny. Thus, by condition (ii) there exist ℓ paths of length 2k, one from each xi to y which are\npairwise vertex-disjoint apart from at y. Moreover, these paths are also vertex-disjoint from\nthe paths forming the K2k−1ℓ guaranteed by condition (i), apart from the trivial intersections\nat x1, . . . , xℓ (else, there is a path of length at most 2k − 1 from y to a point on a path of\nlength 2k between some xi and xj , which contradicts the fact that y 6∈ Y ). Thus, for any\ny ∈ Sℓ \\ Y there is a copy of K\n2k−1\nℓ+1 in G with the vertices of the subdivided Kℓ+1 being\nx1, . . . , xℓ, y.\nLet Z be the set of z ∈ Sℓ which are not distant to xi for at least one 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ. By the\nsecond paragraph in this proof, |Z| = O(δ2k−1/2).\nLet S′ℓ = Sℓ \\ (Y ∪ Z). Recall that |Y | = O(δ\n2k−1/2). Note that if δ = ω(n\n1\n2k ), then,\nby Theorem 2.2, G contains H as a subgraph, so we may assume that δ = O(n\n1\n2k ). Then\nδ2k−1/2 = O( n\nδ1/2\n), which is o(n1−cℓ) by equation (2). Thus, |Y ∪ Z| = o(n1−cℓ) and so\n|S′ℓ| = Ω(n\n1−cℓ).\nLet L = n3cℓ. Then, by equation (1), we have L100\nk |V (H)| ≤ n\n1\n2k\n−ε = o(δ). Moreover, by\nequation (2), we have n1−cℓ = ω( n\nδ1/2\n), and by the definition of L, we have n1−cℓ = ω( n\nL1/2\n).\nHence, by Lemma 2.6, the number of L-good paths of length 2k with both endpoints in S′ℓ is\nΩ(\n|S′ℓ|\n2δ2k\nn ). Between any two vertices in S\n′\nℓ there are at most f(2k, L) L-good paths of length\n2k, so the number of pairs (z, y) ∈ S′ℓ×S\n′\nℓ with z ∼ y is Ω(\n|S′ℓ|\n2δ2k\nnf(2k,L)). Thus, there exists some\nxℓ+1 ∈ S\n′\nℓ such that the number of y ∈ S\n′\nℓ with xℓ+1 ∼ y is Ω(\n|S′ℓ|δ\n2k\nnf(2k,L)) ≥ Ω(\nn1−cℓ−2kε\nL52k\n) =\nΩ(n1−cℓ−2kε−3cℓ5\n2k\n) = Ω(n1−cℓ+1). Set Sℓ+1 to be the set of these y ∈ S\n′\nℓ, and note that\nproperties (i)-(iv) are satisfied for ℓ+ 1.\n3 Short paths\nOur aim in this section is to prove the following lemma.\nLemma 3.1. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum de-\ngree δ ≥ L100\nk|V (H)|. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to |V (H)| and K,\nthe number of paths of length k that are not good is O(nδ\nk\nL ).\nThe proof of this is almost identical to that of Lemma 6.4 in [3], nevertheless we include\nit here for completeness and since some minor details need to be modified.\nThe next definition is for notational convenience.\nDefinition 3.2. A pair of distinct vertices (x, y) in G is said to be (ℓ, L)-bad for some\n2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k and some L if there is an L-admissible, but not L-good, path of length ℓ from x\nto y.\n5\nIn what follows, for v ∈ V (G), we shall write Γi(v) for the set of vertices u ∈ V (G) for\nwhich there exists a path of length i from v to u and write N(v) = Γ1(v). The next lemma\nis a slight variant of Lemma 6.7 from [3].\nLemma 3.3. Let 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ. Let G be a K-almost-regular graph on n vertices\nwith minimum degree δ > 0. Let X,Y,Z ⊂ V (G) be such that |Z| ≤ L1/10, |Y | ≤ (Kδ)ℓ−1\nand, for any x ∈ X, the number of y ∈ Y such that (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad is as at least (Kδ)\nℓ−1\nf(ℓ−1,L)2\n.\nThen, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to k and K, there exist a path of length\n2i in G, disjoint from Z, whose endpoints form a set R ⊂ Y , and a subset X ′ ⊂ X such that\n|X ′| ≥ |X \\ Z|/(16f(ℓ − 1, L)2) and (x′, r) is (ℓ, L)-bad for every x′ ∈ X ′ and r ∈ R.\nProof. After replacing X by X \\ Z, we may assume X ∩ Z = ∅. Let Y ′ be the set of those\ny ∈ Y for which the number of x ∈ X such that (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad is at least |X|\n2f(ℓ−1,L)2\n. Then\nthe number of (x, y) ∈ X × (Y \\ Y ′) which are (ℓ, L)-bad is at most |X||Y |\n2f(ℓ−1,L)2\n≤ |X|(Kδ)\nℓ−1\n2f(ℓ−1,L)2\n,\nso the number of (x, y) ∈ X × Y ′ which are (ℓ, L)-bad is at least |X|(Kδ)\nℓ−1\n2f(ℓ−1,L)2\n. Now there\nexists some x∗ ∈ X such that there are at least (Kδ)\nℓ−1\n2f(ℓ−1,L)2\nchoices y ∈ Y ′ for which (x∗, y)\nis (ℓ, L)-bad. If a pair (x∗, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad, then there are at least f(ℓ, L) paths of length\nℓ from x∗ to y. Hence, there are at least (Kδ)\nℓ−1\n2f(ℓ−1,L)2\n· f(ℓ, L) = Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3δℓ−1) paths of\nlength ℓ starting at x∗ and ending in Y ′.\nThe number of such paths intersecting Z is at most |Z|ℓ(Kδ)ℓ−1. Indeed, there are at\nmost |Z| choices for the element of Z in the path, at most ℓ choices for its position in the path\nand, given a fixed choice for these, at most (Kδ)ℓ−1 choices for the other ℓ−1 vertices in the\npath. (Note that asX∩Z = ∅, the vertex in Z is not x∗.) But |Z|ℓ(Kδ)ℓ−1 ≤ L1/10ℓKℓ−1δℓ−1,\nso, for L sufficiently large there are Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3δℓ−1) paths of length ℓ starting at x∗ and\nending in Y ′ that avoid Z. Moreover, since |Γℓ−i(x\n∗)| ≤ (Kδ)ℓ−i, it follows that there exists\nsome u ∈ Γℓ−i(x\n∗) such that there are Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3δi−1) paths of length i from u to Y ′, all\navoiding Z.\nTake now a maximal set of such paths which are pairwise vertex-disjoint apart from\nat u. We claim that there are Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3) such paths. Suppose otherwise. Then all the\nΩ(f(ℓ−1, L)3δi−1) paths of length i from u to Y ′ intersect a certain set of size o(f(ℓ−1, L)3)\nnot containing u. But there are o(f(ℓ− 1, L)3)δi−1 such paths, which is a contradiction.\nSo we have r = Ω(f(ℓ−1, L)3) paths P1, . . . , Pr of length i from u to Y\n′ which are pairwise\nvertex-disjoint except at u and avoid Z. Let the endpoints of these paths be y1, . . . , yr.\nSince yj ∈ Y\n′ for all j, the number of pairs (x, yj) with x ∈ X which are (ℓ, L)-bad is at\nleast r|X|2f(ℓ−1,L)2 . Therefore, by Jensen’s inequality, for an average x ∈ X there are at least(\nr/(2f(ℓ−1,L)2)\n2\n)\nchoices 1 ≤ j1 < j2 ≤ r such that both (x, yj1) and (x, yj2) are (ℓ, L)-bad.\nSince\n(r/(2f(ℓ−1,L)2)\n2\n)\n≥ ( 1\n4f(ℓ−1,L)2\n)2\n(r\n2\n)\n, there exist 1 ≤ j1 < j2 ≤ r such that the set\nX ′ = {x ∈ X : (x, yj1) and (x, yj2) are (ℓ, L)-bad}\nhas size at least |X|/(4f(ℓ− 1, L)2)2. We can now take R = {yj1 , yj2}, and the union of the\npaths Pj1 and Pj2 is a suitable path of length 2i.\nThe following lemma is a small modification of Lemma 6.8 from [3].\nLemma 3.4. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum de-\ngree δ ≥ L100\nk |V (H)|. Let 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and any v ∈ V (G). Then, provided that L is sufficiently\nlarge compared to |V (H)| and K, the number of L-admissible, but not L-good, paths of the\nform v0vv2v3 . . . vℓ is at most\n2(Kδ)ℓ\nf(ℓ−1,L) .\n6\nProof. Suppose otherwise. Let Y = Γℓ−1(v) and note that |Y | ≤ (Kδ)\nℓ−1. For any x ∈ N(v)\nand any y ∈ Y , the number of L-admissible paths of the form xvv2 . . . vℓ−1y is at most\nf(ℓ − 1, L). Indeed, in any such path, the subpath vv2v3 . . . vℓ−1y is L-good, and for any\nfixed y ∈ Y there are at most f(ℓ − 1, L) such L-good paths. Hence, by assumption, the\nnumber of pairs (x, y) ∈ N(v)× Y such that there is an L-admissible, but not L-good, path\nof the form xvv1 . . . vℓ−1y is at least\n2(Kδ)ℓ\nf(ℓ−1,L)2\n≥ 2|N(v)|(Kδ)\nl−1\nf(ℓ−1,L)2\n. By definition, any such pair\n(x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad. Let X consist of those x ∈ N(v) for which there are at least (Kδ)\nℓ−1\nf(ℓ−1,L)2\nchoices of y ∈ Y such that (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad. Then the number of pairs (x, y) ∈ X × Y\nwhich are (ℓ, L)-bad is at least |N(v)|(Kδ)\nℓ−1\nf(ℓ−1,L)2 , and so |X| ≥\n|N(v)|\nf(ℓ−1,L)2 ≥\nδ\nf(ℓ−1,L)2 .\nOur aim now is to find a copy of H in G, which will yield a contradiction. Write k = jℓ+i\nwith 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ.\nNote that if L is sufficiently large, then\n|X| ≥\nδ\nf(ℓ− 1, L)2\n≥\nL100\nk |V (H)|\nf(ℓ− 1, L)2\n≥\nf(ℓ− 1, L)20|V (H)|\nf(ℓ− 1, L)2\n≥ 2L(16f(ℓ− 1, L)2)2|V (H)|,\nso we may apply Lemma 3.3 repeatedly |E(F )|+ |V (H)| ≤ 2|V (H)| times and still get a set\nX ′ of size at least L. Thus, we find disjoint paths Pe of length 2i for every e ∈ E(F ) whose\nendpoint sets are Re ⊂ Y , and sets Xfinal ⊂ X and U ⊂ Y with |Xfinal| = |U | = |V (H)|\nsuch that V (Pe),Xfinal and U are pairwise disjoint and any pair (x, y) with x ∈ Xfinal and\ny ∈ U∪\n⋃\ne∈E(F )Re is (ℓ, L)-bad. For e ∈ E(F ), let ye−kye−k+1 . . . yek be the path of length 2k\nreplacing the edge e.\nA copy of H in G can now be constructed as follows. For each e ∈ E(F ), map the path\nye−iye−i+1 . . . yei to Pe. Then map, for each e ∈ E(F ), the vertices yei+ℓ, ye−(i+ℓ) to Xfinal in\nan arbitrary injective manner. Also, map each yei+2ℓ , ye−(i+2ℓ) to U in an arbitrary injective\nmanner. More generally, map the vertices yei+aℓ, ye−(i+aℓ) with a ≥ 1 odd to Xfinal in an\narbitrary injective manner and map the vertices yei+aℓ, ye−(i+aℓ) with a ≥ 2 even to U in an\narbitrary injective manner. We then just need to find paths of length ℓ connecting yei+aℓ and\nyei+(a+1)ℓ (and paths of length ℓ connecting ye−(i+aℓ) and ye−(i+(a+1)ℓ)) which are disjoint from\neach other and from the images of the already mapped vertices. Since (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad for\nevery x ∈ Xfinal and y ∈ U ∪\n⋃\ne∈E(F )Re, such paths exist by Lemma 2.5, provided that L is\nsufficiently large.\nCorollary 3.5. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum\ndegree δ ≥ L100\nk |V (H)|. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to |V (H)| and\nK, for any 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, the number of L-admissible, but not L-good, paths of length ℓ is at\nmost n 2(Kδ)\nℓ\nf(ℓ−1,L) .\nNow we are in a position to prove Lemma 3.1.\nProof of Lemma 3.1. Suppose that the path u0u1 . . . uk is not L-good. Take 0 ≤ i <\nj ≤ k with j − i minimal such that uiui+1 . . . uj is not L-good. Then ui . . . uj is L-\nadmissible. For any fixed i, j, by Corollary 3.5, the number of such paths is at most\nn 2(Kδ)\nj−i\nf(j−i−1,L) · 2(Kδ)\nk−(j−i) = 4Kk nδ\nk\nf(j−i−1,L) ≤ 4K\nk nδk\nL . Using that i and j can take at\nmost k+1 values each, it follows that the number of not L-good paths of length k is at most\n(k + 1)24Kk · nδ\nk\nL .\n4 Long paths\nIn what follows, for a vertex x ∈ V (G) and a nonnegative integer i, we write Pi(x) for the\nset of directed paths of length i starting at x. For an element P ∈ Pi(x), we let v(P ) be the\nendpoint of the path P .\n7\nDefinition 4.1. Let i, j be nonnegative integers with i + j < 2k. Call a pair (x, y) of\ndistinct vertices (i, j)-rich if the number of pairs (P,Q) ∈ Pi(x)×Pj(y) such that there are\nat least (|V (H)|+2)(2k+1)+1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length 2k− i− j\nbetween v(P ) and v(Q) is more than (2(i+j)|V (H)|(2k+1)+2(i+1)j)(Kδ)i+j−1 . Otherwise\n(including when x = y) call it (i, j)-poor.\nLemma 4.2. Let G be a graph with maximum degree at most Kδ. Let x, y ∈ V (G) and let\ni, j be nonnegative integers with i + j < 2k. If (x, y) is (i, j)-rich, then there exist |V (H)|\npairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length 2k between x and y.\nProof. Choose a maximal set of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths R1, . . . , Rα between\nx and y and assume that α < |V (H)|. Let T be the set of the vertices appearing in at least\none of these paths. Note that |T | < |V (H)|(2k + 1).\nClaim. If there is a pair (P,Q) ∈ Pi(x)× Pj(y) such that\n(i) P is disjoint from T \\ {x}\n(ii) Q is disjoint from T \\ {y}\n(iii) P and Q are vertex-disjoint and\n(iv) there are at least (|V (H)|+ 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of\nlength 2k − i− j between v(P ) and v(Q),\nthen there is a path of length 2k between x and y which is internally vertex-disjoint from all\nof R1, . . . , Rα.\nProof of Claim. Clearly, it suffices to find a path of length 2k− i− j between v(P ) and v(Q)\nwhich is disjoint from the vertices of R1, . . . , Rα, P,Q, except for v(P ) and v(Q). But such\na path exists since there are at most (α + 2) · (2k + 1) ≤ (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) vertices in\none of R1, . . . , Rα, P,Q and there are at least (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally\nvertex-disjoint paths of length 2k − i− j between v(P ) and v(Q).\nA path provided by the claim would contradict the maximality of R1, . . . , Rα, so it suffices\nto prove that there are paths P,Q satisfying (i)-(iv) above.\nSince the maximum degree of G is at most Kδ, the number of paths of length i − 1\nin G intersecting T is at most i|T |(Kδ)i−1, so the number of P ∈ Pi(x) which have a\nvertex in T \\ {x} is at most 2i|T |(Kδ)i−1. Since |Pj(y)| ≤ (Kδ)\nj , the number of pairs\n(P,Q) ∈ Pi(x) × Pj(y) failing condition (i) above is at most 2i|T |(Kδ)\ni−1(Kδ)j . Similarly,\nthe number of pairs failing (ii) is at most 2j|T |(Kδ)j−1(Kδ)i. Finally, for every P ∈ Pi(x),\nthe number of paths of length j − 1 which intersect P is at most (i + 1)j(Kδ)j−1, so the\nnumber of pairs (P,Q) ∈ Pi(x)×Pj(y) for which P and Q share a vertex other than y is at\nmost (Kδ)i · 2(i+1)j(Kδ)j−1. So the number of pairs which fail at least one of (i),(ii),(iii) is\nat most (2(i+ j)|T |+ 2(i+ 1)j)(Kδ)i+j−1 ≤ (2(i+ j)|V (H)|(2k + 1) + 2(i+ 1)j)(Kδ)i+j−1.\nBy the definition of (i, j)-richness of (x, y) it follows that there is a pair (P,Q) satisfying\n(i)-(iv).\nDefinition 4.3. For a vertex v ∈ V (G) and some 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, define an auxiliary graph\nGℓ(v) as follows. The vertices of Gℓ(v) are the (k+1)-tuples (u0, u1, . . . , uk) ∈ V (G)\nk+1 with\nu0 = v such that uiui+1 ∈ E(G) for all i. Vertices (u0, . . . , uk) and (u\n′\n0, . . . , u\n′\nk) are joined by\nan edge if v, u1, u2, . . . , uk, u\n′\n1, . . . , u\n′\nk are distinct and there exist 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1 such that\nthe pair (uℓ, u\n′\nℓ) is (i, j)-rich. Since the vertex set of Gℓ(v) does not depend on ℓ, we may\ndefine G(v) to be the union\n⋃\n1≤ℓ≤k Gℓ(v).\n8\nLemma 4.4. Let G be a graph with maximum degree at most Kδ which does not contain H\nas a subgraph. Let t = |V (F )|. Then for any v ∈ V (G) and any 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, the graph Gℓ(v)\nis Kt-free.\nMoreover, let r = Rk(t) be the k-colour Ramsey number. Then G(v) is Kr-free.\nProof. Suppose that Gℓ(v) contains Kt as a subgraph. Let the corresponding vertices be the\nvectors u1, . . . , ut. Let their respective (ℓ + 1)th coordinate be u1ℓ , . . . , u\nt\nℓ. For every a 6= b,\nsince uaub is an edge in Gℓ(v), it follows that u\na\nℓ and u\nb\nℓ are distinct, and, by Lemma 4.2,\nthere exist |V (H)| pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length 2k between them. It is\nnot hard to see that this implies that there is a copy of H in G in which the vertices of F\nare mapped to u1ℓ , . . . , u\nt\nℓ. This is a contradiction, so Gℓ(v) is indeed Kt-free.\nSuppose there is a copy of Kr in G(v). Then each edge in this Kr can be coloured with\none of the colours 1, 2, . . . , k such that if an edge gets colour i, then it lies in Gi(v). By the\ndefinition of r, there exists a monochromatic Kt in this k-edge-coloured Kr, which gives a\nKt in some Gℓ(v), contradicting the first paragraph.\nThe next lemma provides us a large set of walks of length 2k with both endpoints in S.\nLater, we will argue that most of them are L-good paths.\nLemma 4.5. Let r = Rk(t) denote the k-colour Ramsey number where t = |V (F )|. Let G\nbe an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum degree δ and let S ⊂ V (G)\nsuch that |S| ≥ 2nr/δk. Then there are at least |S|\n2δ2k\n4r2n\nvectors (u−k, . . . , uk) ∈ V (G)\n2k+1\nwith the following properties\n(i) u−k ∈ S, uk ∈ S\n(ii) uℓuℓ+1 ∈ E(G) for every −k ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1\n(iii) (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor for every 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and every 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1.\nProof. Since the minimum degree of G is δ, the number of (k + 1)-tuples (v0, v1, . . . , vk) ∈\nV (G)k+1 with vk ∈ S and vivi+1 ∈ E(G) for every 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 is at least |S|δ\nk. Writing\nT (v0) for the set of such vectors for a fixed v0 and letting g(v0) = |T (v0)|, we get that∑\nv0∈V (G)\ng(v0) ≥ |S|δ\nk. Note that\n∑\nv0∈V (G):g(v0)<r\ng(v0) ≤ nr ≤\n|S|δk\n2 , so\n∑\nv0∈V (G):g(v0)≥r\ng(v0) ≥\n|S|δk\n2\n. (3)\nNote that T (v0) ⊂ V (G(v0)). By Lemma 4.4, the graph G(v0)[T (v0)] is Kr-free. This graph\nhas g(v0) vertices, so if g(v0) ≥ r, then the number of non-edges in G(v0)[T (v0)] is at least\n1\n(r2)\n(g(v0)\n2\n)\n≥ g(v0)\n2\nr2\n. But if v = (v0, v1, . . . , vk) ∈ T (v0) and v\n′ = (v0, v\n′\n1, . . . , v\n′\nk) ∈ T (v0) are\nsuch that vv′ is not an edge in G(v0), then (u−k, . . . , uk) = (v\n′\nk, v\n′\nk−1, . . . , v\n′\n1, v0, v1, . . . , vk)\nsatisfies all three properties in the statement of the lemma. Therefore the number of such\n(2k + 1)-tuples with u0 = v0 is at least\ng(v0)2\nr2\nprovided that g(v0) ≥ r. By (3) and Jensen’s\ninequality, we get\n∑\nv0∈V (G):g(v0)≥r\ng(v0)2\nr2\n≥ |S|\n2δ2k\n4r2n\n, and the proof is complete.\nThe following simple lemma shows that most walks of length 2k are paths.\nLemma 4.6. Let G be a graph on n vertices with maximum degree at most Kδ. Then the\nnumber of (2k+1)-tuples (u−k, . . . , uk) ∈ V (G)\n2k+1 such that uiui+1 ∈ E(G) for every i and\nui = uj for some i 6= j is at most\n(2k+1\n2\n)\nK2k−1 · nδ2k−1.\n9\nProof. There are\n(\n2k+1\n2\n)\nways to choose the pair {i, j} and there are n ways to choose\nui = uj. Given any such choices, there are at most (Kδ)\n2k−1 ways to choose the vertices ub\nfor b 6∈ {i, j} since any vertex in G has degree at most Kδ.\nOur strategy now is to take all the paths guaranteed by Lemmas 4.5 and 4.6 and discard\nthose which contain a subpath of length k which is not L-good. The next result shows that\ndoing this we discard only a small proportion of the paths.\nLemma 4.7. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum degree\nδ ≥ L100\nk |V (H)|. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to |V (H)| and K, the\nnumber of paths u−ku−k+1 . . . uk of length 2k in G with the property that there is some\n−k ≤ j ≤ 0 for which the path ujuj+1 . . . uj+k is not L-good is O(\nnδ2k\nL ).\nProof. By Lemma 3.1, there are O(nδ\nk\nL ) paths ujuj+1 . . . uj+k which are not L-good, and\nsince the maximum degree of G is at most Kδ, there are at most 2(Kδ)k ways to extend\nsuch a path to a path u−ku−k+1 . . . uk of length 2k. The result follows after summing these\nterms for all −k ≤ j ≤ 0.\nThe next lemma is the first step to relate the notion of L-goodness with the notion of\n(i, j)-richness.\nLemma 4.8. Suppose that u−ku−k+1 . . . uk is a path in G which is not L-good but each of\nits subpaths of length k is L-good. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to\n|V (H)|, there exist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α+β > k such that there exist (|V (H)|+2)(2k+1)+1\npairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length α+ β between u−α and uβ .\nProof. Choose −k ≤ i < j ≤ k with j − i minimal such that uiui+1 . . . uj is not L-good.\nBy the minimality of j − i, every proper subpath of uiui+1 . . . uj is L-good, so uiui+1 . . . uj\nis L-admissible. By Lemma 2.5, there exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally\nvertex-disjoint paths of length j − i between ui and uj.\nBy the assumption that every subpath of u−ku−k+1 . . . uk of length k is good, we have\nj − i > k, so i < 0 and j > 0. Thus, the choices α = −i and β = j satisfy the conditions\ndescribed in the lemma.\nThe next result is the final ingredient to the proof of Lemma 2.6.\nLemma 4.9. Let G be a graph on n vertices with maximum degree at most Kδ. Then there\nare O(nδ2k−1) paths u−ku−k+1 . . . uk in G with the following two properties\n(i) (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor for every 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and every 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1 and\n(ii) there exist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α+ β > k such that there exist (|V (H)|+ 2)(2k + 1) + 1\npairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length α+ β between u−α and uβ.\nProof. Fix a pair (α, β) with 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k and α + β > k. It suffices to prove that the\nnumber of paths satisfying (i) and (ii) for this pair (α, β) is O(nδ2k−1).\nLet ℓ = α+β−k. Note that 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k. Also, let i = α− ℓ = k−β and j = β− ℓ = k−α.\nObserve that 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1.\nSuppose that u−ℓu−ℓ+1 . . . uℓ is a path such that (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor. By the definition\nof (i, j)-poorness, the number of pairs of paths (u−ℓu−ℓ−1 . . . u−α, uℓuℓ+1 . . . uβ) such that\nthere exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length α +\nβ = 2k − i − j between u−α and uβ is O(δ\ni+j−1). Thus, the number of ways to extend\nu−ℓu−ℓ+1 . . . uℓ to a path u−ku−k+1 . . . uk possessing property (ii) with our fixed choice of α\nand β is O(δi+j−1 · (Kδ)k−α+k−β) = O(δ2k−2ℓ−1), where the first factor bounds the number\n10\nof possible ways to extend to u−αu−α+1 . . . uβ, and the second factor bounds the number\nof possible ways to extend that to u−ku−k+1 . . . uk. The number of possible choices for\nu−ℓu−ℓ+1 . . . uℓ is O(nδ\n2ℓ), so the result follows.\nWe are now in a position to complete the proof of Lemma 2.6.\nProof of Lemma 2.6. The condition |S| = ω( n\nδ1/2\n) implies that nδ2k−1 = o( |S|\n2δ2k\nn ), so by\nLemmas 4.5 and 4.6, there are Ω( |S|\n2δ2k\nn ) paths u−ku−k+1 . . . uk with both endpoints in S\nsuch that (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor for every 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and every 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1. Discard all\nthose paths among these in which there is a subpath of length k which is not L-good. By\nLemma 4.7, we discarded O(nδ\n2k\nL ) paths, which is o(\n|S|2δ2k\nn ), by the condition |S| = ω(\nn\nL1/2\n).\nOf the remaining paths, discard all those for which there exist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α+ β > k\nsuch that there exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of\nlength α+β between u−α and uβ. By Lemma 4.9, there are O(nδ\n2k−1) such paths, which is\nagain o( |S|\n2δ2k\nn ). Hence, we are left with Ω(\n|S|2δ2k\nn ) paths.\nWe claim that each such path is L-good. Suppose otherwise, and take a path u−ku−k+1 . . . uk\nwhich is not L-good. Since each of its subpaths of length k is L-good, by Lemma 4.8 there\nexist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α + β > k such that there exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise\ninternally vertex-disjoint paths of length α+β between u−α and uβ . But we discarded these\npaths, which is a contradiction, and the proof is complete.\nReferences\n[1] N. Alon, M. Krivelevich, and B. Sudakov.

Furthermore, peaks of \nTNF-a and sTNFRI levels were signil¢.antly higher in group B than respective \npeaks ot cylokine levels in group A (TNF-a: group B 19.2 :~ 3.7 vs group A \n6.2 :~ 1.7 pg/ml, p < 0.01; sTNFRI: group B 4.1 ~ 1.1 vs group A 2.9 ± 0.6 \nng/ml, p < 0.01) and healthy controls (TNF-a: 3.5 • 1.1 Wml and sTNFRI: \n1.9 • 0.1 ng/ml, p -~ 0.001). In group B regression analysis revealed that the \npeak of TNF-a levels significantly correlated with peak of sTNFRI levels (r = \n0.60, p < 0.01), white blood cell counts (r = 0.50, p ~ 0.05), peak of serum \nCK MB isoenzyme (r = 0.67, p ,~ 0.01) and ejec,=on fra,.'tmn (r = -0.61, p - \n0.01). In the same patients, the peak ol sTNFRt lev=ls was also significantly \ncorrelated with white blood cell counts (r = 0.60, p ~- 0.01), peak o1 serum \nCK MB isoenzyme (r = 0.63, p < 0.01) and ejection fraction (r = -0 .65,  p < \n0.01). Finally, in group B, non survivors (n = 4) had significantly higher peaks \nof TNF-a and sTNFRI levels (both p < 0.05) than those of survivors (n = 11). \nConclusions: These results suggest that proinflammafory cytokine serum \nactivity increases substantially in the two catergories of AMI and TNF-a is a \nmajor cytokine which may be especially implicated in the pathophysiology of \nsevere AMI. This cytokine and its soluble receptor closely correlated with AMI \nseverity anci worsening prognosis and may be used as alternative prognostic \nindicators of severe AML \nAcute Myo~rdilill Infarction: SHOCK and \nVentricular An'hythmlaa \nMonday, March 30, 1998, 3:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m, \nGeorgia WodU Congress Center, west Exhibit Hall LevQI \nPresentation Hour: 4:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m. \nUle ef In tm, lem:  ~ Ce.n t~q~ lu tkm ha \nHV.

"This report is intended to assist the Lyndale Neighborhood Association in finding out more about the underreporting of crime within the Latino community and to help to find alternative ways in which the Lyndale Neighborhood Association can assist the Latino community to report crime without fear or trepidation. A total of eighty-five Latino residents in the Lyndale neighborhood were surveyed. Each individual interviewed expressed their perspectives and/or experiences in reporting or not reporting crime and facing crime or criminal activity in their immediate surroundings. Some of the most common criminal activities that Latino residents face on a daily basis are: assaults, car brake-ins and drug dealings, yet the crime reports that appear in the official Minneapolis Police records do not reflect what the participants expressed during the survey. Some of the report recommendations for the Lyndale Neighborhood Association to effectively assist the Latino community in the Lyndale neighborhood to feel safe and secure when reporting criminal activity are: > Establish a safe place or service where Latino residents who fear retaliation or do not trust police can go and be assisted in reporting crimes and violations. > Develop an even stronger relationship with Minneapolis Police Department Precinct No. 5 to address the concerns and/or fears that Latino residents of the Lyndale Neighborhood have in regards to reporting crime. > Organize the Latino community in Lyndale Neighborhood to serve as self-guardians (Neighborhood Watch) of their street blocks with the assistance of the Lyndale Neighborhood Association and Minneapolis Police Department Precinct No. 5.Conducted on behalf of Lyndale Neighborhood Association.

Whether the appellants Petition for a Writ of \nCertiorari should be denied because it does not satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 46(d) of the Utah Rules of Appellate \nProcedure. \n2. Whether the appellant's Petition for a Writ of \nCertiorari should be denied because it does not satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 46(c) of the Utah Rules of Appellate \nProcedure. \nCOURT OF APPEALS' OPINION \nThe Utah Court of Appeals' opinion in this case, Ashcroft v. \nIndustrial Commission, 855 P.2d 267 (Utah App. 1993), is attached \nhereto as Addendum \"A.\" \nUTAH SUPREME COURT JURISDICTION \nThe Utah Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review a Petition \nfor a Writ of Certiorari pursuant to Utah Code Ann. §§ 78-2-\n2(3)(a) (1992), 78-2-2(5) (1992), and Rule 45 of the Utah Rules \nof Appellate Procedure. \nCONTROLLING STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nThe statutes which govern the Utah Supreme Court's \nacceptance of and deliberation upon a Petition for Writ of \nCertiorari are Utah Code Ann. §§ 78-2-2(3)(a) (1992) and \n78-2-2(5) (1992), as well as Rule 45 and Rule 46 of the Utah \nRules of Appellate Procedure. These provisions (attached hereto \nas Addendum \"B\") indicate that the Supreme Court's certiorari \njurisdiction can be utilized to review decisions of the Utah \nCourt of Appeals, but not decisions of Utah's administrative \ntribunals, when the following circumstances are present: \nReview by a writ of certiorari is not a \nmatter of right, but of judicial discretion, \nand will be granted only for special and \nimportant reasons. The following, while \nneither controlling nor wholly measuring the \nSupreme Court's discretion, indicate the \ncharacter of reasons that will be considered: \n(a) When a panel of the Court of \nAppeals has rendered a decision in \nconflict with the decision of \nanother panel of the Court of \nAppeals on the same issue of law; \n(b) When a panel of the Court of \nAppeals has decided a question of \n2 \nstate or federal law in a way that \nis in conflict with the decision of \nthe Supreme Court; \n(c) When a panel of the Court of \nAppeals has rendered a decision \nthat has so far departed from the \naccepted and usual course of \njudicial proceedings or has so far \nsanctioned such a departure by a \nlower court as to call for an \nexercise of the Supreme Court's \npower of supervision; or \n(d) When the Court of Appeals has \ndecided an important question of \nmunicipal, state or federal law \nwhich has not been, but should be, \nsettled by the Supreme Court. \n[Emphasis added.] \n(See Rule 4 6 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure attached \nhereto as Addendum \"B.\") \nContrary to the contentions raised on page 2 of the \nappellant's Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Utah Code Ann. § 35-\n1-77 (1988) and Utah Industrial Commission Rule R568-1-9(A) \n(which deal with the Industrial Commission's use of medical \npanels) are not \"controlling statutes\" pertinent to the Utah \nSupreme Court's review of the Certiorari Petition. The Court of \nAppeals properly refused to even address whether the aforesaid \nstatute and rule have any applicability to the appellant's \nassignment of Industrial Commission error. The Court's Ashcroft \ndecision, attached as Addendum \"A,\" simply affirms the Industrial \nCommission's ruling that the appellant failed to come forward \n3 \nwith competent medical evidence in support of his claim of an \nimpairment rating greater than 5%. Accordingly, the appellant's \nCertiorari Petition is nothing more than an attempt to \ndemonstrate that the Court of Appeals somehow committed serious \nerror in affirming the Industrial Commission's evidentiary \nrulings. Nowhere does the appellant's Certiorari Petition come \nclose to demonstrating such error. Rather, the appellant focuses \non § 35-1-77 and R568-1-9, and thereby improperly asks the \nSupreme Court to conduct a de novo review of the Industrial \nCommission's Final Order rather than an analysis of the Court of \nAppeals' opinion. His Certiorari Petition, therefore, fails to \naddress the Rule 46 considerations deemed pertinent by the Utah \nSupreme Court. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Nature of the Case, Course of Proceedings, and \nDisposition Below. \nThe above-entitled action derives from an industrial \naccident that occurred on September 25, 1989. (R. I.)1 \nFollowing Mr. Ashcroft's industrial injury, he and the appellees \nentered into a Compensation Agreement which included a \nxThe designation \"R. 1.\" refers to page 1 of the record on \nappeal transmitted by the Industrial Commission to the Utah Court \nof Appeals. \n4 \nStipulation indicating that Mr. Ashcroft had sustained a 5% \npermanent impairment due to his industrial accident. (See the \nparties' Compensation Agreement attached hereto as Addendum \"C.\") \nFollowing settlement of the claim, Mr. Ashcroft decided that \nhe would ask the Industrial Commission to increase his permanent \nimpairment rating and award him additional compensation and \nmedical expense benefits. (R. 1.) After the submission of \nnumerous medical records, and an Industrial Commission hearing \nconducted by Administrative Law Judge Lisa-Michele Church, an \nOrder was entered denying the relief sought by Mr. Ashcroft. \n(R. 39.) (See the Administrative Law Judge's Findings of Fact, \nConclusions of Law and Order attached hereto as Addendum MD.fl) \nMr. Ashcroft then filed a Motion for Review with the Industrial \nCommission (R. 47.) In his Motion, Mr. Ashcroft argued (without \nreference to any evidence contrary to his position) that the \nrelief he had requested was generally supported by \"objective \nevidence.\" He also argued that the administrative law judge had \ncommitted prejudicial error in failing to submit the case to a \nmedical panel when the medical evidence contained a supposed \nconflict between physicians' impairment ratings. Following its \nconsideration of the record evidence, the Industrial Commission \ncorrectly found that no medical evidence conflict existed, and \nthe Commission affirmed the administrative law judge's Order. \n5 \n(R. 64.) (See the Industrial Commission's final Order attached \nhereto as Addendum \"E.\") \nMr. Ashcroft then appealed the Industrial Commission's final \nOrder (R. 69), and filed a Rule 10 Motion for Summary Disposition. \n(R. 106.) The Rule 10 Motion was denied. Following oral argument \non the merits of the case, the Court of Appeals upheld the \nIndustrial Commission's refusal to use a medical panel on the \ngrounds that the appellant failed to come forward with competent \nmedical evidence which could have justified referral of the evidence \nto a medical panel. (See Addendum \"A.\") The Court also concluded \nthat the Industrial Commission erred when it used the phrase \n\"substantial evidence\" in reviewing the Administrative Law Judge's \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order. Accordingly, the \ncase was remanded to the Industrial Commission so that the \nappropriate \"preponderance of evidence\" standard of review could be \napplied. \nB. Statement of Background Facts. \nAs a preliminary matter, appellees should point out that the \n\"Statement of Facts\" contained in the applicant's Certiorari Brief \nare not the facts which were adopted by the Industrial Commission or \nby the Court of Appeals. In the Statement of Facts outlined below, \nappellees present the pertinent facts as found by the Industrial \nCommission and as relied upon by the Court of Appeals. \n6 \nOn September 25, 1989, Mr. Ashcroft sustained an industrial \ninjury while unloading freight from a truck. (R. 1.) \nMr. Ashcroft promptly reported his injury and left work to seek \nmedical treatment. \nIn the emergency room, x-rays were taken, and Mr. Ashcroft was \ngiven muscle relaxants and pain medication. (No medical records are \navailable from this visit.) Mr. Ashcroft then consulted with Dr. \nMcGregor, his family physician, on September 28, 1989. (R. 130.) \nDr. McGregor continued to see Mr. Ashcroft for two months. (R. \n130.) Dr. McGregor's records indicate a diagnosis of bulging \ndisc/spinal stenosis and refer the applicant to Dr. Bliss, a \nneurosurgeon. (R. 13 0.) \nDr. Bliss saw Mr. Ashcroft on October 20, 1989, and diagnosed \n\". . . central disc herniation with minor spinal stenosis at this \nlevel.\" He recommended conservative treatment. (R. 146.) In \nDecember, 1989, Dr. Bliss noted Mr. Ashcroft's continuing bilateral \nleg pain and reviewed his myelogram and CT scan. (R. 150.) Dr. \nBliss diagnosed \" . . . sciatica-like symptoms with central disc \nherniation and no definite evidence of neural impingement.\" Mr. \nAshcroft was then referred to Dr. Moress for a neurological consult. \n(R. 150.) \nDr. Moress saw Mr. Ashcroft on February 1, 1990 and recommended \na complete myelography. (R. 155.) Dr. Bliss reviewed this \n7 \nrecommendation and noted \" . . . MRI scan of c. spine demonstrates \nmultilevel disc disease. [Emphasis added.] Previous lumbar \nmyelogram and CT scan demonstrated multiple level bulging discs \nwithout definite stenosis. [Emphasis added.]11 (R. 151.) Later in \nthe same report, Dr. Bliss states, \"patient clearly interprets all \nof his problems as stemming from his recent accident although \nmultiple level disc disease indicates that he has had pre-existing \nproblems and in addition, back pain is not his major complaint at \nthis time. [Emphasis added.]\" (R. 151.) \nOn February 2, 1990, in response to an inquiry from the State \nVocational Rehabilitation Office, Dr. Bliss described \nMr. Ashcroft's status as \"medically stable for return to limited \nemployment in nonlaboring activity.\" (R. 153.) Further, \nMr. Ashcroft testified at his May 19, 1992 Industrial Commission \nhearing that he had applied for unemployment benefits in late 1989. \n(R. 41.) \nOn April 12, 1989, Mr. Ashcroft consulted another orthopedic \nphysician, Dr. Neal Capel. Dr. Capel recommended a program of \nconditioning for Mr. Ashcroft. (R. 158.) \nOn May 10, 1990, Dr. Capel described a visit \nMr. Ashcroft had made to the emergency room for intrascapular pain \nand noted, \" . . . [t]he most likely explanation is an anxiety \nreaction with somatization.\" (R. 159.) Dr. Capel continued to \n8 \nrecommend swimming, bicycle riding and general conditioning, noting \nthat Mr. Ashcroft was to begin an architectural drafting course at \nDixie College on May 22, 1990. (R. 159.) \nDr. Capel's June 5, 1990 office note states, \" . . . [t]he \npatient has no change in his status and was given a work release. \nHe has a job as a cook that is eminent [sic] and was given a release \nfrom the welfare department.11 (R. 160.) Mr. Ashcroft testified at \nthe hearing that he did apply for the cook position, but following \nthis work release he chose not to return to work and began attending \nschool at Dixie College. (R. 41.) \nOn July 12, 1990, Dr. Capel stated that the sitting required by \nMr. Ashcroft's school activities was making him uncomfortable. He \nalso had some aching muscles. (R. 161.) Later in the summer, Dr. \nCapel prescribed Xanax for Mr. Ashcroft's anxiety symptoms. (R. \n162.) \nMr. Ashcroft began working for his father in his father's \ngrocery store in Arizona in September, 1990. (R. 163.) This job \nlasted a few weeks. Dr. Capel's September 20, 1990 office note \nstates, \" . . . [h]e has found that the back did fairly well but his \nlegs got tired as he was on his feet all day on concrete.\" (R. \n163.) Dr. Capel continued to prescribe Xanax and Naprosyn. (Id.) \nDr. Capel's notes for a November 13, 1990 visit indicate that \nMr. Ashcroft was having back and leg pain, and had discontinued some \n9 \nof his conditioning activities. (R. 164.) Dr. Capel's November \n29, 1990 office notes describe a \"new episode\" of back pain \noccurring when Mr. Ashcroft lifted firewood and had a \". . . sudden \nonset of low back pain...\" (R. 165.) On the basis of this new \nepisode, Dr. Capel diagnosed facet syndrome and low back strain. \n(Id.) \nAt his January 29, 1991 office visit, Mr. Ashcroft reported to \nDr. Capel that he had worked in his father's grocery store again \nduring Christmas and experienced leg aches. (R. 166.) He requested \na prescription of Ascendin, but Dr. Capel declined to prescribe it \ndue to side effects. \nAt Mr. Ashcroft's visit with Dr. Capel on March 15, 1991, Dr. \nCapel reported another new episode of back pain: \"The patient has \nbeen getting along reasonably well until March 14, 1991, when he \nbent down to clean up manure from his dog. He developed a sudden \npain in the low back and had difficulty standing up straight.\" (R. \n167.) Dr. Capel concluded that the applicant had had a recurrence \nof iliolumbar strain sprain and, \" . . . I further advised him that \nas far as the Industrial Commission is concerned, he is an \nadministrative catch 22 situation where he cannot force them to \nassume care of his present complaint and while it is possibly \nassociated in quality relation, it is a new episode.\" (R. 167.) \n10 \nFollowing Dr. Capel's treatment, the applicant was examined by \nDr. D. R. McNaught on May 8, 1991. (R. 174.) Dr. McNaught \nconcluded that Mr. Ashcroft did have severe sciatica, due to the \nbulging of lumbar discs L4,5 and possibly LS. He recommended that \nthe applicant investigate surgery, although Dr. McNaught expressed \nsome reservations about that approach. (R. 189.) \nMr. Ashcroft was not able to pursue surgical intervention on \nhis back, due at least partially to the fact that he has Acquired \nImmune Deficiency Syndrome. The medical records indicate that Mr. \nAshcroft tested positive for the HIV virus in the 1980s, and this \ncondition has since developed into AIDS. Dr. Hagen has treated the \napplicant for AIDS since 1989. (R. 120.) He stated in a letter \ndated May 14, 1992, that the applicant's AIDS condition does not \nprevent him from conducting his normal activities; Dr. Hagan's \nrecords also indicate that he treated Mr. Ashcroft for a variety of \nconditions, and that Mr. Ashcroft was taking Prozac for depression. \n(R. 137.) \nDr. McNaught referred the applicant to Dr. John Sanders for \nconsideration of his back condition. (R. 190.) Dr. Sanders \nproduced several reports, including one dated August 9, 1991 which \nconcluded that surgical intervention was not warranted at that time, \nwith no reference to the AIDS factors. (R. 190.) Dr. Sanders also \nwrote a one paragraph report dated October 7, 1991 stating: \". • \n11 \n.It is my opinion that because he is unable to return to his usual \nwork that he should have been given a disability rating of fifteen \npercent on that basis alone.\" (R. 193.) (See Addendum \"F.\") \nDr. Boyd Holbrook performed a file review on the applicant's \ncase on April 10, 1992, and found that the majority of his problems \nwere not industrial in nature. (See Report attached as Addendum \nMG.ff) Dr. Holbrook stated in part, \" . . . [t]his man does have \nsignificant multi-level cervical disc disease that is not related to \nhis industrial injury and is not being considered for any possible \nsurgical treatment and appears to be a relatively minor portion of \nhis symptom complex.\" (Id.) Dr. Holbrook stated that no further \nmedical treatment was needed in connection with Mr. Ashcroft's 1989 \ninjury, because \". . .it does not appear that more medical \nexaminations or more diagnostic studies will assist in the \ndelineation or management of his problem,\" and that Chymopapain \ninjections are not advisable. (See Addendum \"G.\") \nSubsequently, on April 23, 1992, Dr. McNaught dictated an \noffice progress note which indicates that \"I would have suggested a \n10% disability . . . .\" (R. 177.) This \"disability rating\" (which \nMr. Ashcroft now relies upon as a medically sound impairment rating) \ncites no medical records nor the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of \nPermanent Impairment for support.

Because the Industrial Commission \nrefused to convene such a panel, and because the Utah Court of \nAppeals affirmed the Industrial Commission's Order, the appellant \nargues that the Utah Supreme Court must now exercise its certiorari \njurisdiction so that it can instruct the lower courts in the proper \nuse of medical panels. Unfortunately, the appellant has completely \nmisread the Orders entered by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), \nthe Industrial Commission, and the Utah Court of Appeals. The three \nrulings quite clearly indicate that § 35-1-77 and R568-1-9 have no \nrelevance to the facts of this case because those provisions only \ncome into play after the appellant has presented the Industrial \nCommission with competent medical evidence that can, as a threshold \n14 \nmatter, give rise to the need for - ied i cai Dane I.

Consistent with Price River \nand Jensen, the Court of Appeals7 Ashcroft opinion merely defers to \nthe Industrial Commission in its assessment as to whether the \nmedical evidence in this case was sufficient to give rise to the \nneed for medical panel assistance.2 There is no factual or legal \nbasis, therefore, for the appellant's Certiorari Petition under Rule \n46(d). \nAppellant's sole argument during the Industrial Commission \nproceedings below was that a medical panel needed to be convened in \nthis case due to an alleged 5% difference in permanent impairment \nratings assigned to the appellant by different physicians.3 A brief \nreview of the evidence analyzed by the Industrial Commission amply \ndemonstrates that the appellant has never had a meritorious argument \nsupporting his request for medical panel referral. Indeed, the \nadministrative law judge properly observed that the so-called \n2It should be observed that the Ashcroft opinion is narrowly \nlimited to the facts of the present case and will not generally \nextend to those cases where an injured worker or his attorney has \nprovided the Industrial Commission with competent medical evidence. \n3Appellant's arguments that a panel had to be convened due to \nthe Industrial Commission's use of \"summary medical forms\" and due \nto conflicting medical expense and medical stabilization evidence \nare arguments that were never raised at any stage of the Industrial \nCommission proceedings! Clearly, such hindsight arguments (which \nthe appellant obviously wishes he could have made to the Court of \nAppeals) cannot now be considered for the first time in a Rule 46 \ncertiorari context. See, Pease v. Industrial Commission, 694 P. 2d \n613 (Utah 1984). \n16 \n\"ratings\" of McNaught ana rr.

Industrial Commission, 729 P.2d 15 \n(Utah 1986)); Mr. Ashcroft simply failed to submit to the Industrial \nCommission any records containing a well supported impairment \nrating. (See page 7 of Addendum \"D.\") Because of the deference the \nCourt of Appeals affords to Industrial Commission findings of fact, \nand based on the \"reasonableness\" standard of review governing the \nCourt's subject evidentiary issue (under Morton International v. \nAuditing Div., 814 P.2d 581 (Utah 1991)), the Industrial \nCommission's final Order was properly affirmed by the Court of \nAppeals. \nFinally, given all of the new arguments the applicant has \nraised for the first time at the certiorari stage, the appellant is \nreally asking the Supreme Court to grant him a de novo review of the \nIndustrial Commission's final Order. However, as this Court \nrecently stated in Butterfield v. Okubo, 831 P.2d 97, 101, fn. 2 \n(1992) : \n18 \nWe take tnis opportunity to remind the Bar that \nwhen exercis ing our certiorarI j urisdicti on \ngranted by section 78-2-2 (3) (a), we review a \ndecision of the Court of Appeals, not of the \ntrial court. See Utah Code Ann. § 78-2-\n2(3)(a). Therefore, the briefs of the parties \nshould address the decision of the Court of \nAppeals, not the decision of the trial court. \nTo re-state the matter: We do not grant \ncertiorari to review de novo the trial court's \ndecision.

More specifically, \nthe appellant contends that he properly preserved an insufficiency \nof the evidence issue below and that the Court of Appeals' opinion \nshould be reversed due to the Court's conclusion that: \n. . • we deem that Ashcroft has waived the \nissues of sufficiency of the evidence and \nadequacy of the ALJ's findings and that he \ncannot now raise them for the first time on \npetition for judicial review. \n(See Addendum \"A\" at pp. 268-69.) The appellant's Rule 46(c) \nargument lacks merit and should be denied for three reasons. \nFirst, the appellant's argument should be seen for what it is. \nAll that the appellant is asking the Supreme Court to do is re-\nexamine the Motion for Review he filed with the Industrial \nCommission on the grounds that the judges sitting on the Court of \nAppeals bench are apparently incompetent when it comes to evaluating \nlower court pleadings and determining whether certain legal issues \nhave been raised in those pleadings. Appellant's argument must \nfail. The Court of Appeals is amply competent to examine an \nIndustrial Commission Motion for Review and determine whether a \nlegal argument (such as a sufficiency of the evidence argument) is \ncontained in the pleading. The Court of Appeals conducted this \nexamination, and then very clearly stated that the appellant's \nMotion for Review does not contain a sufficiency of the evidence \nchallenge.

Without undertaking the marshalling \nprocess, the appellant never began to challenge the sufficiency of \nthe evidence underpinning the Administrative Law Judge's final \nOrder. Again, a Writ of Certiorari should not be granted under Rule \n46(c) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. \nThird, the appellant mistakenly refers to Rule 49(a)(4) of the \nUtah Rules of Appellant Procedure in arguing that this Court should \ngrant his requested Writ. Rule 49(a)(4) — which provides that a \nstatement of a certiorari issue will be deemed to comprise every \nsubsidiary question fairly included therein\" — applies only in a \ncontext of a certiorari proceeding. The Rule cannot be used to \nsomehow suggest that the appellants' Motion for Review filed with \nthe Industrial Commission must be read in such an overly broad \nfashion that it can be deemed to contain a sufficiency of the \nevidence challenge. In short, the appellant simply has no factual \nor legal basis for arguing that he legitimately raised a sufficiency \nof the evidence challenge.

We affirm in part, reverse in \npart, and remand. \nFACTS ' -\n'On September 25, 1989, Ashcroft sus-\ntained an industrial injury while unloading \nfreight from a truck. The employer's com-\npensation insurer paid temporary total dis-\nability benefits from September 26, 1989 \nthrough June 5, 1990 as well as compensa-\ntion for a five percent permanent partial \nimpairment \nOn September 26, 1991, Ashcroft peti-\ntioned for additional temporary disability \ncompensation, an increased permanent par-\ntial disability rating and medical expenses. \nAshcroft alleged that the same September \n25, 1989 industrial injury rendered him un-\nable to work. -\nAfter a formal hearing, the administra-\ntive law judge (ALJ) denied Ashcroff s \nclaim. The ALJ did not convene a medical \npanel, despite a request by both parties' \ncounsel to do so. The ALJ discounted con-\nelusory statements of two expert witnesses \nregarding Ashcroft's impairment ratings: \nDr. Capel merely recites what the insur-\nance adjustor was offering and post-\npones a rating; Dr. Sanders makes a \nconclusory statement of 15% without ref-\nerence to any underlying facts or indus-\ntrial cause. \nThe ALJ made findings of fact and con-\nclusions of law, which the Commission es-\nsentially adopted. She determined that \n\"the true cause of [Ashcroft's] continuing \nproblems stem from pre-existing degenera-\ntive problems, intervening non-industrial \nevents, and unrelated health conditions. \nTherefore, his claim fails for lack of medi-\ncal and legal causation/' \nAshcroft moved the Industrial Commis-\nsion for review. In his motion, Ashcroft \nfailed to raise issues regarding sufficiency \nof the evidence and adequacy of the ALJ's \nfindings, concentrating his administrative \nappeal on the ALJ's refusal to convene a \nmedical panel The Commission, after \nadopting the AU's findings, affirmed the \nALJ's denial of benefits. Ashcroft now \nseeks review of the Commission's denial. \n' PRESERVATION OF ISSUES \n[1] We first consider the threshold is-\nsue of whether Ashcroft properly pre-\nserved for review the issues he now raises, \nnamely issues of sufficiency of the evi-\ndence, standard of proof and adequacy of \nthe AU's findings, given that he failed to \nraise these issues before the Commission. \nPease v. Industrial Comm'n, 694 P.2d \n613 (Utah 1984) is dispositive. The Pease \ncourt held that a petitioner, in moving for \nreview, has \"the obligation to raise all the \nissues that could have been presented at \nthat time, and those issues not raised [are] \nwaived.\" Id. at 616; accord Smallwood v. \nIndustrial Comm'n, 841 P.2d 716, 718 n. 1 \n(Utah App.1992). The rationale is that by \nraising an issue at the administrative level, \n\"either the administrative law judge or the \nCommission could have adjudicated the is-\nsue.\" Pease, 694 P.2d at 616. \nAshcroft failed to raise the above issues \nbefore the Commission. Of those issues, \nall except for his claim that the Commis-\nsion employed the wrong standard of \nproof, are claims that could have been pre-\nsented to the Commission. See id. Thus, \nwe deem that Ashcroft has waived the is-\nASHCROFT v. INDUSTRIAL COftTN OF UTAH Utah 269 \nCite o 853 POd 267 (UtahApp. 1993) \nsues of sufficiency of the evidence and \nadequacy of the ALJ's findings and that he \ncannot now raise them for the first time on \npetition for judicial review. Id. Ashcroft \ncould not have raised the claim that the \nCommission employed the wrong standard \nof proof until after the Commission had \nmade its review. Thus, this claim is prop-\nerly before this court even though it is \nraised for the first time on judicial review. \nSTANDARD OF PROOF \n[2] Ashcroft claims the Commission ap-\nplied the wrong standard of proof when it \ndenied his motion for review. In its review \nof the ALJ's decision, the Commission em-\nployed the phrase \"substantial evidence.\" \nThis is not the correct standard. The quan-\ntum of evidence required to prove compens-\nability is a preponderance of the evidence. \nLipman v. Industrial Comm'n, 592 P.2d \n616, 618 (Utah 1979). \nThe distinction between preponderance \nof evidence and substantial evidence is sig-\nnificant A reviewing body, such as this \ncourt, applies the standard of substantial \nevidence to examine whether the record \ncontains evidence supporting the findings \nmade by the trier of fact The reviewing \ncourt does not weigh the evidence, in con-\ntrast a trier of fact including the Commis-\nsion, determines whether the petitioner has \nmet his or her burden of proof, the stan-\ndard being preponderance of the evidence. \nThe Commission's mistake as to the stan-\ndard of proof is not one of mere phraseolo-\ngy. Both Ashcroft and this court are enti-\ntled to know that his proof was evaluated \nunder the correct standard. \nWe therefore remand the claim for the \nCommission to evaluate it under the stan-\ndard of preponderance of the evidence. \nMEDICAL PANEL \nAshcroft claims the Commission acted \nunreasonably and irrationally in not con-\nvening a medical panel. Ashcroft pre-\nserved this issue by including it in his mo-\ntion for review before the Commission. \nSee Pease v. Industrial Comm'n, 694 P.2d \n613, 616 (Utah 1984). \n[3] The \"Commission may refer the \nmedical aspects of [a workers compensa-\ntion] case to a medical panel appomted by \nthe Commission.\" Utah Code Ann. § 35-1-\n77(lXa) (1992) (emphasis added). This stat-\nutory language is permissive, not mandato-\nry. See Intermountain Health Care, Inc. \nv. Industrial Comm'n, 839 P.2d 841, 845 \n(Utah App.1992). \nPursuant to section 35-l-77(lXa), the \nCommission enacted Rule 568-1-9 as a \nguideline in determining if a medical panel \nshould be convened. In contrast to the \nstatute, the wording of the agency rule is \nmandatory: \nA. A panel will be utilized by the Ad-\nministrative Law Judge where: \n1. One or more significant medical is-\nsues may be involved. Generally a sig-\nnificant medical issue must be shown by \nconflicting medical reports/ Significant \nmedical issues are involved when there \nare: \n(a) Conflicting medical reports of per-\nmanent physical impairment which vary \nmore than 5% of the whole person, \nUtah Code Admin.P. R568-1-9 (emphasis \nadded). Thus, the rule requires the Com-\nmission to convene a medical panel when \nthe evidence supports conflicting industrial \nimpairment ratings with more than a five \npercent difference. If the evidence regard-\ning impairment ratings supports ratings \nthat vary by more than five percent as \npetitioner asserts, a medical panel would be \nnecessary to resolve the differences. \nIn short the statute explicitly grants dis-\ncretion to the Commission as to whether to \nconvene a medical panel. The Commission, \nin turn, restricted its own discretion by \npromulgating the Rule requiring it to con-\nvene a medical panel in certain instances. \n[4,51 Our review is pursuant to Utah \nCode Ann. § 63-46b-16(4)(h)(ii) (1987) be-\ncause this issue requires us to consider \nwhether the agency acted contrary to its \nown rule. Thus, \"we will not disturb the \nagency's interpretation or application of \nthe [rule] unless its determination exceeds \nthe bounds of reasonableness and rationali-\n270 u t a h 855 PACIFIC REPORTER, 2d SERIES \nty.\" King v. Industrial Comm'n, 850 \nP.2d 1281, 1286 (Utah App.1993).1 . \nHere, the Commission determined: \nThe bald statement by Dr. Sanders, in \nconnection with his assertion that a 15 \npercent rating was appropriate, was sup-\nported by absolutely no medical analysis \nor logic. We need some justification, and \nin the absence of such, we cannot specu-\nlate. In the case of Dr. Capel, there is \nno statement by him as to any appropri-\nate rating, other than a statement that \nthe adjuster had decided upon a five per-\ncent rating. We therefore conclude that \nthe evidence does not support the appli-\ncant in this regard. \nIn short, the Commission found no specific \nor supported impairment rating in the rec-\nord, much less conflicting impairment rat-\nings. Nor did the Commission find that the \nratings given related to an industrial cause. \nThus, there was no departure from the \nagency rule because the agency rule did \nnot apply. Therefore, we need not consider \nwhether any departure was reasonable and \nrational. \nCONCLUSION \nAshcroft could have, but failed to raise \nthe issues of sufficiency of the evidence \nand adequacy of the AU's findings. We \ntherefore deem that he has waived those \nissues. We affirm the AU's refusal to \nconvene a medical panel as reasonable and \nrational because the A U found no specific \nor supported impairment rating in the rec-\nord. On the other hand, we cannot affirm \nthe Commission's decision because the \nCommission employed the wrong standard \nof proof in its review of the evidence. We \ntherefore reverse the Commission's order \nand remand for the Commission to conduct \na review employing the proper standard of \npreponderance of the evidence. \n1. In the event we determine an agency has in \nfact departed from its own rule, we would then \nconsider whether the departure was reasonable \nand rational.

The defendant insurance carrier denies \nliability on the basis of medical and legal causation. \nAn evidentiary hearing was held, during which oral and written \nevidence was presented. At the conclusion of the evidentiary \nhearing, the matter was taken under advisement by the \nAdministrative Law Judge. Having been fully advised in the \npremises, the Administrative Law Judge now enters the following \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. \nFINDINGS OF FACT: \nThe applicant in this matter, Denis Ashcroft, was employed as \na driver for Airfax Express in 1989, earning 18 cents per mile. He \nwas unmarried with no dependent children at the time of his injury. \nn ^ \nDENIS ASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE TWO \nOn September 25, 1989, the applicant was unloading boxes with a \ndolly to persons on the ground at a Salt Lake K-Mart location, and \nhe bent over and could not straighten up. He felt pain in his \nback, crawled to the edge of the truck bed and called his employer. \nHis employer told him to finish unloading, but Ashcroft had the \nstore employees do it for him. He then drove to another K-Mart and \ndid the same. Ashcroft drove to Ogden, parked the truck, and took \na taxi to the McKay Dee Hospital Emergency Room. \nAt the emergency room, they took x-rays, gave him muscle \nrelaxants and pain medication. No medical records were available \nfrom this visit. Thereafter the applicant rode the bus back to St. \nGeorge. There, he consulted Dr. McGregor, his family doctor, on \nSeptember 28, 1989 (Ex. D-01, p. 5). Dr. McGregor advised complete \nbed rest and continued to see him for two months. Dr. McGregor's \nrecords indicate a diagnosis of bulging disc/spinal stenosis and \nrefer the applicant to Dr. Bliss, a neurosurgeon. \nDr. Bliss saw the applicant on October 20, 1989, and \ndiagnosed, \". . . central disc herniation with minor spinal \nstenosis at this level.11 He recommended conservative treatment. \n(Ex. D-l, p. 19.) \nIn December, 1989, Dr. Bliss noted Ashcroft's continuing \nbilateral leg pain and reviewed his myelogram and CT scan. He \nstated his impression was \"• . • sciatica-like symptoms with \ncentral disc herniation and no definite evidence of neural \nimpingement.\" The applicant was then referred to Dr. Moress for a \nneurological consult. \nDr. Moress saw Ashcroft on February 1, 1990 and recommended a \ncomplete myelography. Dr. Bliss reviewed this recommendation and \nnoted w. . . [Dr. Moress] suspects possible demyelinating disorder \nif symptoms are not explained by stenosis. MRI scan of c. spine \ndemonstrates multilevel disc disease. Previous lumbar myelogram \nand CT scan demonstrated multiple level bulging discs without \ndefinite stenosis.H Later in the same report, Dr. Bliss stated, H. \n. . Patient clearly interprets all of his problems as stemming from \nhis recent accident although multiple level disc disease indicates \nthat he has had pre-existing problems and in addition, back pain is \nnot his major complaint at this time.11 (Ex. D-l, p. 24.) \nOn February 2, 1990, in response to an inquiry from State \nVocational Rehabilitation, Dr. Bliss described Ashcroft's status as \nM\n. . . medically stable for return to limited employment in non-\nlaboring activity.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 26.) The applicant testified \n•- C40 \nDENIS ASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE THREE \nthat he applied for and was denied unemployment benefits in late \n1989, due to a prior lien. \nOn April 12, 1990, the applicant consulted another orthopedic \nphysician, Dr. Neal Capel. Dr. Capel saw him on 4/12/90 and \nrecommended a program of conditioning for Ashcroft. In the notes \nof that visit, Dr. Capel also mentioned, \". . . Liberty Mutual \naccount manager determined his permanent partial disability as 5%, \nMarch 26, 1990, is the cutoff of benefits...The patient will have \nhis disability rating deferred until the conclusion of his work \nhardening and conditioning in 6 weeks.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 32.) \nAt the May 10, 1990, visit with the applicant, Dr. Capel \ndescribed a visit Ashcroft had made to the emergency room for \nintrascapular pain and noted, \" . . . The most likely explanation is \nan anxiety reaction with somatization.\" Dr. Capel continued to \nrecommend swimming, bicycle riding and general conditioning. \nAt the June 5, 1990, visit, Dr. Capel's office notes state, \". \n. . The patient has no change in his status and was given a work \nrelease. He has a job as a cook that is eminent [sic] and was \ngiven a release from the welfare department.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 34.) \nAshcroft testified he did apply for the cook position. Following \nthis work release however, the applicant did not return to work, \nbut began attending school at Dixie College. \nAt the July 12, 1990, office visit, Dr. Capel stated that \nsitting required by the applicants school activities was making \nhim uncomfortable. He also had some aching muscles. Later in the \nsummer, Dr. Capel prescribed Xanax for Ashcroft's anxiety symptoms. \nAshcroft began working for his father in his grocery store in \nArizona in September, 1990. This job lasted a few weeks. Dr. \nCapel/s notes state, \". . .He has found that the back did fairly \nwell but his legs got tired as he was on his feet all day on \nconcrete.\" Dr. Capel continued to prescribe Xanax and Naprosyn. \n(Ex. D-l, p. 37.) \nDr. Capel's notes for November 13, 1990, visit indicate that \nAshcroft was having back and leg pain, and had discontinued some of \nhis conditioning activities. His November 29, 1990, office notes \ndescribe a \"new episode\" of back pain occurring when Ashcroft \nlifted firewood and had, \". . . sudden onset of low back pain...\" \n(Ex. D-l, p. 39.) Dr. Capel diagnosed facet syndrome and low back \nstrain. The applicant testified that this episode involved him \nlifting two or three pieces of wood branches that would fit in his \nfireplace. \n041 \nDENIS ASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE FOUR \nAt his January 29, 1991, office visit, the applicant reported \nto Dr. Capel that he had worked in his father's grocery store again \nduring Christinas and experienced leg aches. He requested a \nprescription of Ascendin, but Dr. Capel declined to prescribe it \ndue to side effects. \nAt Ashcroft's visit with Dr. Capel on March 15, 1991, Dr. \nCapel reported another episode of back pain: MThe patient has been \ngetting along reasonably well until March 14, 1991, when he bent \ndown to clean up manure from his dog. He developed a sudden pain \nin the low back and had difficulty standing up straight.11 Dr. \nCapel concluded that the applicant had had a recurrence of \niliolumbar strain sprain and, \". . .1 further advised him that as \nfar as the Industrial Commission is concerned, He is an \nadministrative catch 22 situation where he cannot force them to \nassume care of his present complaint and while it is possibly \nassociated in quality relation, it is a new episode.\" (Ex. D-l, p. \n41.) Ashcroft testified that he was using a 3/4 length shovel and \nbent over and felt back pain. He then had difficulty straightening \nup. \nFollowing Dr. Capel's treatment, the applicant was examined by \nDr. D.R. McNaught on May 8, 1991. Dr. McNaught concluded that \nAshcroft did have severe sciatica, due to the bulging of lumbar \ndiscs L4,5 and possibly LS. He recommended that the applicant \ninvestigate surgery, although Dr. McNaught expressed some \nreservations about that approach. \nIn fact, the applicant was not able to pursue surgical \nintervention on his back, due at least partially to the fact that \nhe has Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. (Ex. D-l, p. 61-62.) \nThe medical records indicate that Ashcroft tested positive for the \nHIV virus in the 1980s, and this condition has since developed into \nAIDS. (Ex. D-l, p. 10-17.) Dr. Hagen has treated the applicant \nfor AIDS since 1989. He stated in a letter dated May 14, 1992, \nthat the applicant's AIDS condition does not prevent him from \nconducting his normal activities, (Ex. A-l). Hagan's records also \nindicate that he treated Ashcroft for a variety of conditions, and \nthat Ashcroft was taking Prozac for depression. \nDr. McNaught referred the applicant to Dr. John Sanders for \nconsideration of his back condition. Dr. Sanders produced several \nreports, including one dated August 9, 1991, which concluded that \nsurgical intervention was not warranted at that time, with no \nreference to the AIDS factors. Dr. Sanders also wrote a one \nparagraph report dated October 7, 1991 stating: \". . .It is my \nopinion that because he is unable to return to his usual work that \n04? \nDENIS ASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE FIVE \nhe should have been given a disability rating of fifteen percent on \nthat basis alone,H (Ex. D-l, p. 66.) \nDr. Boyd Holbrook performed a file review on the applicant's \ncase on April 10, 1992, and found that the majority of his problems \nwere not industrial in nature. Dr. Holbrook stated in part, H. . \n. This man does have significant multi-level cervical disc disease \nthat is not related to his industrial injury and is not being \nconsidered for any possible surgical treatment and appears to be a \nrelatively minor portion of his symptom complex.11 Dr. Holbrook \nopined that no further medical treatment was needed in connection \nwith Ashcroft's 1989 injury, that, w. . .it does not appear that \nmore medical examinations or more diagnostic studies will assist in \nthe delineation or management of his problem,\" and that Chymopapain \ninjections are not advisable, (Ex. D-l, p. 67). \nAshcroft also sought chiropractic care from Dr. Wageman in St. \nGeorge. Those chiropractic records show the applicant received \ntreatments from September 27, 1991, through December, 1991 for 35 \nvisits. Dr. Wageman believed that Ashcroft suffered, \". . .an \nexacerbation of his post-traumatic injuries sustained in the \noriginal accident,H of 1989 (Ex. A-l). \nThe applicant's medical records indicate that he has undergone \nthe following diagnostic procedures since his industrial injury: x-\nrays (10/89), CT scan (10/89), myelogram-CT scan (12/89), MRI \n(2/90), CT scan (5/91), x-rays (10/91), MRI (10/91). \nThe applicant currently experiences aches in his back and \nlegs. He takes AZT, wellbutrin and dalmane, as well as headache \nmedicines. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \nThe applicant in this matter, Denis Ashcroft, unfortunately \nhas failed to sustain his burden of proof that further temporary \ntotal disability benefits or medical expense benefits are causally \nrelated to his industrial accident of 1989. In fact, according to \nmedical specialists, the true cause of the applicant's continuing \nproblems stem from pre-existing degenerative problems, intervening \nnon-industrial events, and unrelated health conditions. Therefore, \nhis claim fails for lack of medical and legal causation. \nAt the time of the hearing, there was no evidence that \nAshcroft was unable to work during the period of his additional \ntemporary total disability claim. The applicant testified that he \nr>43 \nDENIS ASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE SIX \napplied for unemployment, applied for a job as a cook, and in fact, \nattended school full-time. He also worked in his father's grocery \nstore for a time. Two doctors had released him to work (Dr. Bliss, \n2/2/90) (Dr. Capel, 6/5/90) and considered him medically stable. \nNo other medical provider has taken him off work. Utah workers \ncompensation law is specific on this issue, lf. . . Once a claimant \nreaches medical stabilization, the claimant is moved from temporary \nto permanent status and he is no longer eligible for temporary \nbenefits.11 Booms v. Rapp Construction, 720 P.2d 1363, 1366 (Utah \n1986.) Lack of stabilization is the plaintiff's burden to prove, \nGriffith v. Industrial Commission. 754 P.2d 981 (Ct. of App. Utah \n1988) . \nApplicant's counsel argues that Ashcroft is entitled to \nfurther benefits while he is still in the \"diagnostic\" stage of his \ntreatment for his back injury. Unfortunately, the medical records \nclearly indicate that this case has long ago exhausted the \ndiagnostic stage. In fact, the applicant has been seen by at least \nsix specialists, and has had every possible diagnostic test \nperformed at least twice for his back pain symptoms. The case is \nalso tragically complicated by the presence of the applicant's AIDS \ncondition, which may not have become a \". . .severe medical \nproblem,\" but ultimately is life-threatening and therefore bound to \ninfluence the applicant's choices with regard to surgery, \nemployment, as well as any optional medical treatment. \nFurther, the medical records in this file indicate that the \napplicant's case involves psychological components. Moreover, when \ncarefully reviewed, it is illogical for one to attempt to pin all \nthe troublesome circumstances of a situation on a single incident \nof lumbar strain several years ago, particularly when that \ncondition stabilized within months and was one which the doctors \nrefused to surgically treat. \nApplicant's counsel further argues that the applicant may fall \ninto the rare category of one who suffers a sacroiliac condition \nthat is difficult to diagnose. There is no indication, however, of \nthat suspicion on behalf of Ashcroft's numerous physicians. Such \narguments are speculative and general, and cannot be the basis of \nextending workers compensation benefits indefinitely to the \napplicant. \nThe Administrative Law Judge agrees with Ashcroft's physicians \nwho have identified this case as a complex one, involving pre-\nexisting and psychological factors. In addition, the applicant \nexperienced two subsequent non-industrial events which occurred \nwhen his doctor said he was doing well. The improvement he was \nDENIS ASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE SEVEN \nmaking, together with the strenuous nature of the incidents \nthemselves, render those subsequent events intervening and causally \ncontributing to his continuing back problems. \nAs to the permanent partial impairment rating, the applicant \nwas paid compensation on a 5% whole person permanent partial \ndisability rating by the defendants. The Administrative Law Judge \ndoes not find a specific rating in the records: Dr. Capel merely \nrecites what the insurance adjustor was offering and postpones a \nrating; Dr. Sanders makes a conclusory statement of 15% without \nreference to any underlying facts or industrial cause. Without a \nwell-supported rating in the record, and the Administrative Law \nJudge can only note that a 5% impairment is reasonable for an \nunoperated disc problem according to the AMA Guides To the \nEvaluation of Permanent Impairment, Table 53. \nORDER: \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the claim of the applicant, Denis \nAshcroft, for additional temporary total disability and medical \nexpenses compensation in connection with his industrial injury of \nSeptember 25, 1989, should be and is hereby denied for lack of \nlegal and medical causation. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any Motion for Review of the \nforegoing shall be filed in writing within thirty (30) days of the \ndate hereof, specifying in detail the particular errors and \nobjections, and, unless so filed, this Order shall be final and not \nsubject to review or appeal. \nINDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF UTAH \nJ\\ faJtrUr/i \nLisa-Michele Church \nAdministrative Law \n'•-* J.I--L O\\_^ \nC e r t i f i e d t h i s ^ f f d a y of ^frtuL-\nATTEST: 7 / \nPatricia 0 .

The administrative law judge (ALJ) \nconcluded that the applicant had failed to show legal and medical \ncausation, and therefore denied his claim. It is from this denial \nthat the applicant appeals based on allegations of the following \nerrors: \n1. Rejection by the ALJ of two permanent partial \ndisability ratings in favor of a two year old rating done by the \n\"Liberty Mutual account manager.\" \n2. The failure of the ALJ to order that a medical panel \nbe convened to consider among other items the question of maximum \nmedical improvement. \n3. The ALJ did not consider that the treating doctors \nwere in the diagnostic stages of the case, and the doctors had not \ndecided upon a course of treatment. \n4. The ALJ lost or ignored the chiropractor's results \nthat the applicant was improving with chiropractic treatment. \n5. This case contains objective evidence of several \nradiographically verified disc injuries, and surgery was a \"clear \npossibility but for the complication of the AIDS.\" \nThe respondents argue in rebuttal that the medical evidence \ndid not give rise to the need for a medical panel review, and that \nthere is no conflict in the medical evidence regarding the \napplicant's attainment of maximum medical improvement. We will \nDENIAL OF MOTION \nFOR REVIEW \nCase No. 91000984 \n061 \nASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE TWO \nbriefly discuss the pertinent facts as they relate to the \nallegations of error. \nThere seems to be no dispute about the basic facts of the \noriginal industrial injury, in 1989. At that time, the applicant \nwas a driver for Airfax Express. On September 25, 1989, he was \nusing a dolly to unload boxes at a K-Mart. He bent over, and could \nnot thereafter stand straight. Experiencing pain in his back, he \ncrawled to the edge of his truck, and called his employer. His \nemployer told him to finish unloading.1 He apparently was able to \nhave the K-Mart employees complete the task, and he subsequently \ndrove to another K-Mart where he was again able to have its \nemployees do the same. The applicant then drove to Ogden, parked \nhis truck, and used a taxi to get to a hospital emergency room. \nThe emergency room treatment and procedures consisted of x-\nrays, muscle relaxants, and pain medication. After a trip back to \nSt. George by bus, the applicant was treated by his family doctor, \nDr. McGregor, on September 28, 1989. After a period of bed rest, \nthe applicant was seen by the doctor during the following two \nmonths. Dr. McGregor diagnosed the applicant as having bulging \ndisc/spinal stenosis. The doctor referred the applicant to Dr. \nBliss, a neurosurgeon. \nDr. Bliss saw the applicant on a number of occasions during \nthe period October 20, 1989 through February 20, 1990. The doctor \nrecommended that the applicant receive conservative treatment, and \nstated that \"...Patient clearly interprets all of his problems as \nstemming from his recent accident although multiple level disc \ndisease indicates that he has had pre-existing problems and in \naddition, back pain is not his major complaint at this time.\" \nExhibit D-l, at 24. Further, the doctor concluded on February 2, \n1990 that the applicant was w...medically stable for return to \nlimited employment in nonlaboring activity.11 I£., at 26. \nDuring the period April 12, 1990 through March 15, 1991, the \napplicant was treated by Dr. Capel. Dr. Capel placed the applicant \non a work hardening and conditioning program. On May 10, 1990, the \napplicant experienced intrascapular pain, and went to an emergency \nroom for treatment. The doctor explained this episode as an \nanxiety reaction with somatization, and recommended general \nconditioning, bicycle riding, and swimming. On June 5, 1990, the \napplicant was given a work release, and apparently told the doctor \nthat he had an imminent job as a cook. Apparently, the applicant \ndid not return to work, but instead attended Dixie College as a \nstudent. \nBetween July 12, 1990, and March 15, 1991, the applicant \n063 \nASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE THREE \nexperienced muscle aches, back and leg pain, and anxiety symptoms \non various occasions. Low back pain appeared after the applicant \nlifted two or three pieces of firewood, and a second episode \noccurred when the applicant attempted to clean up some of his dog's \nexcrement. Dr. Capel noted on November 13, 1990 that the applicant \nhad discontinued some of his conditioning exercises. \nIt appears that surgery is either not warranted for the \napplicant's medical problems, or is not recommended due to AIDS \nwhich has developed in the applicant from his initial contact with \nthe HIV in the 1980's. Although one doctor recommended that the \napplicant investigate surgery (Dr. McNaught), another (Dr. Hunter) \nindicated that some surgery may be possible, two other doctors have \nindicated that surgery is not warranted (Dr. Holbrook and Dr. \nSanders) . Dr. Holbrook reviewed the applicant's file and concluded \nthat the majority of the applicant's problems were not industrial \nin nature. The doctor concluded that additional medical \nexaminations or diagnostic studies will not assist in the \n\"delineation or management of [the applicant's] problem [in \nconnection with the 1989 injury....M Exhibit D-l at 67. \nContrary to the view of Dr. Holbrook, and others, is that of \na treating chiropractic physician, Dr. Wageman, who believed that \nthe applicant suffered \"...an exacerbation of his post-traumatic \ninjuries sustained in the original accident...\" of 1989. Exhibit \nA-l. We have concluded that the specialists who determined that \nthe applicant's problems were not industrial in nature outweigh the \nopinion of Dr. Wageman. \nThe ALJ concluded that the applicant had failed to sustain his \nburden of proof that he was further entitled to TTC or to medical \nexpense benefits. There is substantial evidence in the file in \nlight of the entire record to show that the applicant's continuing \nproblems result from conditions unrelated to the industrial \naccident. Thus, the applicant has failed to show medical and legal \ncausation. Under these circumstances, no medical panel is \nnecessary. \nThe file shows that two doctors considered the applicant to be \nmedically stable during the period that the applicant claims \nadditional TTC. As a result, they had released the applicant to \nwork. It is clear that when an injured worker is released from \ntemporary total disability status that TTC should no longer be \nreceived. Booms v. Rapp Construction. 720 P.2d 1363, 1366 (Utah \n1986). \nThe applicant's argument that he was still within the \ndiagnostic stages of treatment is contrary to the evidence. Six \n066 \nASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE FOUR \nspecialists have reviewed his case over time, and the applicant has \nhad numerous diagnostic tests completed. None of the specialists \nwith the possible exception of Dr. Hunter have concluded that \nsurgery is warranted or possible. Dr. Holbrook, for example, \nconcluded that no further examinations or diagnostic tests were \nwarranted. This statement shows that the diagnostic period was \ncomplete. \nThis case is complicated by the applicant's pre-existing \nmedical problems, and by his limitation on medical choices forced \nupon him by AIDS. In addition, the applicant suffered two \nsubsequent nonindustrial accidents which can be considered to be \nintervening and causally contributing events to the applicant's \ncontinuing back problems. \nIn connection with the permanent partial impairment rating, \nthe applicant argues that he should be given a higher rating since \nDr. Sanders indicated that a 15 percent rating was appropriate \nsince the applicant could not work. The applicant also cited Dr. \nCapel as support for this contention that the rating previously \ndetermined at five percent was too low. We note that the applicant \nwas paid for his permanent partial impairment compensation. We \nagree with the ALJ that a five percent impairment is reasonable for \nan unoperated disc problem based upon the Guides to the Evaluation \nof Permanent Impairment. Table 53 (3d ed. rev. 1990) published by \nthe American Medical Association. \nThe bald statement by Dr. Sanders, in connection with his \nassertion that a 15 percent rating was appropriate, was supported \nby absolutely no medical analysis or logic. We need some \njustification, and in the absence of such, we cannot speculate. In \nthe case of Dr. Capel, there is no statement by him as to any \nappropriate rating, other than a statement that the adjustor had \ndecided upon a five percent rating. We therefore conclude that the \nevidence does not support the applicant in this regard. \nUnder the circumstances, we conclude that the ALJ's findings, \nconclusions of law, and order were based upon substantial evidence \nin light of the entire record, and the legal conclusions were \ncorrect. The applicant has failed to prove his case. \nORDER: \nIT IS ORDERED that the order of the administrative law judge \ndated June 29, 1992 is affirmed. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any appeal shall be to the Utah \n067 \nASHCROFT \nORDER \nPAGE FIVE \nCourt of Appeals within 30 days of the date hereof, pursuant to \nUtah Code Annotated, Sections 35-1-82.53(2), 35-1-86, and 63-46b-\n16.

K. McGreg-\nor September 28, 1989 with acute low back pain and profound \nmuscle spasm in all directions and pain radiating down to the \nmidposterior thigh. It notes \"injury to lower back while unload-\ning a trailer\". \n10-20-89 He was seen by Donald G. Bliss, M.D. who completed a \ncomprehensive evaluation. MHe was lifting boxes while unloading \na truck on 9-25-89 when he had a sudden severe pain in his back. \nThe pain was like a \"ripping sensation\" and he had a hot burning \nsensation going up into his neck\". The pain was so severe he \nwent to the emergency room. He has gradually improved with \ntreatment but suddenly worse six days ago radiating into the \nleft and then the right leg. He has had some intermittent minor \nlow back pain on occasion with work in the past. On examination \nhe found a slight list to the left. Some difficulty arising from \nthe bent position and SLR 45 degrees. Reflexes, sensation and \nmotor power normal but not tested in detail. X-rays felt to be \nnormal. CT scan 10-17-89 shows a symmetrical central bulge at \nthe L-3-4 disc with some compromise of the spinal canal but no \nroot impingement. He recommended conservative treatment but noted \nPage two \nRe : Denis B. Ashcroft \nand continued under the care of Dr. Bliss with bilateral leg pain \nseverely aggravated my myelogram. He had mild persistent pares-\nthesia in his toes. Myelogram and CT show significant disc bulg-\ning at three levels but the spinal canal is fairly capacius with-\nout specific nerve root involvement. \n2-1-90 He was evaluated by Dr. Gerald Moress. His back pain is al-\nmost gone and he only notices it now when bends over or does some \nlifting. Beginning in October he started having impotence. He \nhas now noticed some tingling in the upper extremities. He found \nno evidence of spinal stenosis and sensory findings in upper and \nlower extremities. He believed the pathology was within the cer-\nvical cord, either a hard disc or some demyelating disease and \nrecommended complete myelography and CSF studies. \n26 February 1990 MRI of the cervical spine with the following im-\npression: \n1. Multilevel cervical spine disease (narrowing including for-\naminal narrowing and prominence of the facet joints. \n2. Small herniated discs at C-4-5 and C-6-7 levels. \n3. Mild concentric posterior bulge at C-5-6 level. \n4. Mild to moderate narrowing at the intervertebral foramina \nat multiple levels as described. \n2-27-90 Dr. Bliss recommended review with Dr. Moress. Patient \nclearly interprets all of his problems as stemming from his recent \naccident although multiple level disc disease indicates that he \nhas had pre-existing problems and in addition, back pain is not \nhis major complaint at this time. \nMarch 22, 1990 he was examined by Neal C. Capel, M.D. who per-\nformed a complete study. He has burning discomfort from D-7 - L-2, \nmidline in both right and left paravertebral and ache in posterior \nthighs to the knees and calves with numbness. He further described \nhis symptoms and x-rays. His diagnosis was acute low back strain \nand sprain with dysesthesiasbut no definite root signs with multi-\nple segment disc protrusions most prominently 5-S-l with degener-\native disc segments. Psychosocial changes are quite prominent \nin the clinical context. He has not moved toward employability \nin his mind at all and has a passive approach. Most of the changes \npre-existed the accident date. He should have a vigorous condit-\nioning program followed by a rating of 5% impairment of the whole \nperson. He is not a candidate for surgical intervention and fur-\nther treatment measures or evaluation measures would probably best \nbe applied to psychodynamic study and psychiatric consultation \nas he believes these factors are impacting his disability. \nHe subsequently was on an exercise program and taking architect-\nviral drafting at Dixie College.

His back did fairly \nwell, but his legs got tired as he was on his feet all day on \nconcrete. He is back in school again now. \n11-13 He had the flu in the last 2 to 3 weeks and has not been \ncarrying out his proper rehabilitation program. \n11-29-90 New episode. On Sunday last, November 25th the patient \npicked firewood with sudden onset of low back pain more on the \nright. His diagnosis was facet syndrome and low back strain. \nHe worked in his parent's grocery store about a month at Christ-\nmas time, has difficulty straightening up, has had psychological \ncounseling and was again noted to have normal objective examinat-\nion with subjective complaints. He recommended he continue his \nexercise program. By 3-15-91 he was getting along reasonably \nwell until March 14th when he bent down to clean manure from his \ndog and sudden pain in the low back and trouble standing up. \nBed rest was recommended. \n9-26-91 He was in requesting that Dr. Capel relate the lifting \nof firewood episode November 25th to the accident of 9-25-89. \nHe has been seeing other doctors for MRl and surgical considerat-\nion. \"I have, of course, made that decision long ago\". \nMRI 4 October 1991 with the following impression: \n1. Multiple degenerative disc disease with Grade II central \nbulge L-2-3, Grade I-XI central bulge L-3-4 and L-4-5, and \nGrade I central and slightly to the right central bulge \nL-4-S-1. \n2. Borderline to moderate central spinal stenosis L-2-3. \n3. Mild facet arthritis multiple levels with mild left foraminal \nstenosis L-5-S-1. \nWillard S* Hunter, M.D., Phoeniz, Arizona reported October 14, 1991 \nan absence of his right ankle reflex not previously noted, limitat-\nion of straight leg raising at 30 degrees on the right and 50 de-\ngrees on the left, decreased sensation outer aspect of the right \nfoot and rather severe cervical disc disease which cannot be treat-\ned except by an open operative intervention. Because of the recent \nchange he recommended Chymofast test. I think he now has a herniat-\ned disc at L-5-S-1. I advised that he could be injected. \nDr. Hunter later noted that the decision regarding surgical inter-\nvention is affected by his HIV status. Also, would mean more \ncaution for hospital personnel. \nMay 8, 1991 office consultation by D. R. McNaught is out of chrono-\nlogical order here. He again performed a complete evaluation. He \nis tired of living with the complaints and being unable to sleep \nat night although severe pain does not appear to be his major pro-\nblem. The left calf is 1 cm smaller than the right. There is tend-\nPage four \nRe: Denis B. Ashcroft \nerness. Reflexes normal. Slight weakness dorsiflecion both great \ntoes. Reduced sensation bilaterally L-5 and in the calf and lat-\neral border of feet which is quite numb, extending into the fifth \ntoes of both feet. He reviewed the x-rays. He felt he did not \nhave severe sciatica but ongoing complaints presumably due to at \nleast significant bulging of lumbar discs primarily L-4,5 and per-\nhaps some at the L-S level. It is doubtful he is a surgical cand-\nidate but does not want to go on living with his present complaints. \nHe suggested possible epidural steroid injections if a new MRI is \nnormal. He also suggested the possibility of Chymopapain injection. \nAugust 9, 1991 he was seen in consultation by John M. Sanders, M.D. \nwho noted at the beginning his history seems to be fairly straight \nforward dating back to 1989 when he was unloading a truck and fur-\nther reviewed the history. Nothing has given him any sustained re-\nlief. He has nothing to gain financially from having a surgical \nprocedure done. I would have given the patient a 15% disability \nrating on the basis of his inability to return to his usual work. \nI think he got a 5% disability rating. (This clearly demonstrates \na wide spread problem - the lack of understanding of rating of per-\nmanent physical impairment in industrial cases.) \nHe performed straight leg raising reasonably well. Reflexes were \nnormal. Some sensory difference on alternate sides with difficulty \nknowing how to evaluate that. No atrophy. Motor power apparently \nnormal. He reviewed his films and does not see a surgical lesion. \nIn the lumbar region he has considerable fullness of the disc at \nL-3-4, 4-5 and L-5-S-1 but the nerve outlets seem to be satisfact-\nory. He was still concerned they may be missing some neurological \nproblem and he may see another neurologist or return to Dr. Moress. \nHe did note a possibility of Chymopapain injection and/or aspirat-\nion of the disc spaces because he doesn't have a focal lump of disc \nthat would be missed by those procedures. \"Those are procedures \nthat I have not been pleased with as I have seem them from this \npoint in time but some people have done them and in their hands \nhave reported good results so I' 11 leave that evaluation to you and \nsomeone else who sees him that might do those procedures) \nOctober 23, 1991 Dr. Sanders further reported that MRI didn't \nreally show what he considered to be a specific surgical lesion \nthough there are clearly some problems at multiple levels. None \nof them seem significant to warrant surgical intervention at the \npresent time. \nSPECIAL STUDIES: \n9-28-89 X-rays of the lumbar spine were interpreted by Dr. McGregor \nas normal. \n10-17-89 CT lumbar spine Dixie Medical Center disc bulging at three \nlevels with some decrease in AP diameter at L-3-4.

At L-3-4 there was mild impression of the anterior aspect \nof the thecal sac but no focal protrusion to suggest herniation \nand no encroachment of nerve roots. At L-4-5 there was disc degen-\neration vacuum phenomenon with no impingement. At L-5-S-1 there \nis disc space narrowing and degeneration and vacuum phenomenon. \nWith the bulging there is slight asymmetry to the right which en-\ncroaches on the right first sacral root slightly.

Ashcroft \nInternally disrupted discs with sizable posterior protrusions \nfrom L-3 through S-l. The L-4-5 and L-5-S-1 levels appear to \nbe the most significant. Never the less, typical reproduct-\nion of the patientfs usual leg pain was not achieved. The \npatient did have his typical back pain which, by his own \nadmission, is his least pain with injection at the L-4-5 \nlevel. \nDISCUSSION: \nThere are those individuals who seek interminably more and more \nmedical care as a solution to their problem. Medicine cannot solve \nall problems. Doctors cannot solve all problems. Surgery cannot \nsolve all problems. \nThis man does have significant multi-level cervical disc disease \nthat is not related to his industrial injury and is not being con-\nsidered for any possible surgical treatment and appears to be a \nrelatively minor portion of his symptom complex. \nMajor problem hinges on the lumbar area. \nIn your letter you suggest that the L-3-4 disc was the one that \nwas being considered for treatment but ray review of this case indic-\nates that the L-5-S-1 is the disc being singled out for treatment. \nThere is no question but what multiple studies have been performed \nwhich in general all agree with each other. There have been no \nspecific new revelations by any succeeding tests and these have \nbeen done because the patient has seen more and more doctors who \nfelt more and more tests should be required. If one continues to \nsee an unending string of doctors almost an unending therapy pro-\ngram will be prescribed and tests will be repeated over and over \nto ensure that something has not been missed. Once a person has \nseen two competent physicians it is almost never that any significant \npathology that is different is going to be uncovered by a third. \nThus repeated medical evaluations becomes a goal in itself in a \ndesperate search by the patient who is unable to say enough is \nenough and to accept the diagnosis, the prognosis, and more par-\nticularly accept his role as the patient. It appears that this \nperson has been unwilling to do this but he is looking for some \ndoctor to solve his problem. One hears of these rare and magical \ncases that are reported and continue to give all persons hope, \nbut this is not realistic. This man has had every benefit of \nmedical care and evaluation having been seen and evaluated and in \nsome instances treated by five specialists prior to seeing Dr. \nHunter. \nDr. Hunter has extensive experience in Chymopapain injections and \nwas, in fact, personally one of the very early persons to receive \nthis treatment and was gratified by the results. In general, \nafter extensive publicity the procedure has receded to where it \nis now seldom performed. Newer procedures such as percutaneous \ndiscectomy and suction discectomy have come along and they are be-\ning tried as well. Anything that is new is good and everybody \nJ T C L ^ ^ »3*5V*-.** \nRe: Denis B. Ashcroft \nwants the new thing whether it is proven to be as good or better \nthan the old thing or not. \nDr. Hunter is the only one of these five previous physicians who \nhas really had any kind of feeling that surgical treatment could \nactually be recommended though Dr. McNaught and Dr. Sanders did \nmention it as a possible consideration. I suspect that this was \nprimarily prompted by the encouragement or insistence of the pat-\nienlfc. I may not be properly characterizing their opinion regard-\ning Chemonucleolysis in this patient. Thus, I don't know if his \nreferral to Dr. Hunter was really initiated by his attending phy-\nsician's here or was more or less requested or demanded by the pat-\nient. \nDr. Hunter is the only one who found any reflex changes and he \nis the only one who has felt that there was any real surgical \nconclusion to be drawn from the sensory pattern that this man \ndemonstrates. If one goes all the way back to the time he was \nunder the care of Dr. Capel and reads the last few notes of Dr. \nCapel it still very clearly states this man's status and I don't \nbelieve that all of the other evaluations and studies have chang-\ned that. \nIt is difficult to delineate the level of his pain but I would \nsurmise that his fears regarding his physical condition have over-\nwhelmed him. That he may not be dealing well with his HIV status \nand that he may well be transferring his health care concerns to \nsomething that he can specifically identify in his back and hope \nthat some magic is going to significantly improve his condition. \nI am not sure how strongly Dr. Hunter feels about this surgical \ncondition and how strongly he is urging this because he states \n\"I think he now has a herniated disc at L-5-S-1 and advised that \nhe could be injected\" (emphasis added). This gives this reviewer \nmore of an impression that Dr. Hunter would be acquiescing in the \nwishes and desires of the patient more than he is actively pro-\nmoting this procedure himself. \nThere are two additional factors in this case. 11-25-90 the pat-\nient had a significant new episode. Prior to this it would appear \nthat he was getting along quite well and was definitely substanti-\nally worse following that episode. \n3-15-91 It was noted he was getting along reasonably well until \nMarch 14, 1991 when he bent down to clean manure and had sudden \npain in the low back and trouble standing up representing another \nfurther significant episode though not really associated with \nundue stress or strain. Thus, there are two significant episodes \nthathave continued to contribute to his problem subsequent to the \nindustrial accident though there was not shown to be any substant-\nial change in the specific diagnostic studies from the time before \nuntil the time after these two episodes. \nOne should additionally note the lack of specificity of the disco-\npage eigne \nRe: Denis B. Ashcroft \ngram as to the delineating the level of the problem to which \ntreatment should be directed. \nANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: \n1. No further additional, medical treatment is reasonable and nec-\nessary for Mr. Ashcroft as a direct result of the industrial event \nof September 25, 19 89. \n2. The proposed Chymopapain injection is not a reasonably necess-\nary medical treatment in light of Mr. Ashcroft1s overall medical \ncondition and more specifically in regards to these two specific \nfactors: \na. There is diffuse degenerative disc disease involving \nfour levels of his lumbar spine. \nb. Even the worst reading relative to the L-5-S-1 disc \ninterprets this as a rather benign protrusion or disc \nherniated that could not reasonably be expected to \ncompress the nerve roots on both sides. This would not \nexplain apparent weak dorsiflexion of the toes and sub-\njective paresthesia and would not appear to be sufficient \nto recommend or urge surgery. Dr. Hunter has based his \nconclusions regarding surgery a good deal on the absence \nof his right ankle reflex which appears to be a change \nsince his last prior examination by Dr. Sanders associat-\ned with limitation of straight leg raising and decrease \nsensation on the outer aspect of the right foot. \nIn view of the extensive studies and evaluations that this patient \nhas had it does not appear that more medical examinations or more \ndiagnostic studies will assist in the delineation or management \nof his problem. If one felt compelled to obtain additional evaluat-\nion to help clear the air then perhaps a re-evaluation by Dr. Mor-\ness who saw him some time ago and could review all of his subsequent \nradiographic studies if he felt it would be helpful in additon to \nthe reports. \n3. If Mr. Ashcroft undergoes the Chymopapain injection in any \nevent this is generally considered to be a rather benign operative \nprocedure with a low complication rate and a rather low morbidity \nrate but sometimes temporary total disability will continue beyond \nthree months and sometimes associated with rather severe muscle \nspasm and extended aggravation of symptoms. Frequently there is \nno improvement. The additional problem is that a multi-level disc \ndisease and the inability to be certain that one is attacking an \narea that is the primary cause of his pain in view of all of the \nstudies including the discography. Even \"good\" relief at this \nlevel may constitute very little improvement in the total picture. \nUnder no circumstances would a fusion be considered in view of his \nother medical conditions as well as the extensive nature of his \nlumbar spine disease. \nPage nine \nRe: Denis B. Ashcroft \nThere is increased surgical risks with Aids but a simple Chymopapain \ninjection would appear to carry minimal additional risks. \n4. Most of those who have examined this applicant have felt that \nhis neurological symptoms are primarily not related to a protruded \nor herniated intervertebral- disc and thus not specifically related \nto the alleged injury of 9-25-89. \nIf I can be of any further assistance in this complex matter please \ncontact me further. \nVery si|raerely, \nBoyd G.

Received 2011 April 29; in original form 2011 March 16\nABSTRACT\nUpcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID, and WFIRST, aim to mea-\nsure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. In order to fully exploit\nthese observations, models are needed that, given a set of cosmological parameters,\ncan predict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of 1% or better for\nscales corresponding to comoving wave numbers 0.1 . k . 10 hMpc−1. We have em-\nployed the large suite of simulations from the OWLS project to investigate the effects\nof various baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum. In addition, we have\nexamined the distribution of power over different mass components, the back-reaction\nof the baryons on the CDM, and the evolution of the dominant effects on the matter\npower spectrum. We find that single baryonic processes are capable of changing the\npower spectrum by up to several tens of per cent. Our simulation that includes AGN\nfeedback, which we consider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in\nprevious studies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduce\noptical and X-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease in power rel-\native to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z = 0, from 1% at k ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1\nto 10% at k ≈ 1 hMpc−1 and to 30% at k ≈ 10 hMpc−1. This contradicts the naive\nview that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominant effect only\nfor k & 70 hMpc−1. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback, cannot be\nignored in theoretical power spectra for k & 0.3 hMpc−1. It will thus be necessary\nto improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy formation, or at least\nto constrain them through auxiliary observations, before we can fulfil the goals of\nupcoming weak lensing surveys.\nKey words: Cosmology: theory, large-scale structure of Universe, galaxies: formation,\ngravitational lensing: weak, surveys\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the aims of cosmology is to find the initial conditions\nfor structure formation in the Universe. These can be char-\nacterised by a single set of cosmological parameters, which\ndirectly influence the formation, growth and clustering of\nstructure, and hence the distribution of matter as we ob-\nserve it today.\nA powerful measure of the statistical distribution of\nmatter (and a sufficient one for the case of Gaussian fluctu-\nations), is the matter power spectrum, P (k), where k is the\ncomoving wave number corresponding to a comoving spatial\nscale λ = 2π/k. Given a sufficiently accurate model for the\nformation of structure, we can infer the initial, linear power\n⋆ E-mail: daalen@strw.leidenuniv.nl\nspectrum from the observed, non-linear one. Moreover, as\nthe rate of growth of structure depends on the expansion\nhistory, such a model also allows us to convert observations\nof the evolution of the power spectrum into measurements of\nother cosmological parameters such as the equation of state\nof the dark energy.\nSome of the most accurate measurements of the mat-\nter power spectrum come from studies of weak, gravi-\ntational lensing (e.g. Massey et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2008;\nSchrabback et al. 2010), galaxy clustering (e.g. Cole et al.\n2005; Reid et al. 2010) and the Lyα forest (e.g. Viel et al.\n2004; McDonald et al. 2006). Up to a few years ago, the\nstatistical errors were sufficiently large that one could\nuse analytical predictions (always assuming, amongst other\nthings, that the Universe contains only dark matter), such\nas those by Peacock & Dodds (1996), Ma et al. (1999)\nc© 2011 RAS\n2 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nand Smith et al. (2003). The latter used ideas from the\n“halo model” (e.g. Peacock & Smith 2000; Seljak 2000;\nCooray & Sheth 2002) to improve upon the accuracy of sim-\npler analytical predictions. In recent years the further im-\nprovement of this model has become increasingly depen-\ndent on the results from N-body simulations, such as the\nderived concentration-mass relation for dark matter haloes\n(e.g. Neto et al. 2007; Duffy et al. 2008; Hilbert et al. 2009).\nIf baryonic effects were negligible, then these methods would\nallow the matter power spectrum to be predicted with\nan accuracy of ∼ 1% for wave numbers k . 1 hMpc−1\n(Heitmann et al. 2010). However, we will show here that\nbaryonic effects are larger than this on the scales relevant\nfor many observations.\nUpcoming weak lensing surveys aim to measure the\nmatter power spectrum on scales of 0.1 hMpc−1 < k <\n10 hMpc−1. In order to reach the level of precision their\ninstruments are capable of, surveys such as LSST,1 EU-\nCLID,2 and WFIRST3 need to be calibrated using the-\noretical models that retain 1% accuracies on these scales\n(Huterer & Takada 2005; Laureijs 2009).4 This is, however,\nnot as straightforward as increasing the resolution of exist-\ning N-body simulations: many authors have demonstrated\nthat on these scales baryonic matter, which is not ac-\ncounted for in currently employed theoretical models, intro-\nduces deviations of up to 10% (White 2004; Zhan & Knox\n2004; Jing et al. 2006; Rudd et al. 2008; Guillet et al. 2010;\nCasarini et al. 2011).\nRecent hydrodynamic simulations include many of the\nphysical processes associated with baryons, such as radiative\ncooling, star formation and supernova (SN) feedback. How-\never, the processes which cannot be resolved in simulations\nare generally also not entirely understood, and different pre-\nscriptions exist that aim to model the same physics. Because\nof this, different authors may find significantly different re-\nsults even when including the same baryonic processes. Fur-\nthermore, it is not a priori clear which physical effects are\ncapable of changing the matter power spectrum at the 1%\nlevel and should therefore be included. These modelling un-\ncertainties may thus prevent upcoming surveys from further\nconstraining the cosmological parameters of our Universe.\nHere we employ a large suite of state-of-the-art cosmo-\nlogical, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project\n(Schaye et al. 2010) to systematically study the effects of\nvarious baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum\nover a wide range of scales, k ∼ 0.1 − 500 hMpc−1. These\nprocesses include metal-line cooling, different prescriptions\nfor SN feedback, and feedback from active galactic nuclei\n(AGN). We will see that all of our results are heavily in-\nfluenced by the inclusion of AGN feedback, which was not\n1 http://www.lsst.org/lsst\n2 http://www.euclid-imaging.net/\n3 http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n4 Since cosmological parameters are inferred from cosmic shear\nusing a complicated weighting of the power spectrum over a range\nof scales and redshifts, the relation between the accuracy with\nwhich these parameters can be determined and the uncertainty\nin the models depends on the survey and is different for different\nparameters. Semboloni et al. (in preparation) will present a more\ndetailed study of the consequences of our findings for weak lensing\nsurveys.\nconsidered by earlier studies and which has been shown to\nsolve the overcooling problem that has long plagued hydro-\ndynamical simulations and to lead to an excellent match to\nboth the optical and X-ray properties of groups of galax-\nies (McCarthy et al. 2010, 2011). Outflows driven by AGN\nstrongly increase the scale out to which baryons modify the\npower spectrum. We also investigate how the power is dis-\ntributed over different components (i.e. CDM, gas and stars)\nand examine the back-reaction of the baryons on the dark\nmatter. In a follow-up paper (Semboloni et al., in prepa-\nration), we will quantify the implications for current and\nproposed weak lensing surveys and we will show how the\nuncertainty due to baryonic physics can be reduced by mak-\ning use of additional observations of groups and clusters.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In §2 we discuss the\nsimulations and the power spectrum estimator employed.\nIn our main results section, §3, we compare our dark mat-\nter only simulation to analytical estimates (§3.1), we com-\npare power spectra of simulations with different baryonic\nprocesses (§3.2), and we investigate how the power is dis-\ntributed over different physical components (§3.3). In this\nsection we also examine the back-reaction of galaxy forma-\ntion on the dark matter (§3.4) and we consider the evolution\nof the most dominant effects on the power spectrum (§3.5).\nWe compare to the results found by other authors in §4 and\nprovide a summary in §5. Finally, we test the convergence of\nour results in Appendix A and provide tables of the power\nspectra of all simulations in Appendix B.\nWe note that all distances quoted in this paper are co-\nmoving and all power spectra are obtained at redshift zero,\nunless stated otherwise.\n2 SIMULATIONS\nThe OWLS project (Schaye et al. 2010), where OWLS is\nan acronym for OverWhelmingly Large Simulations, is a\nsuite of large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations.\nThe code used is a heavily extended version of gadget iii, a\nLagrangian code which was last described in Springel (2005).\nIt uses a TreePM algorithm to efficiently calculate the grav-\nitational forces (where PM stands for Particle Mesh and the\n“Tree” describes the structure in which the particles are or-\nganised for this calculation, see for example Barnes & Hut\n1986; Xu 1995; Bagla 2002) and Smoothed Particle Hydro-\ndynamics (SPH) to follow and evolve the gas particles (see\nRosswog 2009 for a review).\nThere are two main sets of simulations, which have pe-\nriodic boxes of size L = 25 and 100 h−1 comoving Mpc on\na side, and are run down to redshifts z = 2 and 0, respec-\ntively. Most simulations use 5123 collisionless cold dark mat-\nter (CDM) particles and an equal number of baryonic (col-\nlisional gas or collisionless star) particles. We will refer to\nthe particle number used in a simulation with the parame-\nter N = N\n1/3\npart (= 512 for the high-resolution simulations).\nIn this work we will focus on z = 0 and hence on the sim-\nulations using a 100 h−1Mpc box. The particle masses are\n4.06×108 h−1M⊙[L/(100 h−1Mpc)]3[N/512]−3 for the dark\nmatter and 8.66×107 h−1M⊙[L/(100 h−1Mpc)]3[N/512]−3\nfor the baryons. The gravitational forces are softened on\na comoving scale of 1/25 of the initial mean interparticle\nspacing, L/N , but the softening length is limited to a max-\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 3\nimum physical scale of 2 h−1 kpc[L/(100 h−1Mpc)] which is\nreached at z = 2.91. The SPH calculations use 48 neigh-\nbours.\nFor the initial conditions, a theoretical matter power\nspectrum – which of course depends on the chosen set\nof cosmological parameters – is generated using cmbfast\n(Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996, version 4.1). Prior to imposing\nthe linear input spectrum, the particles are set up in an\ninitially glass-like state, as described in White (1994). The\nparticles are then evolved to redshift z = 127 using the\nZel’Dovich (1970) approximation.\nOn small scales, the physics of galaxy formation is un-\nresolved, and subgrid models are needed to include baryonic\neffects like radiative cooling, star formation and supernova\nfeedback. Although each OWLS run is a state-of-the-art cos-\nmological simulation in itself, the real power of the OWLS\nproject lies in the fact that it is composed of more than\n50 simulations that all incorporate different sets of physical\nprocesses, parameter values, or subgrid recipes. In this way\nthe effects of turning off or tweaking a single process can be\nstudied in detail, making it especially well-suited to investi-\ngate which processes can, by themselves, change the power\nat k ∼ 1 − 10 hMpc−1 by > 1%. In this paper we briefly\ndescribe the subgrid physics included in the reference simu-\nlation, as well as the differences with respect to simulations\nwe compare to in §3.2. For a more detailed treatment of the\nsimulations and the different physics models included, we\nrefer to Schaye et al. (2010).\n2.1 The reference simulation\nAs the intention of the OWLS project is to investigate the\neffects of altering or adding a single physical process, it is\nconvenient to have a single simulation that acts as the ba-\nsis for all other simulations. Such a “default” simulation\nshould of course include many of the physical processes that\nwe know to be important already, as ideally we would only\nwant to vary one thing at a time. We call this simulation\nthe reference simulation, or REF for short. Note that this\nis not intended to be the “best” simulation, but simply a\nmodel to build on. In fact, it has for example been shown\nthat AGN feedback, which was not included in the REF\nmodel and which we briefly discuss in the next section, is\nrequired to match observations of groups and clusters of\ngalaxies (McCarthy et al. 2010, 2011).\nWe assume cosmological parameter values derived from\nthe Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-\nyear results (Spergel et al. 2007): {Ωm, Ωb, ΩΛ, σ8, ns, h}\n= {0.238, 0.0418, 0.762, 0.74, 0.951, 0.73}. Except for σ8,\nall of these are consistent with the WMAP 7-year data\n(Komatsu et al. 2011). This specific parameter describes the\nroot mean square fluctuation in spheres with a radius of\n8h−1Mpc linearly extrapolated to z = 0 and effectively nor-\nmalises the matter power spectrum. Measurements in the\nlast few years have systematically increased the value of σ8,\nwhich may influence the validity of our results. To check the\neffects of using “wrong” values for this and other cosmo-\nlogical parameters, we have re-run our two most important\nsimulations – one with only dark matter and one in which\nAGN feedback is added to the reference model – using the\nWMAP7 cosmology. We briefly discuss these at the end of\nsection §2.2. As we shall see in §3.5, this change in cosmology\ndoes not affect our conclusions.\nThe reference simulation includes both radiative cool-\ning and heating, which are modelled using the prescription of\nWiersma et al. (2009). Net radiative cooling rates are com-\nputed on an element-by-element basis in the presence of\nthe cosmic microwave background and the Haardt & Madau\n(2001) model for the UV and X-ray background radiation\nfrom quasars and galaxies, taking into account the con-\ntributions of eleven different elements pre-computed using\nthe publicly available photo-ionization package CLOUDY,\nlast described by Ferland et al. (1998). The effects of\nhydrogen ionization are modelled by switching on the\nHaardt & Madau (2001) model at z = 9.\nCosmological simulations do not yet come close to re-\nsolving the process of star formation, and so a subgrid\nrecipe has to be included for this as well. In our simu-\nlations, gas particles can be converted into star particles\nonce their hydrogen number densities exceed the threshold\nfor thermo-gravitational instability (n∗H = 0.1 cm\n−3; Schaye\n2004). Cold gas particles with higher densities follow an im-\nposed equation of state, P ∝ ργeff . Here γeff = 4/3, for\nwhich Schaye & Dalla Vecchia (2008) showed that both the\nJeans mass and the ratio of the Jeans length to the SPH ker-\nnel are independent of the density, thus preventing spurious\nfragmentation due to a lack of numerical resolution. Using\ntheir pressure-dependent prescription for star formation, the\nobserved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a surface density scal-\ning law for the star formation rate that can be written as\nΣ˙∗ ∝ Σng (Kennicutt 1998), is reproduced by construction,\nindependent of the imposed equation of state.\nThe reference simulation assumes a Chabrier (2003)\nstellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) with low and high mass\ncut-offs at 0.1 and 100M⊙, respectively. The release of\nhydrogen, helium and heavier elements by these stars to\nthe surrounding gas is tracked as well: gas can be ejected\nthrough Type II SNe and stellar winds for massive stars,\nand Type Ia SNe and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nstars for intermediate mass stars. This implementation of\nstellar evolution and chemical enrichment is discussed in\nWiersma et al. (2009).\nFinally, the reference simulation includes a prescription\nfor supernova feedback, discussed in Dalla Vecchia & Schaye\n(2008). Supernovae are capable of depositing a significant\namount of energy in the surrounding gas, driving large-\nscale winds that may eject large amounts of gas, dramat-\nically suppressing the formation of stars. In the model used\nhere, the energy from SNe is injected into the gas kineti-\ncally. After a delay time of 30Myr, a new star particle j\nwill “kick” a neighbouring SPH particle i with a probabil-\nity ηmj/\n∑Nngb\ni=1 mi in a random direction, giving it an extra\nvelocity vw. The reference simulation uses the values η = 2\nfor the initial wind mass loading and vw = 600 kms\n−1 for\nthe initial wind velocity, which corresponds to 40% of the\navailable kinetic energy for our IMF.\n2.2 Other models\nThe OWLS project includes many variations on the refer-\nence simulation. We will now briefly discuss the simulations\nthat we compare to in §3.2. The different models are listed\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n4 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nTable 1. The different variations on the reference simulation that are compared in this paper. Unless noted otherwise, all simulations\nuse a set of cosmological parameters derived from the WMAP3 results and use identical initial conditions.\nSimulation Description\nAGN Includes AGN (in addition to SN feedback)\nAGN WMAP7 Same as AGN, but with a WMAP7 cosmology\nDBLIMFV1618 Top-heavy IMF at high pressure, extra SN energy in wind velocity\nDMONLY No baryons, cold dark matter only\nDMONLY WMAP7 Same as DMONLY, but with a WMAP7 cosmology\nMILL Millennium simulation cosmology (i.e. WMAP1), η = 4 (twice the SN energy of REF )\nNOSN No SN energy feedback\nNOSN NOZCOOL No SN energy feedback and cooling assumes primordial abundances\nNOZCOOL Cooling assumes primordial abundances\nWDENS Wind mass loading and velocity depend on gas density (SN energy as REF )\nWML1V848 Wind mass loading η = 1, velocity vw = 848 km s−1 (SN energy as REF )\nWML4 Wind mass loading η = 4 (twice the SN energy of REF )\nin Table 1. For more details and other models we again refer\nto Schaye et al. (2010).\nThe simulation DMONLY includes only dark matter,\nhence the only active physical process is gravity. This model\nis useful, as many (semi-)analytical models for the matter\npower spectrum assume that baryons are unimportant on\nlarge scales.\nThe NOSN simulation excludes supernova feedback,\nand the simulation NOZCOOL assumes primordial abun-\ndances when computing cooling rates. The simulation\nNOSN NOZCOOL excludes both SN feedback and metal-\nline cooling. Naturally, none of the three simulations can be\nconsidered realistic as we know that the omitted processes\nexist, but they are valuable tools to investigate on what\nscales and in what measure these processes affect the total\nmatter power spectrum. In fact, the same may be said for\nthe other models we consider as all, except for AGN, suf-\nfer from the overcooling problem and hence apparently miss\nan important process that does occur in nature (be it AGN\nfeedback or something else).\nSupernova feedback models suffer from large uncertain-\nties due to the limited resolution of the simulations and\na lack of observational constraints. Though the product of\nthe initial wind mass loading and the initial wind velocity\nsquared, ηv2w, determines the energy injected into the winds\nper unit stellar mass and is therefore limited from above by\nthe energy available from the SNe, the individual parameters\nare poorly constrained and can thus be varied. One varia-\ntion on the reference model that uses the same SN energy\nper unit stellar mass as REF is WML1V848, in which the\nwind mass loading is reduced by a factor of 2 while the wind\nvelocity is increased by a factor of\n√\n2. Another such vari-\nation is WDENS, in which the wind parameters scale with\nthe density of the gas from which the star particle formed:\nthe wind velocity as vw ∝ n1/6H , and the wind mass loading\nas η ∝ v−2w ∝ n−1/3H . Both parameters are equal to their\nfiducial values for stars formed at the density threshold for\nstar formation. For the polytropic EoS that we impose onto\nthe ISM, the wind velocity in this model scales with the lo-\ncal effective sound speed, as might be the case for thermally\ndriven winds.\nWe also compare to models where the SN energy is var-\nied. One scenario in which the SN energy may be higher\nthan that in the reference model is when, under certain cir-\ncumstances, the IMF becomes top-heavy, meaning that rela-\ntively more high-mass stars are produced. It is expected that\nthe IMF is top-heavy at high redshift and low metallicity\n(e.g. Larson 1998), and both observations and theory sug-\ngest that it may be top-heavy in extreme environments like\nthe galactic centre and starburst galaxies (e.g. Baugh et al.\n2005; Bartko et al. 2010). In the simulation DBLIMFV1618,\nthe latter effect is modelled by a switch from the Chabrier\nIMF to one that follows φ(m) ∝ m−1 once the gas reaches\na certain pressure threshold, which is set so that ∼ 10% of\nthe stellar mass forms with a top-heavy IMF. In this case,\nthe emissivity in ionizing photons goes up by a factor 7.3,\nand it is assumed that the SN energy scales up by the same\nfactor. In the model we consider here, this extra energy is\nused to raise the wind velocity by a factor\n√\n7.3.\nThe final model that we consider that only differs from\nREF in terms of its wind parameters is WML4, in which\nthe SN energy per unit stellar mass is doubled by simply\nincreasing the wind mass loading by a factor of two. The\nsame is done in the simulation MILL. However, the most\nimportant feature of the latter is that it uses the same val-\nues for the cosmological parameters as the Millennium sim-\nulation (Springel et al. 2005). These are derived from first-\nyear WMAP data and are given by: {Ωm,Ωb,ΩΛ, σ8, ns, h}\n= {0.25, 0.045, 0.75, 0.9, 1.0, 0.73}.\nThe last and, for our purposes, most important physics\nvariation we consider here adds a phenomenon that has\nproved to be increasingly necessary to reconcile theory and\nobservations, from the scales of individual galaxies to clus-\nters: Active Galactic Nuclei, or AGN. They are caused by\nthe emission of large amounts of energy from the accret-\ning supermassive black holes that reside at the centres of\ngalaxies, in the form of radiation that may couple to the\ngas and relativistic jets caused by the magnetic field of the\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 5\ninfalling material, which can heat and displace gas out to\nvery large distances. AGN have been invoked to explain, for\nexample, the low star formation rates of high-mass galaxies\nand the suppression of cooling flows in clusters. Moreover,\nLevine & Gnedin (2006) have used a toy model to demon-\nstrate that AGN feedback may provide sufficient energy to\nhave a large effect on the matter power spectrum.\nWe model the growth of supermassive black holes and\nthe associated feedback processes using the prescription de-\ntailed in Booth & Schaye (2009), which is an extension of\nthat by Springel et al. (2005). During the simulation, a black\nhole seed particle with mass mseed = 9 × 104 h−1M⊙ (i.e.\n10−3mbaryon) is placed at the centre of every dark mat-\nter halo whose mass exceeds mhalo,min = 4 × 1010 h−1M⊙\n(corresponding to 102 dark matter particles). These parti-\ncles then accumulate mass from the surrounding gas at an\n(Eddington-limited) rate based on Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\naccretion (Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939),\nbut scaled up by a factor α to account for the lack of a\ncold gas phase and the finite numerical resolution. However,\nfor densities below our star formation threshold we do not\nexpect a cold phase to be present and we therefore set α\nequal to unity. To ensure a smooth transition, α is made to\ndepend on the density of the gas:\nα =\n{\n1 if nH < n\n∗\nH(\nnH\nn∗\nH\n)β\notherwise.\n(1)\nHere the density threshold n∗H is the critical value required\nfor the formation of a cold interstellar gas phase (n∗H =\n0.1 cm−3; see §2.1). Models of this type are called ‘constant-\nβ models’, and the fiducial value β = 2 is used throughout\nthis paper.\nThe black holes inject 1.5 per cent of the rest mass en-\nergy of the accreted gas into the surrounding matter in the\nform of heat. This feedback efficiency determines the nor-\nmalisation, but not the slope, of the relations between black\nhole mass and galaxy properties. Booth & Schaye (2009)\nand Booth & Schaye (2011) demonstrate that this efficiency\nreproduces the observed relations between BH mass and\nboth stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion, as well as\ntheir evolution. McCarthy et al. (2010) have shown that the\nAGN simulation, but not the reference model, provides ex-\ncellent agreement with both optical and X-ray observables\nof groups of galaxies at redshift zero. In particular, it repro-\nduces the temperature, entropy, and metallicity profiles of\nthe gas, the stellar masses, star formation rates, and age dis-\ntributions of the central galaxies, and the relations between\nX-ray luminosity and both temperature and mass. We there-\nfore consider simulation AGN to be more realistic than our\nother models. As we shall see in §3, the inclusion of AGN\nfeedback greatly affects the power spectrum on a large range\nof scales.\nFinally, we have re-run two simulations, DMONLY\nand AGN, with cosmological parameters derived from the\nWMAP 7-year results (Komatsu et al. 2011): {Ωm, Ωb, ΩΛ,\nσ8, ns, h} = {0.272, 0.0455, 0.728, 0.81, 0.967, 0.704}. These\nversions are called DMONLY WMAP7 and AGN WMAP7,\nrespectively. We consider the latter to be our most realis-\ntic and up-to-date model. Note that the linear input power\nspectra used for the initial conditions of these simulations\nhave not been generated by cmbfast, but by the more up-\nto-date f90 package camb (Lewis & Challinor 2002, version\nJanuary 2010).\n2.3 Power spectrum calculation\nThe distribution of matter in the Universe can be described\nby a continuous density function, ρ(x), where the vector x\nspecifies the position relative to some arbitrary origin. Given\nthis density field, we consider fluctuations, δ(x), defined as:\nδ(x) ≡ ρ(x)− ρ¯\nρ¯\n, (2)\nwhere ρ¯ is the global mean density. We can relate this density\ncontrast to wave modes δˆk via a discrete Fourier transform:\nδ(x) =\n∑\nk\nδˆk e\n−ik·x. (3)\nThe density field can thus be seen as made up of waves with\ncertain amplitudes and phases, with wave vectors k. We now\ndefine the power spectrum, P (k), as:\nP (k) ≡ V\n〈\n|δˆk|2\n〉\nk\n, (4)\nwhere V is the volume under consideration. The power spec-\ntrum is therefore obtained by collecting the amplitudes-\nsquared of all wave modes with the same wave number\nk = |k|, and averaging them. This makes it clear that the\npower spectrum is a statistical tool, whose accuracy in-\ncreases when more waves of the same length are available\n(i.e. when the scale 2π/k is small compared to the size of\nthe box). We will present our results using what is often\ncalled the dimensionless matter power spectrum, which is\ndefined as:\n∆2(k) =\nk3\n2π2\nP (k). (5)\nThe dimensionless power spectrum scales with the mass vari-\nance, σ2(M), where M = 4π\n3\n(\n2π\nk\n)3\nρ¯. Note that using ∆2(k)\ninstead of P (k) does not affect the relative differences be-\ntween power spectra.\nThe code we have chosen to use to obtain accurate\npower spectrum estimations from our simulations is the pub-\nlicly available f90 package called powmes (Colombi et al.\n2009). The advantages of powmes stem from the use of the\nFourier-Taylor transform, which allows analytical control of\nthe biases introduced, and the use of foldings of the particle\ndistribution, which allow the dynamic range to be extended\nto arbitrarily high wave numbers while keeping the statisti-\ncal errors bounded. For a full description of these methods\nwe refer to Colombi et al. (2009). We have compared the\nperformance of powmes with respect to power spectrum\nestimators using simple NGP, CIC and TSC interpolation\nschemes, and found that powmes is capable of obtaining\nfar more accurate power spectra over a larger spectral range\nwithin the same computation time.\nWe have expanded powmes with the possibility to con-\nsider only one group of particles at a time, in order to see\nwhich parts of the power spectrum are dominated by the\ncontribution of, for example, cold dark matter (see §3.3).\nFinally, we performed extensive timing tests using different\ngrids, foldings, CPUs and particle numbers which, combined\nwith the performance results from Colombi et al. (2009), re-\nsulted in the fiducial values G = 256 and F = 7 for the\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n6 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nnumber of grid points on a side and the number of foldings,\nrespectively.\n2.3.1 Discreteness and other numerical limitations\nIn Appendix A we demonstrate that the simulations are suf-\nficiently converged with respect to increases in the numerical\nresolution to predict the power spectrum with better than\n1% accuracy for k . 10hMpc−1. This range is greatly ex-\npanded in both directions if we only consider the relative\ndifferences in power between simulations.\nBesides numerical resolution, the predicted power spec-\ntra may be affected by sample variance, which is generally\ncalled cosmic variance in cosmology. This is caused by the\nfinite volume of the box and by the fact that each simulation\nprovides only a single realisation of the underlying statisti-\ncal distribution. Note that finite volume effects are different\nfor the simulations than for observational surveys, because\nthe mean density in the simulation boxes is always equal to\nthe cosmic mean. In Appendix A we show that finite volume\neffects may cause us to underestimate the effects of baryons\non scales of several tens of Mpc, i.e. close to the size of the\nbox. While the fact that we only use a single realisation of\nthe initial conditions prevents us from obtaining highly ac-\ncurate absolute values for the power spectrum on scales close\nto the box size, it does not prevent us from investigating the\nrelative changes in power caused by baryon physics.\nFinally, we are limited in our determination of the power\nspectrum by the discreteness of the density field. Because we\nuse particles to represent a continuous field, there will always\nbe non-zero power present at all scales, called white noise\nor shot noise. If we assume the particle distribution to be\na local Poisson realisation of a stationary random field, an\nassumption used in any calculation of the power spectrum\nand one that is expected to be valid for an evolved distri-\nbution,5 this white noise component can be calculated (see,\nfor example, Peebles 1980, 1993; Colombi et al. 2009). Sub-\ntracting the shot noise from the initial estimate of the power\nspectrum will make the latter somewhat more accurate, but\none should still expect the uncertainty on the estimate of the\npower spectrum to increase dramatically when the intrinsic\npower spectrum falls far below the shot noise level. The con-\ntribution of shot noise to P (k) is independent of k. Hence,\nif we use ∆2(k) as the measure of the power spectrum, then\nthe shot noise level will scale as k3. In the following sec-\ntion, the scale at which the shot noise of each simulation is\nequal to (the white noise corrected) ∆2(k) is denoted by a\ncircle, while it is shown explicitly in Appendix A. Note that\nthe theoretical shot noise level has been subtracted for all\npower spectra shown in this paper.\n3 RESULTS\nIn this section we present the power spectra obtained from\nour simulations. In §3.1 we compare the power spectrum\n5 The discreteness noise can initially be much smaller if the par-\nticles are arranged on a grid or in a “glass-like” fashion. Particles\nin low-density regions may retain memory of their initial distri-\nbution, reducing the noise below the level expected for a Poisson\ndistribution.\nFigure 1.

The\nbottom panel shows the ratios of the power spectra from theoret-\nical models and the simulation. There is good agreement down\nto scales of a few Mpc, especially for the more recent HALOFIT\nmodel, but on smaller scales DMONLY predicts up to twice as\nmuch power as HALOFIT. For λ < 102 h−1 kpc the power in the\nDMONLY simulation drops due to a lack of resolution.\nof our dark matter only simulation to predictions from the\nliterature. We investigate the effects of adding or modify-\ning prescriptions for baryonic processes in §3.2. We examine\nhow well CDM, gas, and stars trace each other and con-\nsider the contributions of these different components to the\ntotal power in the reference simulation in §3.3, and we ex-\namine the back-reaction of baryons on the CDM for the two\nmost important simulations, REF and AGN, in §3.4. Fi-\nnally, in §3.5, we take a closer look at model AGN, which\nwe consider to be our most realistic simulation because it\nreproduces the optical and X-ray observations of groups of\ngalaxies (McCarthy et al. 2010). We investigate the effect\nof using the WMAP7 rather than the WMAP3 cosmology,\ncompare to widely used model power spectra, and consider\nthe evolution of the effect of baryons on the matter power\nspectrum.\n3.1 Comparison of a dark matter only simulation\nto models\nIn this section we compare the power spectrum of our\nDMONLY simulation to those predicted by the widely used\nmodels of Peacock & Dodds (1996, hereafter PD96) and\nSmith et al. (2003, hereafter HALOFIT).\nThe PD96 model is an extension of what is known as the\nHKLM model (Hamilton et al. 1991), which first introduced\na universal analytical formula to map the linear correlation\nfunction into a non-linear one, the coefficients of which were\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 7\nestimated using N-body simulations. Both of these models\nassume spherical collapse of fluctuations that have reached\na certain overdensity, followed by stable clustering (which\nstates that the mean physical separation of particles is con-\nstant on sufficiently small scales). Peacock & Dodds (1994),\nfollowed by PD96, expanded on the groundwork laid by\nHKLM by presenting a version of the method that worked\nwith power spectra instead and allowed for Ω 6= 1, a non-zero\ncosmological constant and large negative spectral indices.\nHowever, numerical simulations have shown that the as-\nsumption of stable clustering is not always valid. The more\nrecent HALOFIT model by Smith et al. (2003) aimed to im-\nprove on PD96 by taking this into account. This method is\nbased on concepts from the “halo model”, in which the den-\nsity field is viewed as a distribution of isolated haloes (e.g.\nPeacock & Smith 2000; Seljak 2000; Cooray & Sheth 2002).\nIt is then assumed that the power spectrum can be split into\ntwo parts: a large-scale quasi-linear term that is due to the\nclustering of separate haloes (the 2-halo term), and a small-\nscale term caused by the correlation of subhaloes within the\nsame parent halo (the 1-halo term). Their resulting analyti-\ncal formulae were fit to power spectra obtained from N-body\nsimulations.\nTo create power spectra that conform with these mod-\nels and the cosmological parameters used in our simulations,\nwe have utilised the publicly available package iCosmo, de-\nscribed in Refregier et al. (2008). We chose to generate the\nlinear power spectra using the Eisenstein & Hu (1999, EH)\ntransfer function. We have also tried using the Bardeen et al.\n(1986, BBKS) transfer function to generate initial conditions\nfor the PD96 model, as this is the one originally used by the\nauthors, which introduced only minor differences with re-\nspect to the results shown here (1 − 10% lower power for\nk & 10hMpc−1).\nIn Figure 1 we compare these models to the simula-\ntion that, like the theoretical models for non-linear growth,\nincludes only dark matter (DMONLY ). For reference, the\ndashed curve shows the linear input power spectrum of the\nsimulations. The bottom panel shows the ratio of the ana-\nlytical predictions to our results. Note that we have omit-\nted the first wave mode (at λ = 100 h−1Mpc) in all of our\nfigures because we cannot sample the power spectrum on\nthe scale of the simulation box. We see that the dark mat-\nter power spectrum follows the analytical predictions pretty\nwell on large scales (except on the scale of the simulation\nbox), and that HALOFIT provides a better match than the\nPD96 model, as expected. However, on scales below a few\nMpc the theoretical models start to severely underestimate\nthe amount of structure formed in the simulation, and the\ndifference between HALOFIT and the DMONLY simula-\ntion reaches a factor of 2 on scales of 1− 3× 10−1 h−1Mpc.\nThe rapid decline of the DMONLY power spectrum for\nk & 100 hMpc−1 (λ < 102 h−1 kpc) is mostly due to the\nunderproduction of low-mass haloes due to the finite resolu-\ntion (see Appendix A). While we will always show the power\nspectrum up to k ≈ 500 hMpc−1, we are mainly interested\nin the scales relevant for upcoming surveys, k . 10hMpc−1.\nAs discussed in Appendix A, for k ≫ 10 hMpc−1 numerical\nconvergence may become an issue. Note that the power spec-\ntrum of the simulation remains reasonably well-behaved far\nbelow the theoretical shot noise level (i.e. well to the right\nFigure 2.

These mod-\nels improve on the HALOFIT model by including a vari-\nable concentration-mass relation (such as those derived by\nNeto et al. 2007; Duffy et al. 2008) and have been shown to\nreproduce the power spectra from simulations with higher\naccuracy (e.g. Hilbert et al. 2009). Since no suitable codes\nemploying these models were available, we do not compare\nto their results here. However, as Hilbert et al. (2009) have\nshown that using the halo model with the concentration-\nmass relation of Neto et al. (2007) increases the power at\nintermediate scales, we suspect that such models would pro-\nvide a better match to the power spectrum of DMONLY.\n3.2 The relative effects of different baryonic\nprocesses\nIn this section we present our main results, demonstrating\nhow single baryonic processes, or implementations thereof,\ncan influence the matter power spectrum. While we will fo-\ncus mainly on the range of scales relevant to upcoming weak\nlensing surveys, 0.1 hMpc−1 < k < 10hMpc−1, we will also\ndiscuss the differences at the much smaller scales that our\nsimulations allow us to probe. We note again that all power\nspectra are taken from simulations with L = 100 h−1Mpc\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n8 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nand N = 512 at redshift zero, and that, unless stated other-\nwise, all simulations are evolved from the same initial con-\nditions.\nWe start by comparing the power spectra of DMONLY,\nthe reference simulation (REF ) and AGN, in Figure 2. The\npanel at the bottom of most plots in this section shows\nthe absolute value of the relative difference between power\nspectra. The dotted, horizontal line shows the 1% level: any\ndifferences above this level will thus affect the statistics of\nsurveys that aim to measure the power spectrum to this\naccuracy.\nIt is immediately clear from the comparison between\nDMONLY and REF that the contribution of the baryons\nis significant, decreasing the power by more than 1% for\nk ≈ 0.8 − 5hMpc−1. This is because gas pressure smooths\nthe density field relative to that expected from dark matter\nalone. On scales smaller than 1 h−1Mpc (k & 6hMpc−1),\nthe power in the reference simulation quickly rises far above\nthat of the dark matter only simulation, because radiative\ncooling enables gas to cluster on smaller scales than the dark\nmatter. These results confirm the findings of previous stud-\nies, at least qualitatively (e.g. Jing et al. 2006; Rudd et al.\n2008; Guillet et al. 2010; Casarini et al. 2011).\nHowever, when AGN feedback is included, the results\nchange drastically. In this case, the reduction in power rel-\native to DMONLY already reaches 1% for k ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1\n(λ ≈ 20 h−1Mpc) and exceeds 10% for 2 . k . 50hMpc−1.\nWe thus see that AGN feedback even suppresses the to-\ntal matter power spectrum on very large scales. The enor-\nmous effect of AGN feedback is due to the removal of gas\nfrom (groups of) galaxies. That large amounts of gas are in-\ndeed being moved to large radii in this simulation has been\nshown by, for example, Duffy et al. (2010, e.g. Figures 1 &\n2) and McCarthy et al. (2011, e.g. Figure 3). Because the\nAGN reside in massive and thus strongly clustered objects,\nthe power is suppressed out to scales that exceed the scale\non which individual objects move the gas.\nFigure 3 shows the difference in the power spectra pre-\ndicted by a variety of simulations relative to that predicted\nby the reference simulation. The models are listed in Table 1\nand were described in §2.2. The top panel shows the effect\nof turning off SN feedback and/or metal-line cooling. Since\nSN feedback heats and ejects gas, we expect it to decrease\nthe small-scale power. Indeed, the power in NOSN is > 1%\nhigher than in the reference simulation for k > 4 hMpc−1\nand the difference reaches 10% at k ≈ 10hMpc−1. The ab-\nsence of SN feedback also increases the star formation rate,\nmaking stars the dominant contributor to the total matter\npower spectrum out to larger scales (not shown).\nTurning off metal-line cooling reduces the power on\nsmall scales because less gas is able to cool down and accrete\nonto galaxies. Indeed, model NOZCOOL predicts 10− 50%\nless power for k & 30 hMpc−1. However, the absence of\nmetal-line cooling increases the power by several percent for\nλ ∼ 1h−1Mpc because the lower cooling rates force more\ngas to remain at large distances from the halo centres.\nEven though the effects of SN feedback and metal-line\ncooling are somewhat opposite in nature, as the former in-\ncreases the energy of the gas while the latter allows the gas to\nradiate more of its thermal energy away, removing both pro-\ncesses in the simulation NOSN NOZCOOL still introduces\ndifferences of about 1 − 10% for k & 2 hMpc−1 relative to\nFigure 3. Comparisons of z = 0 power spectra predicted by simu-\nlations incorporating different physical processes to that predicted\nby the reference simulation. The panels are similar to the bottom\npanel of Figure 2, but now show differences relative to REF. The\nthin black curve that is repeated in all panels shows the relative\ndifference with DMONLY. Colours indicate different simulations,\nwhile different line styles indicate whether the power is reduced\nor increased relative to the reference simulation.\nTop: A simulation without SN feedback (blue), one without\nmetal-line cooling (green) and one that excludes both effects\n(red). SN feedback decreases the power on all scales. Metal-line\ncooling decreases the power for λ > 0.4h−1Mpc but increases the\npower on smaller scales. The effects of removing both SN feed-\nback and metal-line cooling are > 10% for k > 20 hMpc−1 and\n> 1% for k > 2hMpc−1.\nMiddle: Different SN wind models which all use the same amount\nof SN energy per unit stellar mass (see text). The effects of vary-\ning the implementation of SN feedback, while keeping the SN\nenergy that is injected per unit stellar mass the same, are > 10%\nfor k > 10 hMpc−1 and > 1% for k > 1hMpc−1.\nBottom: Models with different feedback energies and processes,\nsee text for details. Including a top-heavy IMF at high pres-\nsure (DBLIMFV1618 ) or AGN feedback (AGN ) greatly reduces\nthe power. The reduction caused by the latter is > 10% for\nk > 2hMpc−1 and > 1% for k > 0.4hMpc−1.\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 9\nFigure 4.

WML4 is shown\nfor reference as this simulation uses the same baryonic physics as\nMILL. For k & 3hMpc−1, the effect of AGN feedback is at least\nas strong as that of this unrealistically large change in cosmology.\nthe reference simulation. It is therefore vital to take both SN\nfeedback and metal-line cooling into account if one wants to\npredict the matter power spectrum with an accuracy better\nthan 10%.\nWe compare models that use different prescriptions for\nSN feedback, but the same amount of SN energy per unit\nstellar mass as REF, in the middle panel of Figure 3. In\nWML1V848 the SN energy is distributed over half as much\ngas, but the initial wind velocity is a factor\n√\n2 higher, re-\nsulting in more effective SN feedback in all but the low-\nest mass galaxies. The differences with respect to the ref-\nerence model extend to even larger scales than when SN\nfeedback is removed entirely: the power is reduced by > 1%\nfor k & 1hMpc−1 and by & 10% for k & 10hMpc−1. In\nmodel WDENS the initial wind velocity increases with the\nlocal sound speed in the ISM, but the mass loading is ad-\njusted so as to keep the amount of SN energy per unit stellar\nmass equal to that in REF. This implementation results in\nan even stronger decrease in power on scales < 10h−1Mpc.\nIn both these models, the reduction in power is caused by\nthe increased effectiveness of SN feedback in driving outflows\nof gas. We stress that because of our lack of understanding\nof the effects of SN feedback, there is a priori no reason to\nassume that the model used in the reference simulation is a\nbetter approximation to reality than the models we compare\nto here.\nIn fact, it is possible that the SN energy per unit stellar\nmass is different from the value assumed in the REF model,\nor that it varies with environment. Model DBLIMFV1618,\nwhich we compare with REF in the bottom panel of Fig-\nure 3, uses a top-heavy IMF in high-pressure environments.\nSuch an IMF yields more SNe per unit stellar mass which\ndecreases the power by > 1% for k > 0.7 hMpc−1 and by\n> 10% for k > 4hMpc−1. Clearly, it will be necessary to\nunderstand any environmental dependence of the IMF in or-\nder to predict the matter power spectrum to 1% accuracy\non the scales relevant for upcoming surveys.\nOn the other hand, doubling the wind mass loading,\nwhile keeping the wind velocity fixed to the value used in\nREF, as is done in WML4, has a far more modest effect.\nThis is because the wind velocities are too low to signif-\nicantly disturb the high-pressure ISM of massive galaxies.\nThe differences with respect to the reference model are lim-\nited to . 1% for k . 10 hMpc−1.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 3 also compares the ref-\nerence simulation to model AGN, which differs from REF\nby the inclusion of a phenomenon that has been shown\nto play a role in many contexts and that strongly im-\nproves the agreement with observations of groups of galaxies\n(McCarthy et al. 2010). Like SN feedback, AGN feedback\ndecreases the power by heating and ejecting gas, but the\neffect is more dramatic than that of the standard SN feed-\nback model, both in scope and magnitude. With respect to\nthe reference model, the power is decreased by & 30% for\nk > 10 hMpc−1 and by & 5% for k > 1hMpc−1. The re-\nduction in power only falls below 1% for k < 0.4 hMpc−1\n(λ & 10 h−1Mpc). Note that the effect of AGN feedback is\nstrikingly similar to, albeit stronger than, that of the stellar\nfeedback model that uses a top-heavy IMF in high-pressure\nenvironments.\nIt is clear that many different baryonic processes, and\neven slightly different implementations thereof, are capable\nof introducing significant differences in the matter power\nspectrum on scales relevant for observational cosmology. To\nput the effects of baryons into perspective, we compare to\na simulation with a very different cosmology, MILL, in Fig-\nure 4. The difference between the cosmology derived from\nthe first-year WMAP data used inMILL and the one derived\nfrom the 3-year WMAP data used in the other simulations\nis large; in fact, the difference is much larger than the er-\nror bars of the most recent data allow. For reference, we\nnote that the currently favoured cosmology (Komatsu et al.\n2011) lies in between those given by WMAP1 and WMAP3.\nTo account for the difference in normalisation of the MILL\npower spectrum, which is caused mainly by its higher Ωm\nand σ8 values, we have rescaled it to have the same power at\nthe box size as REF. Still, the effect on the power spectrum\nexceeds 10% for k & 0.2hMpc−1. A quick comparison with\nWML4, which uses the exact same baryon physics as MILL\nand twice the SN wind mass loading used in REF, shows\nthat the effect of the change in mass loading is relatively\nsmall, as we had already shown in Figure 3. However, we\nsee that for k & 3hMpc−1, the effect of AGN feedback is at\nleast as strong as that of this unrealistically large change in\ncosmology. We thus conclude that baryonic effects are not\nonly significant at the ∼ 1% level, but can even be larger\nthan a “very wrong” choice of cosmology.\nAlmost all theoretical models used in the literature con-\nsider only CDM, assuming that the baryons follow the dark\nmatter perfectly for k . 1hMpc−1. We have shown (see\nFig. 2) that the fact that baryons experience gas pressure\nreduces the power on large scales, while their ability to radi-\nate away their thermal energy increases the power on small\nscales. If we ignore AGN feedback, as has been done in\nall previous work, we find that the power is reduced by at\nleast a few percent for 0.8 < k < 5 hMpc−1 and that the\npower is increased for k > 7hMpc−1, with the difference\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n10 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nFigure 6. The back-reaction of baryons on the CDM. The blue\ncurves show the relative difference between the power spectrum\nof the CDM component, after scaling the CDM density by the\nfactor Ωm/(Ωm − Ωb), and that of a dark matter only simu-\nlation for either the REF (top panel) or AGN (bottom panel)\nmodel. For comparison, the relative differences between the total\nmatter power spectra of the baryonic simulations and DMONLY\nis shown by the black curves. Baryons increase the small-scale\npower in the CDM component. However, when AGN feedback is\nincluded, the power in the CDM component drops 1 − 10% be-\nlow that of the DMONLY simulations for 0.2h−1Mpc . λ .\n2h−1Mpc.\nreaching approximately 6% at k = 10 hMpc−1 for the refer-\nence model. However, the single process of AGN feedback,\nwhich improves the agreement with observations of groups of\ngalaxies, reduces the power by & 10% over the whole range\n1 . k . 10 hMpc−1 and the reduction only drops below 1%\nfor k < 0.3 hMpc−1. Highly efficient SN feedback, as may for\nexample result from a top-heavy IMF in starbursts, would\nhave nearly as large an effect. One can therefore not expect\nto constrain the primordial power spectrum more accurately\nuntil such processes are better understood and included in\ntheoretical models.\n3.3 Contributions of dark matter, gas and stars\nGenerally, power spectra are calculated using all matter in-\nside the computational volume. This total matter power\nspectrum is what is measurable using e.g. gravitational lens-\ning surveys. However, as we have a larger freedom of mea-\nsurement using simulations, we can also consider the power\nin different components, for example to see which parts of\nthe power spectrum are dominated by baryonic matter or\nhow baryons change the distribution of cold dark matter.\nOn sufficiently large scales the baryons will trace the\ndark matter. Hence, when averaged over these scales, the\nbaryonic and CDM densities are given by\nρcdm =\nΩm − Ωb\nΩm\nρtot,\nρbar =\nΩb\nΩm\nρtot. (6)\nWe can now use these expressions to estimate the relative\ncontributions of correlations between particle types to the\ntotal matter power spectrum. Using Ptot(k) ∝\n〈|ρˆtot(k)|2〉 ∝〈|ρˆcdm|2〉+ 〈ρˆcdmρˆ∗bar〉 + 〈ρˆ∗cdmρˆbar〉 + 〈|ρˆbar|2〉, we find, for\nsufficiently small k:\nPcc =\n(Ωm − Ωb)2\nΩ2m\nPtot ≈ 0.68Ptot,\nPcb + Pbc =\n2Ωb(Ωm − Ωb)\nΩ2m\nPtot ≈ 0.29Ptot, (7)\nPbb =\nΩ2b\nΩ2m\nPtot ≈ 0.03Ptot .\nHence, on large scales we expect the power due to the auto-\ncorrelation of CDM to dominate the total matter power\nspectrum, with a significant contribution from the cross\nterms Pcb and Pbc.\nThe four panels of Figure 5 show power spectra for the\nREF L100N512 (left) and AGN L100N512 (right) simula-\ntion at z = 0, both for the total matter (solid black) and\nfor individual components (coloured curves). For reference,\nwe also show the power spectrum for DMONLY L100N512\n(dashed black). The top row shows the power spectra of\nδi ≡ (ρi − ρ¯i)/ρ¯i. This definition ensures that the power\nspectra of all components i converge on large scales, which\nallows us to examine how well different components trace\neach other. The bottom row, on the other hand, shows the\npower spectra of δ′i ≡ (ρi − ρ¯tot)/ρ¯tot, which allows us to\nestimate the contributions of different components to the\ntotal matter power spectrum.\nLooking at the top-left panel, we see that, as expected,\nthe baryonic components trace the dark matter well at\nthe largest scales. However, significant differences exist for\nλ . 10 h−1Mpc. Observe that, at scales of several hundred\nkpc and smaller, the difference between REF and the dark\nmatter only simulation is larger than that between the lat-\nter and the analytical models we compared to earlier (see\nFig. 1). In fact, the difference between the cold dark matter\ncomponent of the reference simulation and DMONLY is also\nlarger than that between the latter and the analytic models.\nThis is due to the back-reaction of the baryons on the dark\nmatter, which we will discuss in §3.4.\nNext, we turn to the bottom-left panel of Figure 5 which\nshows that cold dark matter dominates the power spectrum\non large scales, as expected, although the contribution from\nthe CDM-baryon cross power spectrum (not shown) is im-\nportant as well. The contribution of baryons is significant\nfor λ . 102 h−1 kpc and dominates below 60 h−1 kpc. The\nstrong small-scale baryonic clustering is the direct conse-\nquence of gas cooling and galaxy formation. Taking a look\nat how the baryonic component is itself built up, we see\nthat gas dominates the baryonic power spectrum on large\nscales, but that stars take over for λ < 1 h−1Mpc. The gas\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 11\nFigure 5. Decomposing the z = 0 total power spectra (black) into the contributions from cold dark matter (blue), gas (green) and\nstars/black holes (red). The left and right columns show results for REF L100N512 and AGN L100N512. In the top row the density\ncontrast of each component i is defined relative to its own mean density, i.e. δi ≡ (ρi − ρ¯i)/ρ¯i. This guarantees that all power spectra\nconverge on large scales, thus enabling a straightforward comparison of their shapes. In the bottom row the density contrast of each\ncomponent is defined relative to the total mean density, i.e. δi ≡ (ρi − ρ¯tot)/ρ¯tot, which allows one to compare their contributions to the\ntotal power. The power spectrum of the gas flattens or even decreases for λ . 1h−1Mpc as a result of pressure smoothing, but its ability\nto cool allows it to increase again on galaxy scales (λ . 102 h−1 kpc). The power spectrum of the stellar component, which is a product\nof the collapse of cooling gas, increases most rapidly towards smaller scales. While stars dominate the total power for λ ≪ 102 h−1 kpc\nin REF, dark matter dominates on all scales when AGN feedback is included.\npower spectrum flattens for λ . 1h−1Mpc, which corre-\nsponds to the virial radii of groups of galaxies, but steepens\nagain for λ . 0.1 h−1Mpc, i.e. galaxy scales. The reason for\nthe decrease in slope around 1h−1Mpc is threefold. First,\nthe pressure of the hot gas smooths its distribution on the\nscales of groups and clusters of galaxies. Second, as the gas\ncollapses it fragments and forms stars. Third, due to stel-\nlar feedback the gas is distributed out to large distances,\nreducing the power.\nThe inclusion of AGN feedback greatly impacts the\nmatter power spectrum on a wide range of scales. Compar-\ning the top panels of Figure 5, we see that AGN feedback\nstrongly decreases the power in the gas and stellar compo-\nnents relative to that of the dark matter for λ . 1h−1Mpc.\nA comparison of the bottom panels reveals that the contri-\nbution of stars to the total power is reduced the most, with\nthe reduction factor increasing from an order of magnitude\non the largest scales to more than two orders of magnitude\non the smallest scales. This clearly shows that AGN feed-\nback suppresses star formation, as required to solve the over-\ncooling problem. For the gas component the change is also\ndramatic. While ∆2gas(k) = 1 for λ ∼ 3h−1Mpc in REF,\nthis level of gas power is only reached at 100 h−1 kpc for\nAGN. The suppression of baryonic structure by AGN feed-\nback makes dark matter the dominant component of the\npower spectrum on all scales shown, although it is important\nto note that the dark matter distribution is also significantly\naffected by the AGN, as we shall see next.\n3.4 The back-reaction of baryons on the dark\nmatter\nEven though dark matter is unable to cool through the emis-\nsion of radiation, its distribution can still be altered by the\ninclusion of baryons due to changes in the gravitational po-\ntential. We examine this back-reaction of the baryons on\nthe dark matter for the reference and AGN simulations in\nthe left and right panels of Figure 6, respectively. In order\nto make a direct comparison, we have rescaled the density\nof the dark matter component of the simulations that in-\nclude baryons by multiplying it by the factor Ωm/(Ωm−Ωb).\nThe blue curve shows the relative differences between the\npower spectrum of the rescaled CDM component and that\nof DMONLY.\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n12 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nFigure 7. The dependence of the effect of AGN on cosmology.\nThe curves show the relative differences between the z = 0 matter\npower spectra for models AGN and DMONLY for our fiducial\nWMAP3 cosmology (green) and for the WMAP7 cosmology (red).\nChanging the cosmology has little impact on the relative effect of\nthe baryonic processes.\nOn scales k & 2hMpc−1, corresponding to spatial\nscales λ . 3h−1Mpc, the power in CDM structures in the\nreference simulation is increased by > 1% with respect to\nDMONLY. The difference continues to rise towards higher k,\nreaching 10% around k = 10 hMpc−1. Because the baryons\ncan cool, they are able to collapse to very high densities, and\nin the process they steepen the potential wells of virialized\ndark matter haloes, causing these to contract. The effect is\nlarger closer to the centres of these haloes, i.e. on smaller\nscales.\nThe back-reaction is quite different when AGN feed-\nback is included.6 The dark matter haloes still contract on\nsmall scales, albeit by a smaller amount, but the power in\nthe dark matter component of the AGN simulation is de-\ncreased for scales > 200 h−1 kpc, corresponding to the sizes\nof haloes of L∗ galaxies. The reduction in the power of the\nCDM component in model AGN relative to DMONLY in-\ncreases from roughly 1% at k = 3 hMpc−1 to almost 10%\naround k = 10 hMpc−1. AGN-driven outflows redistribute\ngas to larger scales, which reduces the baryon fractions in\nhaloes and results in shallower potential wells. This is con-\nsistent with the results of Duffy et al. (2010), who used the\nsame simulation to show that AGN feedback decreases the\nconcentrations of dark matter haloes of groups and clusters.\nNote, however, that because AGN can drive gas beyond the\nvirial radii of their host haloes, their effect on the power\nspectrum cannot be fully captured by a simple rescaling of\nthe halo concentrations.\n6 The small difference in power between the CDM component\nof AGN and DMONLY near the size of the box is most likely\ncaused by errors in the power spectrum estimation.\nFigure 8. Evolution of the relative difference between the matter\npower spectra of DMONLY WMAP7 and AGN WMAP7. From\nred to blue, redshift decreases from 3 to zero. The erratic be-\nhaviour of the z = 2 and z = 3 power spectra at the very smallest\nscales shown is due to a lack of resolution. For λ & 1h−1Mpc the\nreduction in power due to baryons evolves only weakly for z . 1,\nbut the transition from a decrease to an increase in power keeps\nmoving to smaller scales.\n3.5 A closer look at the effects of AGN feedback\nIn this section we examine our most realistic model for the\nbaryonic physics, AGN, more closely.\n3.5.1 Dependence on cosmology\nFigure 7 shows how the relative difference between the\nz = 0 power spectra of models AGN WMAP7 and\nDMONLY WMAP7, both of which use the WMAP7 cosmol-\nogy, compares to that between the same physical models in\nthe WMAP3 cosmology (the latter case was already shown\nin Figure 2). Even though the power spectra are themselves\nstrongly influenced by, for example, the much higher value of\nσ8 in the WMAP7 cosmology, the relative change in power\ndue to baryons is nearly identical, at least so long as AGN\nfeedback is included. This is good news for observational\ncosmology. It means that, once the large current scatter in\nimplementations of subgrid physics has converged, it may be\npossible to separate the baryonic effects from the cosmologi-\ncal ones when modelling the matter power spectrum. It also\nmeans that we can assume that our results of the previous\nsections, which were based on the WMAP3 version of the\nAGN simulation, apply also to model AGN WMAP7.\n3.5.2 Evolution\nNext, we use the AGN WMAP7 simulation, which we con-\nsider to be our most realistic model, to investigate the de-\npendence of the effect of baryon physics on redshift. Figure 8\nshows the relative difference between the power spectra of\nDMONLY WMAP7 and AGN WMAP7 at redshifts 3, 2, 1,\n0.5 and zero. We see from this plot that on large scales,\nλ & 1h−1Mpc, the reduction in power due to the gas does\nnot evolve much for z . 1, although the differences between\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 13\nthe different redshifts remain large compared with the preci-\nsion of upcoming surveys. The weak evolution below z = 2 is\nconsistent with McCarthy et al. (2011), who found that the\nexpulsion of gas due to AGN feedback takes place primar-\nily at 2 . z . 4. On scales below 1h−1Mpc, on the other\nhand, the effects of baryonic processes on the power spec-\ntrum keep increasing with time, with the transition point\nbetween a decrease and an increase in power steadily moving\ntowards smaller scales. This is probably because the ejection\nof low-entropy halo gas at high redshift (z & 2) results in an\nincrease of the entropy, and thus a reduction of the cooling\nrates, of hot halo gas at low redshift (McCarthy et al. 2011).\n4 COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS WORK\nOur predictions for the effect of baryons on the matter power\nspectrum agree qualitatively with those of other authors,\nprovided we restrict ourselves to including the same baryonic\nfeedback processes as were considered in those studies. How-\never, previous simulations did not include AGN feedback\nand hence suffered from overcooling.7 As we have demon-\nstrated, AGN feedback (or very efficient stellar feedback)\nhas a dramatic effect on the matter power spectrum over a\nlarge range of scales. In this section we will consider both the\nqualitative and quantitative differences with respect to pre-\nvious work, and examine how these may have come about.\nJing et al. (2006) used gadget ii (Springel 2005) to\nrun a simulation with a 100 h−1Mpc box and 5123 gas\nand DM particles. Their simulation included radiative cool-\ning and star formation, and used the Springel & Hernquist\n(2003) sub-grid model for the multiphase ISM and for galac-\ntic winds driven by star formation. Metal-line cooling and\nAGN feedback were not considered. They found that the\npower at k = 1 hMpc−1 is reduced by ∼ 1% relative to\na dark matter only simulation at z = 0, which matches\nour results for the reference simulation very well. Further-\nmore, in agreement with our reference model, they find that\nthe inclusion of baryons increases the power by ∼ 10% at\nk = 10hMpc−1. However, they find that the transition from\na relative decrease to a relative increase in power occurs at\nk ≈ 2hMpc−1, while we find that it lies at k ≈ 6hMpc−1.\nAs the simulation of Jing et al. (2006) excludes metal-\nline cooling, we expect their results to be in better agreement\nwith our own results for NOZCOOL. The main difference\nwith respect to the reference simulation turns out to be the\nposition of the transition point from a relative decrease to a\nrelative increase in power, which shifts to k ≈ 2−3hMpc−1\nwhen metal-line cooling is turned off. Hence, using the sim-\nulation NOZCOOL, we reproduce both the qualitative and\nquantitative results of Jing et al. (2006), even though bary-\nonic processes such as SN feedback are not implemented in\nthe same way.\nRudd et al. (2008) used the art code (Kravtsov 1999)\nexpanded with the Eulerian hydrodynamics solver described\nin Kravtsov et al. (2002). They used a 60 h−1Mpc box with\n7 The toy model of Levine & Gnedin (2006), which we briefly\ndescribe later in this section, did demonstrate, based purely on\nenergetic grounds, that AGN feedback has the potential to have\na large effect on the matter power spectrum.\n2563 particles, and included radiative cooling and heat-\ning, metal-line cooling, star formation, thermal SN feedback\n(which is described in Kravtsov et al. 2005) and chemical\nenrichment. AGN feedback was not considered. The effect\nof the baryons on the matter power spectrum they found\nis far more dramatic than that found by Jing et al. (2006)\nand ourselves: a decrease in power of up to ∼ 10% relative\nto a dark matter only simulation for k < 1hMpc−1, and a\nrelative increase in power at k & 1hMpc−1 which already\nreaches ∼ 50% at k ≈ 5hMpc−1. The reason for these large\ndifferences is unclear.\nGuillet et al. (2010) used the MareNostrum simulation,\nwhich was run using the adaptive mesh refinement code\nramses (Teyssier 2002), to investigate the effects of baryons\non both the variance and the skewness of the mass distri-\nbution. They used a 50h−1Mpc box with 10243 dark mat-\nter particles and included metal-dependent gas cooling, UV\nheating, star formation, SN feedback (using the kinetic feed-\nback prescription of Dubois & Teyssier 2008) and metal en-\nrichment. AGN feedback was not considered. Unfortunately,\nthey were not able to run their simulations down to z = 0,\nbut quote results at redshift 2 instead. In order to better\ncompare to their results, we have examined the power spec-\ntra of REF L100N512 and DMONLY L100N512 at z = 2.\nIn our reference simulation the scale on which baryons sig-\nnificantly reduce the power increases with time (note that\nAGN shows the opposite behaviour, see Fig. 8): in REF\nthe 1% level is first reached at k ≈ 2 hMpc−1 for z = 2\nand at k ≈ 0.8 hMpc−1 for z = 0. Meanwhile, the effect\non the power on scales k & 10hMpc−1 hardly changes,\nand the transition scale from a decrease to an increase in\npower relative to DMONLY remains fixed at k ≈ 7hMpc−1.\nGuillet et al. (2010), on the other hand, do not detect a sys-\ntematic decrease in power due to baryons at any scale. They\nfind that the power is increased by 1% relative to a dark\nmatter only simulation at k ≈ 3hMpc−1, reaching 40% at\nk ≈ 10 hMpc−1. For our reference model we instead find a\n2% decrease for k ≈ 3 hMpc−1 and only a 6% increase at\nk ≈ 10 hMpc−1. It is hard to say why these results lie so far\napart, and especially why the baryons in their simulation do\nnot reduce the power on large scales due to pressure effects.\nWe also compare to the recent study by Casarini et al.\n(2011), who use the SPH code gasoline (Wadsley et al.\n2004) to perform their simulations. They use two different\nvolumes: a box of 64h−1Mpc on a side, and a much larger\n256 h−1Mpc box, both with only 2563 dark matter and an\nequal number of gas particles. Note that the mass resolution\nof their L = 64 h−1Mpc run is comparable to that of our\nfiducial run, while the resolution of their L = 256 h−1Mpc\nrun is much poorer. They include radiative cooling, a UV\nbackground, star formation and SN feedback. For the latter\nthey use the prescription of Stinson et al. (2006), in which\nType II SNe are modelled using an analytical treatment\nof blastwaves combined with manually turning off radiative\ncooling. Metal-line cooling and AGN feedback were not con-\nsidered. Using their 64 h−1Mpc box, Casarini et al. (2011)\nfind an ∼ 1% decrease in power at k ≈ 1 − 2hMpc−1\nand an increase in power at smaller scales, which reaches\n20% at k ≈ 10 hMpc−1. These results are in reasonable\nagreement with both Jing et al. (2006) and our model NOZ-\nCOOL. However, when using their 256 h−1Mpc box, they –\nlike Guillet et al. (2010) – find no decrease in power due\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n14 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nto baryons at any scale, but instead a steady increase in\npower that reaches 1% at k ≈ 1 − 3 hMpc−1 and 40% at\nk ≈ 10hMpc−1.\nFinally, we discuss the work by Levine & Gnedin\n(2006), who used a toy model, rather than a hydrodynamic\nsimulation, to evaluate the potential effect of AGN feedback\non the matter power spectrum. In their models only the evo-\nlution of dark matter was followed explicitly. The gas was\nassumed to trace the dark matter at all scales and galaxy\nformation and the associated physical processes were not\nincluded. Their standard simulation volume is 64 h−1Mpc\non a side, and the simulation was run with resolutions of\n1, 0.5 and 0.25 h−1Mpc. We note that even their highest\nresolution is more than two orders of magnitude below the\nspatial resolution in our standard simulations. The gas was\nassumed to have a constant temperature of 1.5×104K at all\nredshifts. A quasar luminosity function was used to deter-\nmine the number of AGN at a given redshift and luminosity,\nwhich were then each placed at a random location, although\nbiased towards high-density regions. Of the AGN’s bolomet-\nric luminosity, a fraction ǫk = 1% was used to drive spheri-\ncally symmetric outflows. Within these outflow regions the\nbaryon fraction was assumed to be zero. After computing\nthe power spectrum, they found a large discrepancy between\nsimulations with different resolutions: when using a resolu-\ntion of 1h−1Mpc, they found a reduction of roughly 10%\nin power for 0.3 . k . 3hMpc−1 at z = 0, relative to a\nsimulation which did not include AGN, while their higher-\nresolution runs produced instead an increase in power at all\nscales, of up to 20%. We found a decrease in power of 1% at\nk ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1, reaching > 10% for 2 . k . 50hMpc−1,\nwhich does not agree with their results, even in terms of the\nsign of the effect. Nevertheless, we do confirm the conclusion\nof Levine & Gnedin (2006) that AGN feedback can greatly\naffect the matter power spectrum on a wide range of scales.\nEven though our current understanding of galaxy for-\nmation still allows for significant deviations between studies,\nsome qualitative results are the same: in the absence of AGN\nfeedback, baryons will affect the matter power spectrum sig-\nnificantly on scales k ∼ 1 − 10hMpc−1. Furthermore, all\nstudies agree that the increase in power due to baryons is of\nthe order of 10% at k = 10 hMpc−1. Jing et al. (2006), our\nreference and NOZCOOL models, and Casarini et al. (2011)\nfor their high-resolution simulation all predict a relative de-\ncrease in power of ∼ 1% at k ≈ 1hMpc−1. Rudd et al.\n(2008) also find a decrease in power due to baryons, but in\ntheir case the effect is far stronger than that of any other\nstudy, and is seen at much larger scales (k . 1hMpc−1).\nHowever, like our reference simulation, all these simu-\nlations suffer from the well-known overcooling problem. As\nwas demonstrated by McCarthy et al. (2010), the AGN sim-\nulation does not. We have shown that the inclusion of AGN\nhas a tremendous effect on the matter power spectrum for\nλ . 10 h−1Mpc, both when compared to a simulation that\nincludes only dark matter and when compared to simula-\ntions that include baryons and galaxy formation but not\nAGN feedback. Therefore, contrary to what, for example,\nGuillet et al. (2010) claim, simulations that suffer from over-\ncooling cannot be considered extreme models for which the\neffects of baryons on the total matter power spectrum are\nmaximised. Instead, they are prone to underestimate the ef-\nfects on large scales. Indeed, model AGN predicts a relative\ndecrease in power of ∼ 1% already at k = 0.4 hMpc−1. The\ndecrease in power reaches several tens of percent on scales\nk ∼ 1−10 hMpc−1, while simulations that suffer from over-\ncooling instead predict a strong increase in at least part of\nthis range. Based on our results and on the comparison to\nother studies, we argue that the inclusion of AGN in cosmo-\nlogical simulations is at present even more important than\nthe improvement or convergence of existing prescriptions for\nother baryonic effects.\nMotivated by the results of Rudd et al. (2008),\nZentner et al. (2008) have proposed a method to account\nfor the effects of galaxy formation on the matter power spec-\ntrum. This method assumes that the effects of baryons can\nbe captured by a change in the halo concentration-mass rela-\ntion. However, it is unlikely that such an approach can truly\nmodel the effects of baryons on the power spectrum. Since\nAGN-driven outflows significantly affect scales much larger\nthan the sizes of individual haloes, the assumption made by\nZentner et al. (2008) will certainly not be valid when AGN\nfeedback is included.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nUpcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID,\nand WFIRST aim to measure the matter power spectrum\nwith unprecedented accuracy. In order to fully exploit these\nobservations, theoretical models are needed that can pre-\ndict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of\n1% or better on scales corresponding to 0.1 h−1Mpc . k .\n10hMpc−1. Here, we have employed a large suite of simula-\ntions from the OWLS project, as well as the highly accurate\npower spectrum estimator powmes, to investigate the effects\nof various baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum.\nThese tools have also enabled us to examine the distribution\nof power over different mass components, the back-reaction\nof baryons on the CDM, and the evolution of the dominant\neffects on the matter power spectrum.\nOur most important finding is that the feedback pro-\ncesses that are required to solve the overcooling problem (i.e.\nthe overproduction of stars), have a dramatic effect on the\nmatter power spectrum. Such efficient feedback, most likely\nin the form of outflows driven by AGN, were not present\nin the simulations used in previous studies of the effects\nof baryons on the matter power spectrum (Jing et al. 2006;\nRudd et al. 2008; Guillet et al. 2010; Casarini et al. 2011).\nAlthough it was generally assumed that overcooling would\nmake the simulations conservative, in the sense that they\nwould overestimate the baryonic effects, we demonstrated\nthat the opposite is true. The efficient outflows that are re-\nquired to reproduce optical and X-ray observations of groups\nof galaxies, redistribute the gas on large scales, thereby re-\nducing the total power by & 10% on scales k & 1 hMpc−1.\nWe emphasise that the model from which we draw this\nconclusion, the simulation that includes AGN feedback, is\nnot extreme. On the contrary, we consider it our most re-\nalistic model. McCarthy et al. (2010, 2011) showed that it\nprovides excellent agreement with both optical and X-ray\nobservables of groups of galaxies at redshift zero. In partic-\nular, it reproduces the temperature, entropy, and metallicity\nprofiles of the gas, as well as the stellar masses, star forma-\ntion rates, and age distributions of the central galaxies, and\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\nGalaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 15\nthe relations between X-ray luminosity and both tempera-\nture and mass.\nWe showed that metal-line cooling, star formation, and\nfeedback from SNe all modify the matter power spectrum\nby > 1% on the scales relevant for upcoming surveys. In\nthe absence of AGN feedback, the simulations with baryons\nhave ∼ 1% less power relative to a dark matter only simu-\nlation on scales 0.8 . k . 6hMpc−1 (a consequence of gas\npressure) and > 10% more power for k & 10 hMpc−1 (a con-\nsequence of gas cooling). However, as we noted above, AGN\nfeedback can decrease the power for 1 . k . 10 hMpc−1\nby up to several tens of percent. Furthermore, some imple-\nmentations of stellar feedback, e.g. the strong SN feedback\nresulting from a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in\nstarbursts, can create differences of the same scope and mag-\nnitude by redistributing gas out to very large scales. The\neffects from such baryonic processes on the matter power\nspectrum can even exceed those of a very large change in\ncosmology (e.g. WMAP3 to WMAP1). Indeed, differences\n> 1% persist even up to scales as large as those correspond-\ning to k ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1.\nIn the absence of AGN feedback, the back-reaction of\nbaryons on the dark matter increases the power in the CDM\ncomponent by 1% at k ≈ 2hMpc−1 and the effect becomes\nlarger towards smaller scales. However, when AGN are in-\ncluded they redistribute sufficiently large quantities of gas\nout to large radii to lower the power in the dark matter com-\nponent by 1 − 10% for 3 . k . 30hMpc−1. This is consis-\ntent with Duffy et al. (2010), who used the same simulation\nto show that AGN feedback decreases the concentrations of\ndark matter haloes of groups of galaxies. We stress, how-\never, that the back-reaction of AGN feedback on the CDM\nwill not be straightforward to implement in dark matter only\nmodels. While it may be possible to roughly model the effect\nof baryons in simulations without efficient feedback by rais-\ning the concentration parameters of the dark matter haloes\n(e.g. Zentner et al. 2008), feedback from AGN redistributes\nthe gas on scales that exceed those of their host haloes.\nThe difference between dark matter only simulations\nand simulations that do include baryons is nearly the same\nfor the WMAP3 and WMAP7 cosmologies, at least when\nAGN are included. This suggests that the relative effect of\nthe baryons is roughly independent of cosmology, which will\nsimplify future studies aiming to disentangle the two.\nFor our most realistic simulation, which assumes the\nWMAP7 cosmology and includes AGN feedback, the differ-\nence in power relative to the corresponding dark matter only\nsimulation does not evolve much for z . 1 on large scales\n(k < 10 hMpc−1). This is consistent with McCarthy et al.\n(2011), who showed that the expulsion of gas through AGN\nfeedback occurs mostly at z ∼ 2 − 4, in the progenitors of\ntoday’s groups and clusters of galaxies.\nWe demonstrated that our conclusions are robust with\nrespect to changes in the size of the simulation box and\nchanges in the resolution (see Appendix A), with any addi-\ntional modelling uncertainties only making it less likely that\nthe matter power spectrum can be predicted with 1% accu-\nracy any time soon. Looking at the large differences that still\nexist between the results of different authors, it is clear that\nmuch work remains to be done in understanding processes\nsuch as gas cooling and outflows.\nIn a forthcoming paper (Semboloni et al., in prepa-\nration), we will study the implications of our findings for\nweak lensing surveys in more detail. In this work we will\nalso demonstrate that the use of optical and X-ray observa-\ntions of groups of galaxies can significantly reduce the un-\ncertainties in the predictions of the matter power spectrum.\nWhile this provides a strong incentive for obtaining better\nand more observations of groups of galaxies, it is important\nto note that such auxiliary data will never completely re-\nmove the uncertainty inherent to cosmological probes of the\nmatter distribution on scales that are potentially affected\nby baryonic physics. This is because one can never be sure\nthat all the relevant effects are constrained by the secondary\nobservations. For example, it may be that other models for\nthe baryonic physics exist that also reproduce optical and\nX-ray observations of groups, but nevertheless predict dif-\nferent power spectra. It will therefore be crucial to consider\na wide variety of observations, with optical and X-ray as\nwell as Sunyaev-Zel’dovich observations holding particular\npromise, and a large range of models.\nWhile the strong baryonic effects that we find imply\nthat the cosmological constraints provided by upcoming\nweak lensing surveys will be model-dependent, it also means\nthat such surveys will provide constraints on the physics of\ngalaxy formation on scales that are difficult to obtain by\nother means.\nTabulated values of power spectra for redshifts z = 0−\n6 are available for all the simulations shown in this paper\nas Supporting Information with the online version of this\narticle, and at http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/VD11/ (see\nAppendix B).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank all members of the OWLS team for their contribu-\ntions to the project.

The difference between the power spectrum of the\n100 and the 50 h−1Mpc box is smaller than the difference\nbetween the latter and the 25 h−1Mpc box for all k, and\nthe power spectrum of the largest box is nearly converged\nfor k & 20 hMpc−1.\nHowever, there are differences of up to a factor of a few\nat larger scales. For reference, we also show the input power\nspectrum linearly evolved to z = 0 and the HALOFIT model\nof the non-linear power spectrum by Smith et al. (2003) (see\n§3.1). The first wave mode corresponds to the size of the sim-\nulation box, which means that the power measured on this\nscale is meaningless; hence, we have omitted this point in\nall of our figures. The second and third wave modes closely\nfollow the linear power spectrum. Note that the curves have\nvery similar shapes on large scales, with the larger boxes\nshifted to larger scales. This is a consequence of employing\nthe same seed for the random number generator used to cre-\nate the initial conditions. Perturbations that should go non-\nlinear (λ . 10 h−1Mpc) are unable to collapse if their wave-\nlength is close to the size of the box, which in turn suppresses\nthe power on smaller scales. One might therefore worry that\neven the 100 h−1Mpc box is not large enough to obtain ac-\ncurate power spectra for k & 1hMpc−1. Lacking larger sim-\nulations to check this, we compare to the HALOFIT model\nfor the non-linear power spectrum, which shows where the\ntransition from the linear power spectrum should take place\nat redshift zero. The power spectrum for the 100 h−1Mpc\nbox follows this model very well on large scales, suggesting\nthat a simulation of this size is very close to converged.\nNote that finite volume effects only prevent us from ob-\ntaining highly accurate absolute power spectra, and only for\nthe largest scales, while our results are based on the rela-\ntive comparisons between models that used identical initial\nconditions. Since the 100 h−1Mpc box extends up to the\nlargest non-linear scales, and since all simulations start from\nthe exact same realisation of the linear power spectrum at\nz = 127, we do not expect our results to be affected by the\nfinite volume of the simulations.\nA2 Numerical resolution\nIn Figure A2 we investigate the effects of changing the reso-\nlution for the reference simulation by varying the number of\nparticles while keeping the box size fixed. The power spec-\ntrum of REF L100N128 is quite noisy for k & 100 hMpc−1\nbecause of its much higher Poisson noise level. Testing\nfor convergence on these scales is only possible thanks\nto the accurate shot noise subtraction. Surprisingly, the\nrelative difference in power between REF L100N128 and\nREF L100N512 is smaller than the difference between the\nlatter and REF L100N256. When increasing the resolution\nbeyond that of REF L100N256, the power begins to de-\ncrease. To examine if this trend continues, we compare the\nFigure A1. Test of convergence of the z = 0 matter power spec-\ntrum in the reference model with respect to the size of the simu-\nlated volume, where the box size and particle number are varied\nin such a way as to keep the resolution constant. Also shown are\nthe linear input power spectrum and the analytical non-linear\npower spectrum by Smith et al. (2003). The red, dotted line in\nthe top panel shows the (subtracted) theoretical shot noise level.\nThe bottom panel shows the ratio of REF L100N512 with respect\nto the other simulations.\npower spectrum of REF L050N256, which has the same res-\nolution as REF L100N512, to that of REF L050N512 in the\npanel on the right. We see that the power on the smallest\nscales (k & 10hMpc−1) converges only slowly, but that the\ntrend of decreasing power with increasing resolution contin-\nues. This may indicate that, as lower mass haloes become\nresolved, the overall effects of supernova feedback become\nstronger.\nWe can verify this by isolating the effects due to baryon\nphysics from those due to a more straightforward depen-\ndence on resolution. To this end, we examine what the effect\nis of increasing the particle number of the DMONLY simu-\nlation with a 100 h−1Mpc box in Figure A3. The behaviour\nhere is quite different: as N grows, more low-mass haloes\nare resolved and the power on small scales increases. As we\nobserve a reversed trend in Figure A2, we conclude that the\nincreased baryonic effects that accompany a higher particle\nnumber are more important for the power spectrum than\nthe straightforward dependence on resolution.\nThe difference between REF L050N256 and\nREF L050N512 is ∼ 0.1% at k = 1hMpc−1 and\n∼ 2% at k = 10 hMpc−1. We conclude that simulation\nREF L100N512 is sufficiently converged for the scales of\ninterest for this study, k . 10 hMpc−1. Note that, since\nwe are only interested in the relative differences between\nsimulations with equal resolution, the uncertainty will in\npractice be much smaller. With increased resolution we ex-\npect feedback processes to become more effective, meaning\nthat we may have underpredicted the differences between\nmodels with different feedback processes in low-mass haloes\non small scales.\nSimilar tests were performed by Colombi et al. (2009)\nc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18\n18 M. P. van Daalen et al.\nFigure A2. As in Figure A1, but now the numerical resolution is varied while keeping the box size constant. The left and right panels\nshow power spectra for box sizes of 100 and 50h−1Mpc, respectively. On small scales, k > 10hMpc−1, convergence is slow.\nFigure A3. Same as the left-hand panel of Figure A2, but now for\nDMONLY instead of REF. Here the behaviour is as expected: as\nthe number of particles goes up, more low-mass haloes form and\nthe power on small scales increases. A comparison with Figure A2\nshows that increasing the resolution leads to stronger baryonic\neffects which may reverse the sign of the trend with resolution.\nfor the convergence of powmes, which keeps the statistical\nerror bounded through its use of foldings.

For our fiducial grid with 2563 grid\ncells, one can expect the statistical error to remain below\n|∆P |/P ≈ 1.2% as long as errors due to shot noise do not\ndominate. We have checked that this is indeed the case. Note\nthat this means that we can confidently measure 1% differ-\nences between simulations using our fiducial values, as we\nTable B1.

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the \nfeatures of these diseases with variable frequency; it is more prevalent in Sjögren syn-\ndrome. Peripheral neuropathy is often seen in the course of the disease. Nonetheless, \nit may be also a presenting sign or the unique feature of immune system dysfunction. \nNeuropathies in connective tissue diseases are related mainly to vasculitic disorder. It \nrequires prompt diagnosis and treatment to improve its outcome. Peripheral neuropa-\nthy in connective tissue diseases could be multifocal and asymmetric, or confluent \nand symmetrical. This chapter reviews the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic fea-\ntures of neuropathies associated with the common diffuse connective tissue diseases.\nKeywords: peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis, connective tissue disease,  \ntreatment, electromyography, nerve biopsy\n1. Introduction\nConnective tissue diseases (CTDs) are defined as a group of acquired diseases \nresulting from persistent immune-mediated inflammation. They are generally the \nconsequence of autoimmune dysregulation resulting in generation of autoreactive T \ncells or autoantibodies [1]. Immune disorders can affect any organ of the human body \nresponsible for multisystem involvement. The CTDs classily include systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome (SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), dermatomyosi-\ntis and polymyositis (PM/DM), undifferentiated CTD (UTCD) and overlap syndromes \nsuch as mixed CTD (MCTD). Most clinicians do not include systemic necrotizing vas-\nculitis, e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome and Wegener’s granuloma-\ntosis in the category of CTD [1]. Peripheral neuropathies (PN) may complicate many \ndifferent systemic autoimmune diseases. PN in CTD large clinical, histopathological \nand pathogenic spectrum [2]. We aim in this chapter to precise the epidemiology, \nthe pathogenesis, the diagnosis and the treatment of neuropathies in CTD including \nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome (SS), dermatomyositis and \npolymyositis (PM/DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and mixed CTD (MCTD).\n2.  Epidemiology of peripheral neuropathy associated with connective \ntissue diseases and its topographic distribution\nPN is one of the clinical features of CTD with variable frequency and prognosis. \nIt is often seen in the course of the disease. However, it may also be a presenting \nDemystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions\n2\nsign or the unique feature of immune system dysfunction [3]. The prevalence of \nPN is different in the literature series depending on the type of CTD and the means \nof diagnosis. The incidence of PN in SS is 10–60%, and many of these patients \n(40–93%) present with neuropathy as the sentinel symptom [4]. PN in SLE patients \nranges from 25 to 50% based on electrodiagnostic studies. Curiously, the incidence \ndrops to only 5% based on clinical criteria [5, 6]. Finally, PN is rarely associated \nwith the other CTD, namely, SSc, MCTD, DM and PM [4].\nPN refers to the part of a spinal nerve distal to the root and plexus. It is a damage \nor a disease affecting nerves [7–9]. Neuropathy affecting one nerve is called “mono-\nneuropathy” and neuropathy affecting multiple nerves in the same areas on both \nsides of the body is named “symmetrical polyneuropathy”. When separate nerves in \ndisparate areas of the body are affected, the neuropathy is called mononeuritis multi-\nplex, multifocal mononeuropathy or multiple mononeuropathy [8, 10, 11]. Types of \nneuropathies that are associated with CTD are outlined in Table 1.\n3. Pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in connective tissue diseases\nThe principal components in the pathogenesis of peripheral nerve lesions in \ndiffuse CTD are ischemia due to vasculitis and immune abnormalities. Generally, \nmost of patients have a combination of the ischemic, immunological and metabolic \nmechanisms of damage to the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, one com-\nponent may be predominant in a different stage of the disease. In systemic sclero-\nderma, the greater role is played by ischemic mechanisms, mainly in the initial \nstates of the disease, while SLE may involve the participation of immunological \nmechanisms, especially in acute and subacute disease with high level of autoim-\nmune activity [13].\n3.1 Vasculitic neuropathy\nThe immunopathogenesis of vasculitis in CTD is still unclear. The accumulation \nof immune complexes in the vasa nervorum initiates the leukocytoclastic reaction, \nwhich is characterized by segmental fibrinoid necrosis and transmural inflam-\nmatory cell infiltration. Vasculitis induces the occlusion of vasa nervorum at the \nVasculitic neuropathy\n Mononeuropathy multiplex\n Asymmetrical polyneuropathy\n Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy\nDistal axonal polyneuropathy\nCompression neuropathy\nSensory neuronopathy\nTrigeminal sensory neuropathy\nOther types of neuropathies associated with connective tissue disease\n Acute demyelinating polyneuropathy\n Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy\nTable 1. \nTypes of neuropathies associated with CTD (adapted from neuropathies in connective tissue disease/Richard K) [12].\n3Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue Diseases\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271\nepineurial arteries and produces nerve infarction. Nerve infarcts typically lead to \naxonal degeneration [14]. Demyelination and conduction block may occur tran-\nsiently but are usually not a predominant or persistent finding [15]. The clinical and \nelectrophysiological features of neuropathies correlate with the rapidity of onset \nof ischemia. Acute ischemia induces the development of mononeuropathy, while \nprolonged circulatory insufficiency is associated with chronic polyneuropathy. The \ncompression-ischemic mechanism leads to the formation of tunnel syndromes [13, \n14, 16, 17]. The Peripheral Nerve Society task force has recently proposed a clas-\nsification that categorizes vasculitic neuropathy into primary systemic vasculitides, \nsecondary systemic vasculitides including CTD and nonsystemic or localized \nvasculitis on the basis of disease associations [18].\n3.2 Autoimmune disorders\nPatients with diffuse CTD may have IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies \nin their serum, which are associated with severe signs of neural lesions, as dem-\nonstrated by electromyogram [13]. Moreover, serum levels of anti-nerve growth \nfactor (NGF) antibodies are greater than normal in 32.1% of patients with diffuse \nCTD. Increased serum levels of anti-NGF are associated with high disease activity \nand more severe nervous system involvement [13].\n3.3 Metabolic disorder\nPeripheral nervous system abnormalities in CTD are also explained by metabolic \ndisorder secondary to aggressive therapy, multiorgan pathology and endocrine \nabnormalities in these patients. Metabolic disorder may induce a reaction of demy-\nelization and axon dystrophy in severe cases [13].\n4. Clinical practice guidelines of peripheral neuropathy in CTD\nIn CTD neuropathic symptoms often start gradually and then get worse. Deep \nproximal aching pain is the first sign in the affected limb. Burning pain in the \ncutaneous distribution of the affected nerve is frequent. Weakness and numbness \nusually appear over several hours to several days after the pain. The delay of the \nformer symptoms is explained by the nerve infarction. On physical examination, \nmost patients have pain and temperature sensory loss in the distribution of the \naffected nerve. A few patients have impairment of vibration and position sense. \nHyporeflexia is also rare except in the ankles. In fact, tendon reflexes other than \nat the ankle are lost only if the femoral, musculocutaneous, or radial nerves are \naffected proximally [12, 18, 19]. The quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a tool \nto analyse the perception in response to external stimuli of controlled intensity. It \nhas been used for the early diagnosis and follow-up of small fibre neuropathies. \nAlthough the QST is time-consuming and it is modified also in non-neuropathic \npain as in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory myalgia, it cannot be taken \nalone as a conclusive demonstration of PN [20]. The QST is helpful to quantify the \neffects of treatments on allodynia and hyperalgesia and may reveal a differential \nefficacy of treatments on different pain components (grade A) [20]. According to \nEFNS international guidelines, to evaluate hyperalgesia in PN, it is recommended \nto use simple tools such as a brush and at least one high-intensity weighted pin-\nprick or von Frey filament. The evaluation of pain in response to thermal stimuli \nDemystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions\n4\nis best performed by using the thermotest which is recommended for pathophysi-\nological research or treatment trials. The DN4 may be a useful instrument for the \ndaily diagnostic of PN in CTD [21].\n5. Diagnosis and clinical results\nIn patient with multiorgan involvement and mononeuropathy multiplex, the \ndiagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy is usually easy. However, the diagnosis may be \nmore difficult in less typical presentations of CTD or when peripheral neuropathy is \nthe unique manifestation of the disease. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in \nCTD particularly in atypical situation is based first on clinical and physical exami-\nnations. Electromyography confirms even an underlying axonal neuropathy. The \nmost characteristic electromyographic finding in vasculitic neuropathy described in \nthe previous series is axonal degeneration with multifocal distribution. The typical \nfeature is a low sensory nerve and compound muscle action potential amplitudes in \na non-length-dependent distribution with normal or minimally reduced conduction \nvelocities [15, 17, 22, 23]. A partial conduction block is rare, and it is seen transiently \nand early in stage of nerve ischemia [12]. Laboratory tests may be helpful in estab-\nlishing the presence of systemic vasculitis or identifying previously undiagnosed \nconnective tissue disease. Evaluation of patients with suspected neuropathy in \nCTD should include liver and kidney function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation \nrate, urinalysis as well as a complete blood count. The choice of immunological test \nincluding rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, cryoglobulins, antineutrophil \ncytoplasmic autoantibody and serum complement depends on the clinical pre-\nsentation of the patient. Nerve biopsy may be helpful in demonstrating vasculitic \nprocess. A concomitant muscle specimen is useful to increase diagnostic yield \nbecause of the patchy distribution of vasculitic lesions [18].\n6. Particularity of PN in each CTD\n6.1 Peripheral neuropathy in Sjögren syndrome\nSjögren syndrome is a CTD more prevalent in women at the age of menopause. It \nis characterized by sicca syndrome and other extra-glandular symptoms. Peripheral \nnervous involvement in Sjögren syndrome (SS) is reported with variable frequency \nbecause of diverse methods for detection of neuropathy and may precede the onset \nof the disease or be the initial diagnostic clue [24]. The most common feature is \nsymmetrical distal sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and trigeminal \nsensory neuropathy. Mononeuritis multiplex, chronic inflammatory demyelinating \nneuropathy and motor neuropathy are less common [8].\n6.1.1 Ganglionopathies\nSensory ganglionopathy is characterized by an impairment of kinesthetic aware-\nness. Patients have the profound handicap of proprioceptive sense affecting larger \njoints. Electromyogram shows unelicitable sensory nerve action potentials, with \npreservation of compound motor action potentials [25]. When MRI is performed, \nit can reveal T2 hyperintensities limited to the gracile and cuneatus tracts of the \ndorsal spinal cord with sensory neuronopathies [26]. There are two mechanisms \nevoked in the pathogenesis of gangliopathies in SS. First, the cellular autoimmu-\nnity, confirmed by the infiltration of mononuclear and predominantly T cells in \n5Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue Diseases\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271\nthe dorsal root ganglia, is associated with cellular degeneration in the absence of \nvasculitis [25, 27, 28]. Second, recent studies have suggested that the presence of \nantibodies against the G-bodies, which are a subcellular aggregation of noncoding \nRNA intermediates and proteins, is associated to neuropathy [29, 30]. Moreover, \nIt was reported that antineuronal antibodies were seen more frequently in Sjögren \npatients with severe peripheral neuropathy (PN) complications [25].\n6.1.2 Small fibre neuropathies\nSmall fibre neuropathy is the most common PN manifestation of SS. It is a \npainful, sensory neuropathy affecting the nociceptive A-alpha and unmyelinated \nC-fibres. Small fibre neuropathy is reported with variable frequency. In the Hopkins \nGreen Sjögren cohort, it was described as the most frequent manifestation [31]. The \nonset of small fibre neuropathy is usually subacute to chronic, occurring over weeks \nto months, although cases with hyperacute evolution of hours to days have been \nreported [27]. The cardinal clinical symptom of isolated small fibre neuropathy is an \nexcruciating burning pain. The physical examination reveals a selective impairment \nin small-fibre modalities of pinprick and temperature, with relatively preserved \nvibratory sense and proprioception. The diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy is based \non skin biopsy, which assesses the low density of intraepidermal nerve fibres [25, 32].\n6.1.3 Sensorimotor polyneuropathies\nThe majority of studies reported that axonal polyneuropathies as the most \nfrequent type of PN in SS. The onset of sensorimotor polyneuropathy is usually sub-\nacute or chronic. The axonal sensory neuropathies are characterized by propriocep-\ntive sensory loss and motor reflexes, and there are diminished sensory nerve action \npotentials in electromyogram [25]. The sensory symptoms, however, are gradually \naccompanied by muscle weakness in a distal, symmetrical distribution [32].\n6.1.4 Multiple mononeuropathy\nIt is the transduction of vasculitic neuropathy, and it is very uncommon in SS \nreported in 0–5% in previous studies. It is usually associated with extra-glandular \nmanifestations [25, 27, 33–35]. Patients with SS and presenting mononeuritis multiplex \nshould be assessed for cryoglobulinemia polyclonal (types II and III) rather than mono-\nclonal (type I) mainly when there is high-titer rheumatoid factor positivity or when \nthere is disproportionate C4 hypocomplementemia, with normal levels of C3. When \nnerve biopsy is performed, it may show a lymphocytic or necrotizing vasculitis [32].\n6.1.5 Cranial neuropathies\nThe most common cranial neuropathy in SS is the trigeminal neuropathy, which \nis usually progressive and can be bilateral and requires symptomatic treatment. \nMotor dysfunction of cranial nerves is less common, and the facial nerve is the most \ncranial nerve targeted. The acute onset of cranial neuropathy is due to vasculitic \nmechanism especially when associated with equally rapid development of multiple \nmononeuropathies in the extremities [25].\n6.1.6 Demyelinating neuropathies\nDemyelinating neuropathy is a rare manifestation of SS [32, 33]. Cases of \nchronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy have been the subject of case \nDemystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions\n6\nreports in Sjögren patients but have not been substantially described in larger case \nseries. The most common neurophysiologic finding in demyelinating neuropathies \nwas demyelination of the motor nerves [36–38]. The onset of this neuropathy is \nsubacute and characterized by severe proximal and distal weakness and proprio-\nceptive sensory deficit. Treatment with steroid and sometimes with intravenous \nimmune globulins may be effective [32, 39].\n6.1.7 Autonomic neuropathy\nAutonomic neuropathy is the rarest type of peripheral nerve involvement in \nSS because it is usually underdiagnosed. The clinical manifestations of autonomic \nneuropathy will vary depending on the organs which are affected. Symptoms range \nfrom urinary symptoms to severe disabling postural hypotension [27, 32, 38]. In \nrecent studies, autonomic dysfunction is associated with the severity of fatigue in \npatients with primary SS. However, no association was detected between autonomic \ndysfunction and exocrine function in these patients [32, 40].\n6.2 Peripheral neuropathy in systemic erythematosus lupus\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with \na broad spectrum of clinical presentations as cutaneous, renal and articular \nmanifestations (Figure 1). Affected patients typically have subacute or chronic \ndistal symmetrical polyneuropathies with predominant sensory symptoms. Distal \nsymmetrical axonal degeneration is the major feature of most cases, although other \ntypes of peripheral neuropathy have been described [12, 41]. Oomatia reported \nthe subtypes of peripheral neuropathy (PN) attributable to SLE in a group of 82 \npatients out of 2097 and detailed in Table 2 [42]. Other features such as Guillain-\nBarré syndrome, plexopathy and autonomic neuropathy are very low in all series \nFigure 1. \nButterfly rash in systemic lupus erythematosus.\n7Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue Diseases\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271\n[41]. In recent data, small fibre neuropathy is more frequent in SLE, and the \ndecreased intraepidermal nerve fibre density of unmyelinated fibres is a diagnostic \ntest [42]. The mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy in SLE are unclear. Several \nfactors have been reported particularly small-vessel vasculitis and lesions induced \nby autoimmune antibodies and immune complexes. In series, where nerve biopsy \nis performed, the anatomopathologic aspect was perivascular mononuclear cell \ninfiltration and variable intimal thickening without necrotizing vasculitis. The \npresence of necrotizing vasculitis is possible and constitutes a prognostic factor of \nthe disease [12, 41, 43]. Endoneurial mononuclear cell infiltration and increased \nclass II antigen expression were also noticed [12, 43].\n6.3 Peripheral neuropathy in systemic sclerosis\nSystemic sclerosis is a rare connective tissue disease with a prevalence of 1 in \n10,000 [44]. It is characterized by symmetrical, widespread thickening of the skin \n(Figure 2) [45]. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy is unknown with reported \nranges in retrospective studies varying from 0.01 to 14% of patients [46, 47]. \nVascular-dependent neuropathy is the principal mechanism inducing a distal \nsymmetric, mainly sensory polyneuropathy as in other connective tissue diseases \n[13, 46, 47]. Cranial mononeuropathies can also occur, mainly the trigeminal \nnerve, leading to numbness and dysesthesias in the face. Rarely the seventh and \nninth cranial neuropathies are affected [11]. The electrophysiological features are \nthose of sensory axonopathy [11]. Rare cases of mononeuritis multiplex have been \nmentioned in the course of limited SSc (CREST: calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, \noesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) and are due to a necrotizing \nvasculitis [11].\n6.4 Peripheral neuropathy in mixed connective tissue disease\nMixed connective tissue disease is defined as the overlap of SLE, SSc and PM, \nwith a high titer of extractable nuclear antigen and its ribonucleoprotein compo-\nnent [48]. Mild distal axonal polyneuropathy was exceptionally reported in 2 of \n20 patients with mixed connective tissue disease, but there has not been a detailed \nstudy of the neuropathy or its treatment [48].\nType of peripheral neuropathy Frequency no.

[42].\nDemystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions\n8\n6.5 Peripheral neuropathy in dermatomyositis and polymyositis\nNerve involvement in patients with DM is mediated through membrane attack \ncomplex (MAC) formation, leading to nerve injury. This entity called “neuromyo-\nsitis” was first reported in 1890 [49]. Further studies showed a frequency of 7.5% in \nDM or PM patients with polyneuropathy [50]. Neuropathy due to DM is difficult to \ndiagnose due to necessity of excluding other comorbid etiologic conditions and het-\nerogeneity of muscular manifestations [49]. Nerve biopsy may reveal endothelial \nvascular injury, and immunohistochemical stains revealed increased expression of \nperivascular VEGF and demyelinization associated or not with inflammation [51].\n7. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy in CTD\n7.1 General approach\nThere are no treatment guidelines specific to each CTD. In general, the manage-\nment of PN is based on symptomatic treatment of pain as in other causes of neurop-\nathies. Typically, patients with painful polyneuropathies respond to drugs known to \nbe effective for neuropathic pain, including tricyclic antidepressants and a variety \nof antiepileptic drugs as gabapentin and pregabalin, which is preferred because of \nits better bioavailability [52]. Concerning the antidepressants, international guide-\nlines provide the same level of recommendation for nonselective tricyclic antide-\npressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Most clinical \ntrials showed that the efficacy of SNRIs is lower than that of tricyclic antidepres-\nsants. However, tricyclic antidepressants have more side effects in elderly and are \ncontraindicated in patients with glaucoma, prostate hypertrophy or some cardiac \nconduction disturbances. Venlafaxine is a SNRI who has shown efficacy in painful \npolyneuropathies of different origins [53]. In CTD, PN is mainly due to vasculitic \nFigure 2. \nSclerosis of the face in systemic sclerosis.\n9Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue Diseases\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271\nand immune abnormalities. So when vasculitic neuropathy is diagnosed, cortico-\nsteroids should be promptly introduced to recover sensory and motor deficits [3]. \nMost authors recommend starting oral prednisone at high dose of 1 mg/kg per day. \nIn severe cases, intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone of one 1 g for 3–5 days \nmight be appropriate for initial treatment. This treatment should be maintained \nduring the subacute phase, and after 6 to 8 weeks, the treatment should be tapered \nprogressively. Immunosuppressant therapy is associated to corticosteroids in severe \nforms of vasculitic neuropathy or in systemic vasculitic PN. Cyclophosphamide \nseems to be the most effective drug for induction of remission and improvement of \nsurvival in non-viral systemic vasculitides [18]. Most patients need 3–12 months of \ncyclophosphamide induction therapy before they can be switched to a maintenance \nimmunosuppressant [54]. Immunosuppressant used as a maintenance therapy is \nazathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil [55]. Intravenous immuno-\nglobulin is a safe treatment used in serious systemic PN with clinical benefit [18].\n7.2 Particularities of treatment in each CTD\nTherapeutic strategies of small fibre neuropathy in SS are still unclear. \nCarbamazepine is generally the first-line agent for trigeminal neuralgia.

[60].\nDemystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions\n10\nof other antiepileptic agents such as gabapentin should be prescribed with slow \ntitration to minimize its side effects particularly over somnolence and fatigue. \nThe duration of therapeutic trial should be at least 3 months. The secondary \namine tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline and desipramine have fewer \nanticholinergic side effects and a proven efficacy in neuropathic pain, and so \nthey may be slowly prescribed in patients with SS. The use of new immunosup-\npressant agents mainly monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 antigen on \nB cells as rituximab and the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors such \nas adalimumab has been reported to be efficient in the small fibre neuropathies \noccurring in SS [25]. The management of axonal polyneuropathy is based on a \nsymptomatic treatment; corticosteroids and immunosuppressors are discussed \nin the case of motor neuropathy with rapid progression [25]. In the case of \nmultiple mononeuropathy, the presence of vasculitis is associated with a good \nresponse to immunosuppressive therapy [34]. There is evidence supporting the \nuse of immunoglobulin therapy in Sjögren-associated sensorimotor and non-\nataxic sensory neuropathy from retrospective and observational cohorts and case \nreports [56, 57].\nIn SLE, there are no clear guidelines on the treatment of peripheral neuropathy. \nInduction treatments with glucocorticoids with or without immunosuppressant \nagents are indicated in the situation of active vasculitic neuropathy [58]. In the case \nof necrotizing vasculitis, treatment with plasmapheresis, steroids and immunosup-\npressant has led to improvement [59, 60]. The definitions of response to treatment \nare variable between studies. Overall, the rate of global response (complete or \npartial) is more than 50% [41] (Table 3).\nIn SSc, there is not enough data regarding the response of scleroderma-associated \nneuropathy to immunosuppression [11, 61]. However, this therapy seems to be \neffective in mononeuritis multiplex and sensorimotor polyneuropathy with inflam-\nmatory process [11]. In DM/PM the treatment of PN is based on corticosteroids and \nimmunosuppressant agents depending on the severity of the clinic presentation [51].\nPNS, peripheral nervous system; SNRI, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake \ninhibitors; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulins; PEX, plasma exchange; GBS, \nGuillain-Barré syndrome.\n8. Conclusion\n8.1 Final considerations\nPN is one of the possible neurologic manifestations encountered by physi-\ncians in CTD. Coexistence of both conditions is explained by immune-mediated \nfactors particularly a vasculitis of peripheral nerve. Therefore, it is important to \ntake a detailed medical history and examination and then adequate investigations \nto assess for an underlying systemic autoimmune diseases that may be associated \nwith the neuropathy. Pure sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies are the most \ncommon PN features in these disorders. Acute to subacutely evolving multifocal \nor asymmetric neuropathy suggests a vasculitic cause. This situation constitutes a \nprognostic factor of the disease and requires prompt treatment with steroids and \nimmunosuppressant agents. The treatment of PN in CTD progresses in three fronts: \nfirst, to identify the type of PN through the medical history and physical exam; \nsecond, to precise the pathogenic mechanism of neuropathy via clinical presenta-\ntion, electromyographic data and in unclear situation the nerve biopsy and finally, \nthe efficient control of pain. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for \nvasculitic neuropathy in CTD.\n11\n© 2018 The Author(s). Licensee IntechOpen.

Moreover, in the treatment approach of PN in CTD, we need \nfurther researches to identify curative drugs targeting the pathogenesis pathways \nrather than the symptomatic and the previous conventional therapy.\nConflict of interest\nThere is no conflict of interest.\nAuthor details\nMouna Snoussi*, Faten Frikha and Zouhir Bahloul\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Sfax, Tunisia\n*Address all correspondence to: mounasnoussi23@yahoo.fr\n12\nDemystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions\n[1] Kumar TS, Aggarwal A. Approach \nto a patient with connective tissue \ndisease.

"This study investigates the relationship between book-tax differences (BTDs) and earnings management, tax management, and their interactions in Chinese-listed companies. Using unique tax-effect BTDs obtained from Chinese B-share-listed firms, we find that firms with strong incentives for earnings and tax management exhibit high levels of abnormal BTDs. This suggests that BTDs can be used to capture both accounting and tax manipulations induced by managerial motivations. Our results indicate that earnings management explains 7.4% of abnormal BTDs, tax management accounts for 27.8% of abnormal BTDs, and their interaction explains 3.2% of abnormal BTDs. Tax-effect BTDs are more powerful than income-effect BTDs in capturing opportunistic reporting at both conceptual and empirical levels"

Matter in neutron star collisions can reach densities up to few times the nuclear saturation\nthreshold (ρ0 ' 2.7×1014 g cm−3) and temperatures up to one hundred MeV. Understanding the structure\nand composition of such matter requires many-body nonperturbative calculations that are currently highly\nuncertain. Unique constraints on the neutron star matter are provided by gravitational-wave observations\naided by numerical relativity simulations. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical conditions of\nmatter and radiation along the merger dynamics. We consider 3 microphysical equation of state models\nand numerical relativity simulations including an approximate neutrino transport scheme. The neutron\nstar cores collision and their multiple centrifugal bounces heat the initially cold matter to several tens of\nMeV. Streams of hot matter with initial densities ∼ 1−2ρ0 move outwards and cool due to decompression\nand neutrino emission. The merger can result in a neutron star remnant with densities up to 3− 5ρ0 and\ntemperatures ∼ 50 MeV. The highest temperatures are confined in an approximately spherical annulus\nat densities ∼ ρ0. Such temperatures favour positron-neutron capture at densities ∼ ρ0, thus leading to\na neutrino emission dominated by electron antineutrinos. We study the impact of trapped neutrinos on\nthe remnant matter’s pressure, electron fraction and temperature and find that it has a negligible effect.\nDisks around neutron star or black hole remnant are neutron rich and not isentropic, but they differ in\nsize, entropy and lepton fraction depending on the nature of the central object.

In the latter case, the cold, β-equilibrated matter of\nthe individual NSs at typical densities 1 of ρNS ∼ 2− 3ρ0\nis pushed to ρ ∼ 5 − 6ρ0 and temperatures up to T ∼\n50 − 100 MeV in the remnant (see e.g. [2,3,4]). Those\nextreme conditions are reached on a timescale of millisec-\nonds, and potentially differ from those of proto NS in su-\npernova remnants (e.g. [5]).\nOur knowledge of the properties of cold matter at\nsupranuclear densities are still affected by large uncertain-\nties, see e.g. [6,7]. Nevertheless they are key in determin-\nSend offprint requests to: albino.perego@unitn.it\n1 We consider here NSs of “fiducial” mass of MNS ∼ 1.35 −\n1.4 M\f.\ning the internal structure and mass-radius relation of NSs.\nDespite many theoretical effords, also the behavior of nu-\nclear matter at finite temperature is poorly known, see\ne.g. [8] and references therein. The first composition- and\ntemperature-dependent versions of the equation of state\n(EOS) widely used in simulations of binary NS mergers\nand core-collapse supernovae were the Lattimer-Swesty\n(LS) EOS [9] and the Shen EOS [10]. Most of the EOS\ncurrently used and compatible with present nuclear con-\nstraints are based on the relativistic mean field (RMF)\napproach [8]. However, more realistic EOSs based on de-\ntailed microscopic interactions and many-body techniques\nare becoming available, e.g. [11].\nA detailed knowledge of the matter interactions in the\nmerger remnant is pivotal for characterizing the dynamics\nand the related gravitational and electromagnetic radia-\ntion signatures. For example, tidal interactions during the\ninspiral are parametrized by NS compactness and EOS-\ndependent tidal polarizability coefficients [12,13,14,15,16,\n17]; the properties of the merger dynamics dependent pri-\nar\nX\niv\n:1\n90\n3.\n07\n89\n8v\n1 \n [g\nr-q\nc] \n 19\n M\nar \n20\n19\n2 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\nmarily on those coefficients [18,19]. Moreover, the maxi-\nmum mass of nonrotating NS supported by the EOS deter-\nmines the threshold for the prompt gravitational collapse\nof the remnant [20,21]. Similarly, the EOS characterizes\nthe remnant NS, the disk, the ejecta, and the neutrino\nemission properties (e.g. [22,4]), thus influencing the nu-\ncleosynthesis and ultimately the properties of the kilonova\nemission [4,23]. The timescale for the gravitational col-\nlapse to a black hole, as well as the mass and the lifetime\nof the disk, can also play a pivotal role in launching a rel-\nativistic jet and producing a (short) gamma-ray burst,\nsee e.g. [24,25,26,27]. The appearance of phase transi-\ntions and extra degrees of freedom, including hyperons\nand quarks, can soften the EOS in the merger remnant\nleading to collapse and/or signatures in the gravitational\nwaves (GWs) signal [2,28,29,30].\nNR simulations are the only means to build models\nand to interpret the observations that set constraints on\nthe NS properties and thus on the EOS. The measurement\nof tidal polarizability parameters in the GW170817 signal\nconstrained the EOS at ρ . ρNS, e.g. [31,32,33,34]. NR\nsimulations support the development of tidal waveform\nmodels for such measurement, e.g. [35,17,36,37,38]. Sim-\nilarly, the post-merger signal from the remnant, although\nnot detected in GW170817 [39], could also place strong\nconstraints on the physics at extreme densities ρ . 5−6ρ0\n[40,41,42,28,43,44].\nSimulations results combined with the ejecta proper-\nties inferred from AT2017gfo (the kilonova associated with\nGW170817) led to upper bounds on the maximum mass\nof NS by noticing that the energy of the ejecta inferred\nfrom optical and infrared data are likely incompatible with\nboth a prompt collapse and a long lived remnant [45] (see\nalso [46,47,48]). Similar arguments, combined with em-\npirical relations between NS radii and the threshold mass\nfor prompt collapse mentioned above, tentatively rule out\nEOSs predicting very small NS radii [49]. The correlation\nbetween the disk mass and the tidal polarizability param-\neter observed in NR simulations can complement the con-\nstraints on the tidal coefficients in joint observation of GW\nand electromagnetic (EM) radiation [22,50].\nIn this work we study in details the thermodynami-\ncal conditions of matter and radiation during binary NS\n(BNS) mergers. We explore three microphysical EOS mod-\nels by simulating the matter flow along the general rela-\ntivistic merger dynamics and including weak interactions.\nOur work aims at quantitatively investigating the typical\ndensities, temperatures, and electron fractions that can be\nreached in real astrophysical mergers and their intrinsic\nvariability. We also explore the properties and the poten-\ntial role of a gas of dynamically trapped neutrinos deep\ninside the merger remnant. We finally point out the ro-\nbust features and some of the main uncertainties of cur-\nrent state-of-art simulations.\nThe paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we\npresent the EOSs employed in this work, the NR simu-\nlations setups, and the method used for the analysis of\nthe neutrino trapped components. Section 3 is devoted to\nthe presentation of the thermodynamical conditions expe-\nrienced by the astrophysical plasma as obtained by several\nBNS merger models, characterized by different EOSs, NS\nmasses and physical ingredients (e.g. turbulent viscosity).\nIn Section 4 we report the results of the analysis of the\nrole of trapped neutrinos, while in Section 5 we discuss\nthe properties of disks in BNS merger remnants. Finally,\nwe conclude in Section 6.\n2 Method\nWe consider three different nuclear EOS models: HS(DD2)\n[53,54], LS220 [9], and HS(SFHo) [55], see Tab. 1 (in the\nfollowing, we will refer to the first and third ones simply as\nDD2 and SFHo, respectively). The LS220 EOS is based on\na liquid droplet Skyrme model with a value of 220 MeV for\nthe modulus of the nuclear incompressibility. It includes\nsurface effects and models α-particles as an ideal, classi-\ncal, non-relativistic gas. Heavy nuclei are treated using the\nso-called single nucleus approximation (SNA). The DD2\nand SFHo EOSs combine a statistical ensemble of sev-\neral thousands of nuclei, under the assumption of nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium (NSE), with a RMF approach for\nthe unbound nucleons to treat high-density nuclear mat-\nter [54]. The phase transition from nuclei to homogeneous\nnuclear matter at densities close to nuclear saturation den-\nsity is achieved by an excluded volume mechanism. DD2\nand SFHo use different parameterizations and values for\nmodeling the mean-field nuclear interactions. In partic-\nular, DD2 uses a linear, but density dependent coupling\n[53], while the RMF parametrization of SFHo is motivated\nby neutron star radius measurements from low-mass X-ray\nbinaries ([55] and references therein).\nAll three models have symmetry energies at saturation\ndensity within experimental bounds. LS220 has a signifi-\ncantly steeper density dependence of its symmetry energy\nthan the other models. In all models, the finite temper-\nature behavior of the EOS is mainly determined by the\nnucleon effective mass, m∗N , with smaller effective masses\nleading to higher temperatures for constant entropy. The\nLS220 EOS assumes that the nucleon mass is the bare\nnucleon mass at all densities, while SFHo has m∗N/mN =\n0.76 at saturation density, and DD2 has m∗N/mN = 0.56,\nwhere mN is the bare nucleon mass.\nThese EOSs predict NS maximum masses and radii\nwithin the range allowed by current astrophysical con-\nstraints, including the recent LIGO-Virgo constraint on\ntidal deformability [31,32,34,33]. SFHo, LS220, and DD2\nsupport 2.06, 2.06, and 2.42 M\f cold, non-rotating max-\nimum NS masses. The cold, non-rotating NS radius cor-\nresponding to 1.4 M\f is R1.4 = 11.9, 12.7, 13.2 km re-\nspectively. Since NS radii correlate with the pressure at\nroughly twice saturation density [6], we refer to EOS hav-\ning smaller R1.4 as being “softer” and to EOS having\nlarger R1.4 as being stiffer. In Tab. 1 we summarize the\nmain nuclear properties of the cold EOS models used in\nthis work.\nFor each EOS model, irrotational BNS configurations\nin quasi-circular orbit are computed by solving the gen-\neral relativistic initial data problem.

The EOS used for the initial\ndata are constructed from the minimum temperature slice\n(T ∼ 0.5 − 0.1 MeV) of the EOS table used for the evo-\nlution assuming neutrino-less beta-equilibrium. To create\nthe initial data tables we also subtract from the pressure\nthe contribution of photon radiation, which dominates at\nthe lowest densities due to the assumption of constant\ntemperature. Initial data properties are summarized in\nTab. 2.\nThe initial data are evolved according to Einstein’s\ngeneral relativistic equations for the spacetime in the (3+1)D\nform described in [57,58] and coupled to general rela-\ntivistic hydrodynamics. The (3+1)D simulations span the\nmerger and the remnant evolution for a timescale of at\nleast 20-30 ms. We use the WhiskyTHC code [59,36,60,61];\nall the technical details are given in [23]. All simulations\ninvolving the LS220 EOS and simulation DD2 M136136\nare reported here for the first time. All our simulations do-\nmain covers a cube of 3,024 km in diameter whose center is\nat the center of mass of the binary. Our code uses Berger-\nOliger conservative adaptive mesh refinement (AMR; [62])\nwith sub-cycling in time and refluxing [63,64] as provided\nby the Carpet module of the Einstein Toolkit [65]. We\nsetup an AMR grid structure with 7 refinement levels. The\nfinest refinement level covers both NSs during the inspi-\nral and the remnant after the merger, and has a typical\nresolution of h ' 185 m.\nFor a subset of binaries, we use the general-relativistic\nlarge eddy simulations method (GRLES; [66]) to explore\nthe impact of subgrid-scale turbulent angular momentum\ntransport. The turbulent viscosity is parametrized as σT =\n`mixcs, where cs is the sound speed, and `mix is a free pa-\nrameter that sets the intensity of the turbulence. In the\ncontext of accretion disk theory turbulent viscosity is usu-\nally expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant α re-\nlated to `mix through the relation `mix = α csΩ\n−1, where\nΩ is the angular velocity of the fluid [67]. Recently, very\nhigh resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynam-\nics simulations of a NS merger were reported by [68], who\nused sufficiently high seed magnetic fields (1015 G) to re-\nsolve the MRI in the merger remnant. Averaged α values\nfor different rest-mass density shells were also provided.\nIn our models, we combine values of cs and Ω directly\nobtained during the simulations with their estimate of α\nto compute `mix as a function of density.\nThe high temperatures reached during the merger lead\nto the copious production of neutrinos of all flavors. Elec-\ntron (anti)neutrino production rates due to electron and\npositron captures on free protons and neutrons, respec-\ntively, are characterized by a T 5 dependence on matter\ntemperature (e.g., [69]). Thermal processes producing all\nkinds of neutrinos have an even stronger dependence,∼ T 7\n(e.g., [70]). For densities in excess of ρlim ∼ 1012g cm−3\nand temperatures above a few MeV, the neutrino mean\nfree path becomes smaller than the typical length scales\nof the system, and the diffusion timescale significantly ex-\nceeds the dynamical timescales. Under these conditions,\nneutrino trapping occurs and neutrinos form a gas ther-\nmally and dynamically coupled with the baryonic fluid.\nDiffusing neutrinos are eventually emitted at the last scat-\ntering surface (also called neutrino surface), located at a\ndensity close to ρlim, and propagate further in optically\nthin conditions.\nThe compositional and energy changes in the matter\ndue to weak reactions during the simulations are treated\nusing a leakage scheme that tracks reactions involving elec-\ntron νe and anti-electron type ν¯e neutrinos separately [71,\n72]. Heavy-lepton neutrinos are treated as a single effective\nspecies labeled as νx. The reactions included in the simula-\ntions are listed in Tab. 3; the precise formulas implemented\nfor neutrino production and absorption rates and for scat-\ntering opacities can be found in the references listed there.\nThe total neutrino opacities are used to compute an es-\ntimate to the optical depth following the scheme of [73].\n4 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\nTable 3. Weak reaction rates and references for their imple-\nmentation. We use the following notation: ν ∈ {νe, ν¯e, νx}\ndenotes a neutrino species, νx any heavy-lepton neutrinos,\nN ∈ {n, p} denotes a nucleon, and A denotes a nucleus.\nReaction Ref.\nνe + n↔ p+ e− [78]\nν¯e + p↔ n+ e+ [78]\ne+ + e− → ν + ν¯ [74]\nγ + γ → ν + ν¯ [74]\nN +N → ν + ν¯ +N +N [79]\nν +N → ν +N [74]\nν +A→ ν +A [80]\nThe optical depth and local opacity are then employed\nto calculate the neutrino diffusion timescale, as described\nin [74,4]. The neutrino emission rate from optically thick\nregions is then computed as the ratio between the local\nneutrino densities and the diffusion timescale. For the for-\nmer quantity, we assume that the neutrinos follow Fermi-\nDirac distributions with chemical potentials obtained as-\nsuming beta-equilibrium with thermalized neutrinos as in\n[69]. Free-streaming neutrinos are emitted at an average\nenergy and then evolved according to the M0 scheme in-\ntroduced in [72,4]. The M0 scheme is less sophisticated\nthat the frequency-integrated M1 scheme adopted by oth-\ners [75,76]. However, it is has the advantage of computa-\ntional efficiency, it incorporates an approximate treatment\nof gravitational and Doppler effects, and is well adapted to\nthe geometry found in NS mergers. In particular, it is not\naffected by the well-known radiation shock artifact that\nplagues the M1 scheme [77].\n2.1 Modelling of trapped neutrinos\nDespite the fact that trapped neutrino density is employed\nto compute emission rates from optically thick regions,\nthe neutrino treatment adopted in our simulations does\nnot explicitly model the presence of a trapped component.\nThe temperature- and composition-dependent weak equi-\nlibrium that establishes between the baryonic and leptonic\nfluids for ρ & ρlim could potentially change the matter\nproperties at those densities. For example, we presently\nneglects the pressure and internal energy contributions,\nas well as possible changes in the electron fraction, due to\nthe presence of these neutrino gases.\nIn order to explore this effect and to assess its rele-\nvance, we postprocess the results of our simulations by\ncomputing the thermodynamical conditions of the fluid in\npresence of a neutrino gas in weak and thermal equilib-\nrium. For consistency with the underlying simulations, we\nconsider (anti)neutrino of all flavors modelled as three in-\ndependent species: νe, ν¯e, and νx. Since neutral current\nreactions involving νx-ν¯x pairs decouple at significantly\nlarger densities than charged current reactions involving\nνe and ν¯e, we distinguish between ρlim,e = 5× 1011g cm−3\nfor both νe and ν¯e, and ρlim,x = 5 × 1012g cm−3 for νx.\n2 We first promote the electron fraction and the internal\nenergy density obtained by the simulations and measured\nin the local comoving frame to the lepton and total (i.e.,\nfluid+neutrinos) internal energy density:\nYe,sim → Yl\nesim → u .\nIndeed, the leakage scheme prescriptions evolve the lepton\nfraction and total internal energy, rather than the electron\nfraction and the fluid internal energy (see, e.g., [81]). For a\ngiven matter density ρ, the electron fraction and the fluid\nenergy obtained in the simulations univocally identify a\ntemperature through the EOS, Tsim. We then compute\nthe electron fraction and the temperature at equilibrium,\n(Ye,eq, Teq) , solving the following set of equations:\nYl = Ye,eq + Yνe(Ye,eq, Teq)− Yν¯e(Ye,eq, Teq) (1)\nu = e(Ye,eq, Teq) +\nρ\nmb\n[Zνe(Ye,eq, Teq)+\n+ Zν¯e(Ye,eq, Teq) + 4Zνx(Teq)] (2)\n0 = ηνe(Ye,eq, Teq)− ηe(Ye,eq, Teq) +\n−ηp(Ye,eq, Teq) + ηn(Ye,eq, Teq) . (3)\nIn the previous equations, Yνi and Zνi represent the\nneutrino particle and energy fractions, respectively, while\nηi = µi/T is the degeneracy parameter for the i species.\nThey are computed assuming weak and thermal equilib-\nrium between all the modelled species. The former is en-\nsured by the equilibrium relationship between the rela-\ntivistic chemical potentials µ, i.e. µνe = µe+µp−µn. The\nlatter is given by the assumption that the neutrino and\nmatter temperature coincide. In particular, we compute\nYνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =\n4pimb\nρ(hc)3\n(kBT )\n3\nF2(ηνi) exp\n(\n−ρlim,i\nρ\n)\n(4)\nZνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =\n4pimb\nρ(hc)3\n(kBT )\n4\nF3(ηνi) exp\n(\n−ρlim,i\nρ\n)\n(5)\nwhere Fk(x) is the Fermi function of order k, and we fur-\nther assume that µν¯e = −µνe and µνx = 0. The density\ndependent exponential term ensures that trapped neutri-\nnos are only present for ρ & ρlim (see e.g. [82]). Trapped\nneutrinos do provide a pressure as an ultra-relativistic gas,\ni.e. Pν = (ρZν)/(3mb). We thus compare the pressure ob-\ntained in the simulation,\nPsim ≡ Pfluid(ρ, Ye,sim, Tsim) , (6)\nwith the total pressure at equilibrium,\nPeq ≡ Pfluid(ρ, Ye,eq, Teq) +\n+\nρ\n3\n(Zνe + Zν¯e + 4Zνx) (Ye,eq, Teq) . (7)\n3 Thermodynamical evolution\nWe now discuss results for the four fiducial binary neu-\ntron star mergers reported in Tab. 2. The binaries have\n2 Note that we do not include the presence of a scattering\natmosphere, which could be relevant for νx neutrinos.\nAlbino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 5\nFig. 1. Evolution of the maximum rest-mass density (top) and of the maximum temperature (bottom) for all the binaries\nconsidered in this work. Peak temperatures correspond the first bounce of the NS cores, and are reached at typical densities\nρ ∼ ρ0. Collapse to black hole happens for LS220 M135135 and SFHo M135135; during collapse the maximum density reaches\n(max ρ) & 5ρ0.\nmasses and EOS compatible with GW170817 [31] and, cor-\nrespondingly, the maximal densities in each NS are 2− 3\ntimes the nuclear saturation point, ρNS1,2 ∼ 2− 3ρ0, with\nsofter EOS having larger maximum densities.\nThe maximum density and temperature evolutions for\neach model are reported in Fig. 1. The moment t = 0 cor-\nresponds to the peak of the gravitational-wave amplitude\n(i.e. the end of the chirp signal) and it is conventionally\nrefereed as moment of merger (or shortly merger, where it\ncannot be confused with the merger-phase of the coales-\ncence) [17]. During the last orbits (t < 0) the maximum\ndensity and temperature are approximately constant, the\nlatter being T ∼ 10 MeV. These high temperature are\nreached close to the surface of the stars and are a numer-\nical artifact.\nAt t ∼ 0 the two NS cores merge, the maximum den-\nsity increases rapidly up to ∼ 1.5ρNS and temperature in-\ncreases due to (physical) hydrodynamical shocks and mat-\nter compression. In the considered binaries, no prompt\ncollapse happens and the two NS cores bounce multiple\ntimes on a timescale of few milliseconds. During the first\nof these bounces, the temperature peaks at 70− 100 MeV\nand most of the dynamical ejecta is expelled [83,84,4]. The\ncore bounces are more violent in binaries with softer EOS,\nand produce larger density and temperature oscillations.\nNote that binary remnants are closer to the gravitational\ncollapse instability point for softer EOSs [1,85,86]. Hot\nmaterial from the collisional interface between the NSs is\nsqueezed out of the remnant and settles into an accretion\ndisk [4]. The remnant is still deformed into a bar (m = 2\nmode) and spiral arms are launched inside the disk. On\na timescale of 10 − 20 ms, the characteristic timescale of\nthe GW transient, binaries with softer EOS collapse to\na rotating black hole with typical dimensionless Kerr pa-\nrameter of ∼ 0.7 − 0.8 [3,19]. Binaries with stiffer EOS\ngenerate long-lived NS remnants whose dynamics is de-\ntermined on timescales much longer than those presently\nsimulated in numerical relativity [23].\nLet us discuss the thermodynamical conditions expe-\nrienced by the matter during the different phases of the\nmerger. For the moment, we do not include the effect of\ntrapped neutrinos at ρ > ρlim, but we simply consider the\noutcome of our simulations. Under the assumption that\nmatter is always in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE),\nwe focus on matter density, ρ, temperature, T , and elec-\ntron fraction, Ye. We consider 3D spatial hypersurfaces at\nspecific coordinate times and produce histograms of the\nbaryonic-mass as distributed at different ρ, T , and Ye, i.e.\nMb(ρ, T, Ye). We used the following ranges:\nρ ∈ [104, 1016] g cm−3\nT ∈ [10−2, 102] MeV\nYe ∈ [0, 0.5] ,\nbinning them in 120 × 50 × 50 intervals. For the density\nand temperature, the bins are uniformly displaced in the\nlogarithm, while we use a linear scale for the electron frac-\ntion. The artificial atmosphere of the simulations is set to\ndensity level ρatm ∼ 104 g cm−3. Similar plots have been\npresented in [87,88] for core-collapse supernova simula-\ntions, in [29,89] for BNS mergers, and in [90] for BNS\nmerger aftermath 3. However, a detailed discussion is, to\nthe best of our knowledge, missing in the literature.\n3 Note the LS220 simulations presented here are a longer and\nhigher resolution versions of those shown in [89].\n6 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\nThe five rows of Figs. 2-6 4 refer to snapshots covering\nthe entire available binary evolution. Moving from top to\nbottom: (1) early time during the orbital phase, (2) the\ntime corresponding to the temperature peak, (3) about\n3-4 milliseconds after the temperature peak, (4) a later\ntime close to collapse (if collapse happens), (5) time close\nto simulation end. Each row shows a snapshot of rest-\nmass density on the orbital plane and two thermodynam-\nical condition histograms in which two of three variables\n((ρ, T ) and (ρ, Ye), respectively) are shown and the third\nis integrated over its range.\nDuring the last orbits (snapshots (1)) most of the baryon\nmass is clearly distributed around the maximum NS densi-\nties at T ∼ 1−3 MeV, with an electron fraction still close\nto the cold, ν-less weak equilibrium, 0.01 . Ye . 0.12. In\nall models we recognize the typical increase of Ye moving\nfrom ρ ∼ ρ0 to a few times ρ0 due to the increase in the\nsymmetry energy. The highest temperatures are reached\nat densities ρ ∼ 1012g cm−3, but as mentioned above this\nis a numerical artifact.\nAfter merger (t & 0, snaphshots (2)), the innermost\npart of the merging cores, ρ & ρNS, does not experience\nviolent shocks (s . 1 kB baryon−1, where s is the spe-\ncific matter entropy). Thus the increase of the maximum\ndensity in the center of the remnant is associated with a\nmarginal increase in the temperature (up to a few tens\nof MeV), mainy due to matter compression of degenerate\nnuclear matter well above nuclear saturation density. In-\ndeed, most of the matter in the cores resides below the\nsemi-degenerate transition line represented by\nT = TF(ρ) =\n~2\n2mb\n(\n3pi2ρ\nmb\n)2/3\n, (8)\nwhere TF is the Fermi temperature of an ideal baryon gas\nof mass mb. At merger (t ∼ 0) the electron fraction at the\nhighest densities is still frozen to the initial ν-less, cold\nweak equilibrium value. Due to the high opacities of these\nregions during and after the merger, Ye does not change\nsignificantly on the simulated timescale due to the emis-\nsion of neutrinos. Only later, when the cores experience a\nsignificant compression and mixing, the Ye profiles become\nmore uniform for ρ & ρNS.\nOn the contrary, the densities at which T peaks cor-\nrespond to the regions close to the binary center of mass\nwhere shocks are generated and material is pushed out-\nwards (snaphshots (2)-(3)). The highest temperatures are\nreached at densities slightly below ρNS and characterized\nby the lowest Ye. In particular, the DD2 model peaks at\n∼ 70 MeV, LS220 at ∼ 80 MeV, and SFHo at ∼ 100 MeV.\nThis matter, initially located in the outer layers of the two\ncores, expands into the spiral arms. The temperature low-\ners as the spiral-arms expand and decompress, forming an\nenvelope around the merging cores. As a consequence of\nthe fast expansion, the temperature drops to ∼ 10 MeV\nas the density reaches a few times 1013 g cm−3 (snapshot\n4 Time-dependent (animated) versions can be found at\nhttp://www.computational-relativity.org/.\n(3)). The EOS is dominated by the non-degenerate nu-\ncleons (T & TF) and the matter expanding adiabatically\nsatisfies the relation T 3/ρ2 ≈ const 5.\nIn terms of the spatial distribution of ρ and T , the\nmerging cores have a peculiar structure with two rotat-\ning hot spots, displaced by an angle of ∼ pi/2 with re-\nspect to the densest regions corresponding to the NS cores\n(e.g. [91]). The expansion of the spiral arms, in combi-\nnation with their fast orbital motion, produces a disk\nstructure around the forming massive NS. The fast mo-\ntion of the merging cores and of spiral arms inside this\nnewly formed envelope heats it up, mainly via shocks.\nThe subsequent increase of entropy determines a spread\nin the ρ− T diagram. The EOS is dominated by the non-\nrelativistic baryons, T ∝ (exp (2s)/ρ2)1/3 (see, e.g., [92])\nand matter experiences a temperature increase up to a\nfew tens of MeV (snapshots (3) and (4)). This behaviour\nexplains the peak structure and evolution observed in the\nρ − T diagram, where a maximum temperature of a sev-\neral tens of MeV is reached by a substantial amount of\nmatter with density around or immediately below nuclear\nsaturation density. The corresponding electron fraction is\nsignificantly larger (∼ 0.05-0.10) than the low Ye expected\nfrom ν-less, cold weak equilibrium (. 0.05). This is only\npartially due to an excess of electron antineutrinos emis-\nsion (see below), while it traces back the origin of this\nmatter to larger densities where the increase of the sym-\nmetry energy produces larger Ye already in ν-less weak\nequilibrium conditions.\nShocks inside the disk produce further matter expan-\nsion (snaphshots (3)-(5)). As soon as the density drops\nbelow 1010g cm−3 and the temperature becomes of the\norder of a few MeV, the EOS is dominated by the rela-\ntivistic electrons and photons. Thus, adiabatic expansion\nfollows the relation T 3/ρ ≈ const ∝ s, typical of ultrarel-\nativistic gases.\nIf the forming massive NS does not collapse (as in\nthe DD2 case, Fig. 2), the cores completely merge on a\ntimescale of several ms and the hot spots become a spher-\nical annulus at an intermediate density ∼ ρ0 between the\ndenser core and the more diluite envelope, see Fig. 8. Since\nthis time interval corresponds to several orbital timescales,\nthe envelope around the remnant has reached a relatively\nhomogeneous configuration and the spread in the ρ − T\nplane has significantly reduced. Moreover, an inspection\nof the ρ−Ye planes reveals the effect of weak reactions on\nthe disk composition: at the location where the last scat-\ntering neutrino surface is expected to be (ρ ∼ ρlim), the\ncaptures of positrons and streaming νe on free neutrons\nsignificantly increases the electron fraction.\nOn the other hand, if a black hole forms (as in the\nLS220 and SFHo cases, see the fifth row of Figs. 3-6), the\nevolution of the thermodynamical conditions inside the\n5 Thermodynamics’ first principle for an adiabatic trasfor-\nmation of an ideal gas in a volume V is dU/V = +pdρ/ρ with\nU the internal energy and dU ∝ dT . For a non-relativistic\ngas P = 2/3 U/V and for a relativisitc gas P = 1/3 U/V .\nHence, in the former case d lnT = 2/3 d ln ρ, and in the latter\nd lnT = 1/3 d ln ρ.\nAlbino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 7\nremnant changes substantially. Within a ms, the forma-\ntion of an apparent horizon removes all the high density\npart of the system, down to densities of 1012g cm−3, leav-\ning a rather cold disk (T . 10MeV) with a significantly\nreprocessed electron fraction, i.e. Ye ∼ 0.25.\nIn Fig. 7, we present histograms of the thermodynam-\nical conditions from the third and fifth snaphshots for all\nthe models presented in Figs. 2-6, binned in density and\nspecific entropy, s. For the latter, we consider 50 logarith-\nmically spaced bins in the interval\ns ∈ [0.1, 100] kBbaryon−1.\nFor all models, the cold unshocked cores are characterized\nby the presence of low entropy material (s . 2 kBbaryon−1)\nfor matter densities in excess of a few times ρ0. Matter\nsqueezed by the merging cores and expanding inside the\nforming disk is subjects to intense hydrodynamical shocks\nthat increase matter entropy up to a few kB baryon\n−1.\nThe combined effect of matter expansion and shocks re-\nsulting from the repeated core bounces produces a tran-\nsient phase where the envelope engulfing the cores has a\nlarge spread in entropy (see, for example, the left panel of\nthe DD2 M136136 cases). However, on a timescale of a few\ndynamical periods, the action of the spiral arms on the in-\nnermost part of the disk increases the entropy of the colder\nstreams, producing a tighter correlation between the mat-\nter density and entropy. The bulk of the remnant outside\nthe merging cores has 2 < s\n[\nkB baryon\n−1] . 10 for mat-\nter density decreasing from 1014 down to 1010 g cm−3.\nLooking at the matter distribution inside this density in-\nterval, we conclude that softer EOSs present a remnant\ncharacterized by larger values of the entropy (i.e. ∆s ∼\n2 kBbaryon\n−1). This is a consequence of the stronger shocks\nthat characterize more violent mergers from more compact\nNSs. If the EOS is stiffer and the massive NS survives long\nenough, shock expansion inside the low density part of the\ndisk increases its entropy, up to 20 kBbaryon\n−1. On the\nother hand, if a black hole forms, the lack of a persistent\nsource of shocks partially prevents the disk from reaching\na tight ρ−s correlation (as visible in the LS220 and SFHo\nequal mass cases).\nApart from the differences due to the different fates of\nthe remnant, all five fiducial models show a similar quali-\ntative behavior, and the major features described above do\nnot depend on the specific EOS nor on the binary mass ra-\ntio. Nevertheless, quantitative differences and temporary\nfeatures can be noticed depending on the specific model.\nTemperature and entropy are, on average, larger for mod-\nels employing a softer EOS. This is a results of the more vi-\nolent collision that characterize more compact NSs. Mod-\nels employing turbulent viscosity show immediately after\nmerger a larger spread in the density-temperature his-\ntogram, as well as in the density-entropy one. However,\nthey require less time to produce disks with homogeneous\nproperties. In the asymmetric model LS220 M140120, the\ncores merge in a very asymmetric way. In particular, the\ncore of the lighter NS is tidally deformed by the core of the\nheavier one and its matter is subject to a violent tempera-\nture increase during its decompression (see the second raw\nof Fig. 5). However, on a longer timescale, the outer part\nof the lighter core contributes to the formation of the hot\nenvelope around the merging cores and the evolution of\nall termodynamical quantities resembles the one of more\nsymmetric mergers.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that our histograms\ntrack the evolution of the dynamical ejecta in its differ-\nent components. Immediately after merger, a few ejec-\ntion episodes develops from matter with initially low tem-\nperature (a few MeV), low Ye (. 0.1), and low entropy\n(. 10kB). They expands very fast according to T 3/ρ2 ∼\nconst, down to densities at the edge of our domain. Positron\nand electron neutrino captures on free n increase Ye dur-\ning the expansion, but only marginally (Ye . 0.25). We\ntentatively identify this ejecta as the tidal component. Af-\nter ∼ 1 millisecond, ejection episodes are also visible from\nthe high-temperature part of our histograms (correspond-\ning to s & 10 kB baryon−1), expanding at the same rate.\nIn the T − Ye plane, this ejecta presents a much broader\ndistribution in Ye, up to Ye . 0.4. We identify this ejecta\nas the shock-driven one, whose polar component is more\nsignificantly influenced by neutrino absorption.\n4 Influence of neutrino trapping on matter\nWe now move to the discussion of the potential effect of\ntrapped neutrinos using the approached described in Sec-\ntion 2.1. We first re-write the expression of the neutrino\nfractions, Eqs. 4-5, in terms of the Fermi temperature,\nEq. 8, neglecting the exponential cut in density:\nYνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =\n3\n√\n2\n8\n(\nT\nTF\n)3/2 (\nkBT\nmbc2\n)3/2\nF2(ηνi) , (9)\nZνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =\n(\nkBT\nF3(ηνi)\nF2(ηνi)\n)\nYνi(ρ, Ye, T ) . (10)\nSince baryons are always non relativistic, kBT \u001c mbc2,\nsignificant neutrino fractions require high temepratures\nfor matter in non-degenerate conditions (T \u001d TF) and/or\nhighly degenerate neutrino conditions (ην \u001d 1).\nWe have repeated the analysis of the histrograms of\nthe thermodynamical conditions presented in Section 3 in-\ncluding the effects of trapped neutrinos for ρ > ρlim. Since\nthe variations in Ye and T are only minors (see below) and\nthe histograms present already a significant spread in all\nvariables, we conclude that the inclusion of trapped neutri-\nnos does not qualitatively changes our previous analysis.\nIn Fig. 9 we present the results of our post-processing\nanalysis for a snapshot of the DD2 M136136 simulation\ntaken ∼ 11 ms after merger (i.e. close to the peak tem-\nperature) along the equatorial plane. In the top panels,\nwe show the rest-mass density (left), matter temperature\n(middle) and electron fraction (right) as obtained by the\nsimulation. In the bottom panels, we present Yνe (left),\nYν¯e (middle), and Ye,sim − Ye,eq = Yνe − Yν¯e (right) as\nobtained in our post-processing analysis.\nDeep inside the remnant, where densities are in ex-\ncess of a few times nuclear saturation density, ρ & 3ρ0,\n8 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\nthe temperature is a few MeV high. Under such condi-\ntions, T \u001c TF (i.e. µi \u001d T for neutrons, protons, and\nelectrons, and thermal effects are negligible). Since mat-\nter conditions are still close to the initial cold, ν-less, weak\nequilibrium, we find |ηνi | . 3, and F2(ηνi) . 20 (see e.g.\n[93], appendix). Thus, the production of electron flavor\n(anti)neutrinos is suppressed and Ye,eq ≈ Ye,sim. Since\nYe . 0.1, neutrons are more degenerate than protons and\nany increase in temperature decreases more significantly\nµp than µn. Thus, ηνe . 0. This effect is partially com-\npensated by the increase of µe due to matter compression.\nOverall, we find that −3 . ηνe . −1, 10−6 . Yνe . 10−4,\n10−4 . Yν¯e . 10−3, and 10−6 . Yνx . 10−4, such that\nYνe < Yνx < Yν¯e locally.\nAt lower densities, 1014g cm−3 . ρ . 4× 1014g cm−3,\nthe temperature increases up to a few tens of MeV, due\nto the presence of the hot annulus outside the merging\ncores. While the electrons are still highly degenerate, the\nneutrons and (more significantly) the less abundant pro-\ntons becomes mildy degenerate (T & TF). The (negative)\nchemical potential of electron neutrinos decreases, but not\nthe neutrino degeneracy parameter, due to the higher tem-\nperatures: in this region we find that −2 . ηνe . −1. Un-\nder these conditions, a significant electron antineutrino gas\nforms Yν¯e ∼ 0.02, followed by Yνx . 0.01, while electron\nneutrinos are still suppressed by degeneracy (Yνe . 10−3).\nDue to the dominant presence of ν¯e, the initial Ye,sim\n(∼ 0.06) increases by Yν¯e , i.e. Ye,eq ≈ Ye,sim + Yν¯e , to\nguarantee lepton number conservation.\nAt densities below 1014g cm−3 the decrease in temper-\nature related with matter expansion produces less signif-\nicant deviations from the initial cold ν-less weak equilib-\nrium and all neutrino fractions become negligible inside\nthe cold (T . 10 MeV), unshocked streams. In particular,\nηνe & 1 and νe dominate over ν¯e. However, due to the\nlow temperatures, T < TF and Yνe ∼ 10−3. At the same\ntime, spiral arms moving inside this cold and less dense\nmatter produce shockes that heat-up matter at the arm\ninterfaces. Inside these regions, temperatures in excess of\n10 MeV for matter that decompresses down to a few times\n1012g cm−3 (thus, T ∼ several TF) lead to ηνe ∼ −1, pro-\nducing trapped neutrino gases with Yν¯e . 0.03, Yνx .\n0.01, and Yνe ∼ a few 10−3. As a results, Ye,eq increases\nwith respect to Ye,sim.\nThe appearance of a trapped neutrino gas is done at\nthe expences of the fluid internal energy, formed by rel-\nativistic electrons, positrons, photons, and non-relativistic\nbaryons. Since thermodynamical stability requires ∂e/∂T >\n0, Teq < Tsim. In the top panel of Fig. 10 we present the\nratio between the fluid pressure after and before the post-\nprocessing for the same configuration presented in Fig. 9.\nThe inclusion of trapped neutrinos reduces the tempera-\nture down to ∼93% of the simulation value in the hottest\nregions of the systems. Neutrinos are intrinsecally ultra-\nrelativistic and for them Pν ∝ Zν/3, while for a non-\nrelativistic ideal gas P ∝ 2e/3. Thus, we expect that their\nappearance decreases the total pressure and we quantify\nthe relative variation of the pressure to be . 0.04, in par-\nticular where the equatorial plane intersects the hot an-\nnulus outside the merging cores (as visible in the bottom\npanel of Fig. 10). Based on these results, the internal en-\nergy stored in the neutrino field is at most ∼8% of the\nfluid internal energy.\nEffects similar to the ones we have discussed for high\ndensity region (ρ & 1014g cm−3) in the equatorial plane\ncan be seen along any vertical plane passing through the\ncenter. However, far from the equatorial plane, the annu-\nlus structure involves matter at slightly lower density for\nwhich the decrease in the pressure due to the presence of\ntrapped neutrinos is slightly more significant (Peq/Psim ∼\n0.94).\nWe finally move to the analysis of trapped neutri-\nnos in the SFHo M135135 model. The former is charac-\nterized by larger maximum densities and temperatures,\nsee Fig. 1, and by a quick collapse of the central mas-\nsive NS. Before black hole formation, results of the neu-\ntrino post-processing analysis are qualitatively similar to\nthe DD2 M136136 case. Due to the larger temperatures\nreached during the NS collisions, the proton degeneracy\ndecrease is more pronunced and electron antineutrinos\ncan locally form a trapped gas with Yν¯e . 0.05, in par-\nticular where the cores collide and at the interface be-\ntween the spiral arms and the forming disk. The variation\nof the local pressure to the appearance of neutrinos can\nreach 10% of the simulation pressure. However, these large\ntemperatures are reached only immediately after merger,\nwhile during most of the evolution and for the bulk of the\nmatter, neutrino fractions are only marginally larger than\nthe ones observed in the DD2 M136136 model. After the\nformation of an apparent horizon, the maximum density\nand temperature significantly decrease inside the disk and\ntrapped neutrinos play no role inside the remnant.\n5 Disks around black holes or NS remnant\nThe analysis of the entropy distributions inside BNS merger\nremnants already revealed important differences between\nthe case in which a black hole promptly forms and that in\nwhich a massive NS survives for several dynamical time\nscales (end of Section 3). Further differences in the disk\nproperties are clearly visible in Figs. 11-13, where we present\nvolume rendering of the matter density, and three dimen-\nsional spatial distributions of entropy and electron frac-\ntion, for two simulations employing a stiffer (DD2 M136136,\nleft panels) and a softer (SFHo M135135, right panels)\nEOS, a few tens of milliseconds after merger.\nThe disk around the black hole produced at the end\nof the SFHo M135135 simulation is less massive and more\ncompact (i.e., with a significantly smaller spatial exten-\nsion and a steeper density profile) than the disk produced\noutside the massive NS by the DD2 M136136 simulation.\nMaximum densities in the former case reach only∼ 1012 g cm−3\nin a torus around the innermost stable circular orbit. On\nthe other hand, in the latter case the spatially more ex-\ntended disk has a continuously increasing density profile\nmoving towards the center that joins up with the massive\nNS density structure. The resulting disk is geometrically\nand optically thick to neutrinos (at least during the first\nAlbino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 9\ntens of ms). Fig. 12 confirms that a softer EOS produces\ndisks with larger entropies (possibly, ∆s ∼ 2 kBbaryon−1\n) due to the stronger shocks that develop at and after\nmerger. Neutrino irradiation from the center of the rem-\nnant changes the electron fraction above and inside the\ndisk. On the one hand, in both cases the innermost part\nof the disk retains its initial neutron richness, while the\nelectron fraction increases significantly above 0.3 in the\nlow density funnel above it. On the other hand, signifi-\ncant differences characterize Ye in the outer parts of the\ndisk. Due to the more extended, more diluite and colder\nstructure, the outer disk obtained in the DD2 run has a\nlower electron fraction than the more compact disk result-\ning from the SFHo run.\n6 Symmary and conclusions\nIn this paper, we analyzed the thermodynamical condi-\ntions experienced by matter during the merger of two NSs\nbased on the results of detailed hydrodynamical simula-\ntions in numerical relativity. Our five fiducial models in-\nclude the effect of finite-temperature, composition depen-\ndent nuclear EOSs in tabular form and of the emission of\nneutrinos via a three-species M0 that accounts for the re-\nabsorption of electron flavor (anti)neutrinos in optically\nthin conditions.\nWe explored three different hadronic EOSs: DD2, SFHo\nand LS220. The first two are based on the RMF approach\nand on a full distribution of nuclei in NSE, while the latter\nis based on a liquid droplet Skyrme model and, besides free\nneutrons and protons, includes α particles and one repre-\nsentative heavy nucleous. While most of our models refer\nto equal mass binaries, in one case we have investigate the\npotential impact of an asymmetric mass binary merger.\nMoreover, in three cases we have included the impact of\nsubgrid-scale turbulent angular momentum transport us-\ning the general-relativistic large eddy simulations method\n(GRLES; [66]).\nMatter stays cold and close to T = 0, ν-less weak equi-\nlibrium during the inspiral (the marginal increase of tem-\nperature at the NS surfaces is a numerical artifact). As\nsoon as the two NS cores touch and merge, the tempera-\nture increases by up to several tens of MeV for densities\nimmediately above nuclear saturation density. This is due\nto the development of hydrodynamical shockes at the in-\nterface between the bouncing cores that produce an hot\nmantle around the unshocked, merging bulks. The entropy\nin the cores stays below 2 kB baryon\n−1, while it increases\nto a few kB baryon\n−1 in the hot mantle. The action of\nrotating spiral arms on the forming disk increases tem-\nperature and entropy. At first, on a timescale comparable\nwith a few disk dynamical timescale, this produces a large\nspread in temperature and entropy. Later, over several\ndisk orbits, the conditions becomes more homogeneous.\nMatter expansion from the merging cores follows T 3/ρ2\nprofiles, typical of baryon-dominated matter that expands\nadiabatically. The more compact and dense NS cores asso-\nciated with softer EOS produce the largest densities and\ntemperatures. Asymmetric NS masses and the inclusion\nof turbulent viscosity have only a marginal impact on the\nthermodynamical properties.\nSince our simulations did not include the presence of\na trapped neutrino gas in thermal and weak equilibrium\nwith the fluid, we analyzed its potential impact in post-\nprocessing. We concluded that its inclusion can only marginally\naffect the local thermodynamical properties of dense mat-\nter above 1012g cm−3: the maximum temperature is re-\nduced by . 10%, while the introduction of neutrinos de-\ntermines a decrease in the total pressure . 5% and only\nin the hottest regions of the domain. Due to the initial\nneutron richness, deviations from cold, ν-less weak equi-\nlibrium due to an increase in temperature favor the pro-\nduction of electron antineutrinos over neutrinos.\nIf according to our results the inclusion of trapped neu-\ntrinos is not expected to significantly change the dynam-\nical properties of the remnant, the appearance of addi-\ntional degrees of freedom such as hyperons and quarks for\ndensities well above ρ0 could have a more significant im-\npact. BNS merger simulations performed with the BHBΛφ\nEOS model [94] (which is identical to DD2 apart for the\nappearance of hyperons at ρ & 2ρ0) present a qualita-\ntively different evolution of the remnant (see, e.g., [28]).\nHyperons in the BHBΛφ models soften the EOS and can\nlead to a fast collapse of the massive NS into a black hole,\nwhereas identical initial conditions evolved with the DD2\nEOS produce a stable rotating NS. For merging NSs with\nMNS . 1.35M\f the appearance of hyperons is expected\nonly after merger and mainly inside the cold, unshocked\ncores. If a black hole does not form, the qualitative be-\nhavior of the thermodynamical conditions is expected to\nbe very similar to the DD2 case, even if the stronger core\nbounces related with the EOS softening produce a hot-\nter remnant in the BHBΛφ than in the DD2 case. On\nthe other hand, in more massive NSs hyperons could be\npresent already during the inspiral phase and their frac-\ntion increases faster and more significantly during the\nearly post-merger phases. This can lead to hotter remnant\ndisks than the corresponding DD2 cases, if the massive NS\ncollapse to a black hole.\nThe possible appearance of muons (mµ ≈ 105.6 MeV)\nand mesons (e.g. pions, mpi ≈ 135−140 MeV) has been ex-\nplored, especially in cold NS matter, e.g. [95]. In this case,\ndegeneracy drives their production at densities well above\nρ0. During a BNS merger, if the temperature reaches sev-\neral tens of MeV in the hot envelope, they could also\nbe thermally produced at densities around or below ρ0.\nTheir inclusion in finite-temperature, composition depe-\ndent EOS is still missing and their potential impact on\nBNS mergers has not been explored yet.\nOur fiducial models allowed us to study the proper-\nties of disk forming in a BNS merger. We found that\nthe formation of a black hole in the center instead of a\nmassive NS leads to the most significant differences. In\nthe early BH formation case, the disk is usually hotter\n(due to the more violent NS collisions), more compact,\nand less dense (ρ . 1012g cm−3). However, the higher\ntemperatures and neutrino luminosities change its elec-\n10 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\ntron fraction more significantly. In the case in which a\nlong-lived remnant is formed, the disk is geometrically\nand optically thick, it is spatially more extended and has\nless steep density gradients, due to the prolonged action\nof the non-singular central object. Our post-processing\nanalysis of the trapped-neutrino gas could not directly\ninvestigate if the electron fraction of the matter form-\ning the disk is largely affected by the temporal transition\nto finite-temperature weak equilibrium conditions before\nquasi-adiabatic expansion. The reduced variation of Ye ob-\nserved for ρ & 1012g cm−3 seems to imply that this is not\nthe case and more significant changes in Ye are expected\ndue to the absorption of electrons and positrons, as weel\nas of νe and ν¯e on free baryons. This conclusions is qualita-\ntively consistent with results reported by BNS simulations\nincluding the contributions of trapped neutrinos, e.g. [75,\n76].\nFinally, the histograms of the thermodynamical condi-\ntions reported in [87,88] for CCSN simulations allow a di-\nrect comparison between the thermodynamical conditions\ninside CCSNe and BNS mergers. The electron fraction\nhas opposite trends inside these two scenarios. In CCSNe,\nsymmetric nuclear matter deleptonizes to reach neutron\nrich conditions inside the forming proto NS. Cold, ν-less\nweak equilibrium conditions are achieved only on the ν-\ncooling timescale (much larger than the dynamical and ex-\nplosion timescale). On the other hand, in BNS mergers the\ndecompression, heating, and neutrino irradiation of cold\nnuclear matter drive matter leptonization. This process\nis relevant to set the thermodynamical conditions of the\nejecta and, ultimately, its nucleosynthesis yields, e.g [90,\n96,97,75,72,98,99]. This fundamental difference reflects\nalso on the evolution of the density-temperature condi-\ntions. In CCSN simulations the presence of a single shock\nfront between the proto NS and the cold accreting flow\nchannels most of the hot mantle in a rather narrow band\nin the ρ − T plane. On the other hand, in BNS merg-\ners the combined presence of hydrodynamical compres-\nsion, tidal decompression, shocks and expansion produces\na much broader band that narrows over several dynamical\ntimescales. In CCSNe larger densities and temperatures\nare achieved for softer EOSs, but the mass of the pro-\ngenitor star is the most crucial parameter that influences,\nfor example, the maximum temperature reached during\nthe simulation. Indeed, densities of the order of a few ρ0\nare reached only after the proto NS formation and cooling,\nand the details of the nuclear interactions are of secondary\nimportance with respect to the strength of the gravita-\ntional field. In this work, we have only partially explored\nthe dependence on the colliding NS masses and, in partic-\nular, we did not consider very massive NSs. However, the\ndensities are significantly larger in NS mergers and the de-\ntails of the nuclear interactions influence more deeply the\ndynamics. Thus, the variability introduced by the different\nEOSs in NS merger models is compatible with the vari-\nability associated with different progenitors for CCSNe.\nWe might expect more variability in mergers with larger\nNS masses, however prompt collapse to black hole sets an\nintrinsic limit to the densities reached in the remnant.\nAcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Domenico Logoteta\nfor useful discussions.

Temperature distribution (MeV) in the massive NS\nproduced by the DD2 M1361364 binary at t = 34.2ms after\nthe merger. The surface of the massive NS is defined as the\npoint where the rest mass density ρ exceeds 1013g cm−3. Mate-\nrial at lower densities is made transparent in this visualization.\nMassive NSs produced in binary mergers are rotationally com-\npressed along the rotation axis (vertically in the figure). High\ntemperatures are confined to a spherical annulus at intermedi-\nate densities ∼1014g cm−3 formed of material originally at the\ncollisional interface between the NSs.\n20 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\nFig. 9.

Inside the merging cores, matter degeneracy\nprevents neutrino formation (TF \u001d T ). Only for shocked matter in semi-degenerate conditions engulfing the cores or developing\nat spiral arm interfaces, a significant ν¯e fractions develops.\nAlbino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 21\nFig. 10.

The formation of trapped neu-\ntrino gases converts fluid thermal energy into radiation energy,\nreducing matter temperature down to ∼92% of the simulation\nvalue. Since Pν ∝ Zν/3, the total pressure reduces down to\n∼94% of its original value.\n22 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers\nFig. 11. Volume rendering of the density of the postmerger remnant. Left panel: DD2 M13641364 at t = 34.2ms after the\nmerger. Right panel: SFHo M135135 at t = 17.2ms after the merger. Both image have the same spatial scale and show the data\nin a box of size ∼750 km. The black surface denotes the approximate location of the black hole horizon, which we identify as\nα = 0.3, being α the lapse function. Remnants harboring black holes at their centers, such as SFHo M135135, produce smaller,\ncompact disks, that are mostly transparent to neutrinos. Conversely, remnants having a massive NS at their center, have more\nmassive, geometrically and optically thick disks. At high latitudes, a low-density funnel is present in both cases.\nFig. 12. Entropy in kB per baryon of the postmerger remnant. Left panel: DD2 M136136 at t = 34.2ms after the merger. Right\npanel: SFHo M135135 at t = 17.2ms after the merger. We only show material with ρ ≥ 1011 g cm−3 corresponding the inner\nregions of Fig. 11. Note that here we are using two different spatial scales for the two images (c.f., Fig. 11). The black surface\ndenotes the approximate location of the black hole horizon, which we identify as α = 0.3, being α the lapse function. The cores\nof the merging NSs are not significantly shocked during merger, so the central part of the remnant maintains a relatively low\nspecific entropy of s.2 kB. Material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the NSs forms the bulk of the disk and\nhas entropy of a few kB. In the cases in which black hole formation occurs, the disk entropy is slightly higher (by a couple of\nkB) than in the cases in which a massive NS is still present at the center.\nAlbino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 23\nFig. 13. Visualization of the electron fraction of the merger remnant. Left panel: DD2 M136136 at t = 34.2ms after the merger.\nRight panel: SFHo M135135 at t = 17.2ms after the merger. Both image have the same spatial scale as in Fig. 11 and show the\ndata in a box of size ∼750 km. The electron fraction is used to color the 107g cm−3 (semi-transparent), and the 1011g cm−3\ndensity iso-surfaces. We also show the electron fraction on the ρ = 1013g cm−3 iso-surface for the DD2 M13641364 model.\nThe black surface denotes the approximate location of the black hole horizon, which we identify as α = 0.3, being α the lapse\nfunction. The accretion disks are fairly neutron rich in their bulk, irrespective of the remnant type (massive NS or black hole).\nThe accretion disk coronae are irradiated by neutrinos and are less neutron rich.\n"
"It is indeed a pleasure to journey to this great University, to renew ties with the distinguished scholars of your faculty, and to speak to you on matters of abiding legal and public interest. What I intend to discuss here concerns the two greatest interests of my professional life: the improvement of the administration of justice under professional leadership, notably that of the federal courts; and the aspiration for and ever-growing accomplishment of national unity for our country wherein the participating assistance of the federal courts is a major factor"
"Among the laws that compose California’s primary welfare program is a rule called the Maximum Family Grant (MFG). Enacted in the mid-1990’s, this rule places a cap on the amount of cash aid citizens may receive upon the birth of a new child. Recently, members of the California State Assembly have considered repealing the law on the grounds that it is discriminatory. These claims have been met with criticism, doubt, and confusion. In this essay, I will argue that the Maximum Family Grant rule is indeed discriminatory. Like other welfare and family cap legislation, the MFG rule unjustly redistributes social burdens onto the shoulders of poor households and poor children in particular. Such redistribution has demonstrably negative implications for those children’s health, nutrition, and access to medical care. These facts, I will argue, suffice to ground the claim that the MFG rule and welfare caps like it are instances of institutional discrimination. This essay brings a distinctively philosophical perspective to an ongoing political debate about welfare caps and, I hope, provides some clarity about what precisely is normatively objectionable about the MFG rule and other legislation like it.Entre las leyes que componen el programa de bienestar primario de California se encuentra la llamada regla de la máxima subvención familiar (MFG). Promulgada a mediados de los noventa, esta norma establece un límite en la cantidad de ayuda en efectivo que los ciudadanos pueden recibir por el nacimiento de un nuevo hijo. Recientemente, los miembros de la Asamblea del Estado de California han considerado la derogación de la ley sobre la base de que es discriminatoria.\nEstas afirmaciones han sido objeto de críticas, duda y confusión. En este artículo, argumentaré que la regla de la máxima subvención familiar es de hecho discriminatoria. Al igual que otras legislaciones sobre el bienestar y el límite de ayudas a las familias, la regla del MFG redistribuye injustamente cargas sociales sobre los hombros de los hogares pobres y de los niños pobres en particular. Tal redistribución tiene implicaciones negativas demostrables para la salud de esos niños, la nutrición y el acceso a la atención médica.\nEstos hechos, defenderé, son suficientes para justificar la tesis de que la regla de la MFG y los límites a las ayudas sociales son casos de discriminación institucional. Este artículo aporta una perspectiva netamente filosófica a un debate político en curso sobre las limitaciones a ayudas sociales para el bienestar y, espero, proporciona algo de claridad acerca de lo que es, precisamente objetable en un sentido normativo acerca de la regla sobre el MFG y otras leyes similares"

"The importance of real-time metabolic rate monitoring during extravehicular activities (EVAs) came into question during the Gemini missions, when the energy expenditure required to conduct an EVA over-tasked the crewmember and exceeded the capabilities of vehicle and space suit life support systems. Energy expenditure was closely evaluated through the Apollo lunar surface EVAs, resulting in modifications to space suit design and EVA operations. After the Apollo lunar surface missions were completed, the United States shifted its focus to long duration human space flight, to study the human response to living and working in a microgravity environment.
