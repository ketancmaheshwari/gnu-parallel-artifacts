"Among the laws that compose California’s primary welfare program is a rule called the Maximum Family Grant (MFG). Enacted in the mid-1990’s, this rule places a cap on the amount of cash aid citizens may receive upon the birth of a new child. Recently, members of the California State Assembly have considered repealing the law on the grounds that it is discriminatory. These claims have been met with criticism, doubt, and confusion. In this essay, I will argue that the Maximum Family Grant rule is indeed discriminatory. Like other welfare and family cap legislation, the MFG rule unjustly redistributes social burdens onto the shoulders of poor households and poor children in particular. Such redistribution has demonstrably negative implications for those children’s health, nutrition, and access to medical care. These facts, I will argue, suffice to ground the claim that the MFG rule and welfare caps like it are instances of institutional discrimination. This essay brings a distinctively philosophical perspective to an ongoing political debate about welfare caps and, I hope, provides some clarity about what precisely is normatively objectionable about the MFG rule and other legislation like it.Entre las leyes que componen el programa de bienestar primario de California se encuentra la llamada regla de la máxima subvención familiar (MFG). Promulgada a mediados de los noventa, esta norma establece un límite en la cantidad de ayuda en efectivo que los ciudadanos pueden recibir por el nacimiento de un nuevo hijo. Recientemente, los miembros de la Asamblea del Estado de California han considerado la derogación de la ley sobre la base de que es discriminatoria.Estas afirmaciones han sido objeto de críticas, duda y confusión. En este artículo, argumentaré que la regla de la máxima subvención familiar es de hecho discriminatoria. Al igual que otras legislaciones sobre el bienestar y el límite de ayudas a las familias, la regla del MFG redistribuye injustamente cargas sociales sobre los hombros de los hogares pobres y de los niños pobres en particular. Tal redistribución tiene implicaciones negativas demostrables para la salud de esos niños, la nutrición y el acceso a la atención médica.Estos hechos, defenderé, son suficientes para justificar la tesis de que la regla de la MFG y los límites a las ayudas sociales son casos de discriminación institucional. Este artículo aporta una perspectiva netamente filosófica a un debate político en curso sobre las limitaciones a ayudas sociales para el bienestar y, espero, proporciona algo de claridad acerca de lo que es, precisamente objetable en un sentido normativo acerca de la regla sobre el MFG y otras leyes similares"
"Three applications of Smith's model of magneto-optical effects in stratified magnetic media are presented. Each application involves the incident-angle dependence of magneto-optical effects which Smith's model treats explicitly. In addition. the three applications address current issues in magnetic and magneto-optical recording. The first problem considered is that of nonmagnetic surface layers which form on magnetic recording heads. The second is a theoretical treatment of effects which arise in magneto-optical recording when high numerical-aperture optical systems are combined with media exhibiting interference-enhanced optical properties. The final application is a novel technique for determining the entire dielectric tensor of materials used for magneto-optical recording. The incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect is employed to study nonmagnetic surface layers which form on ferrite recording heads. Calculations based on the Smith model show a correlation between the inert-layer thickness and the incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect. Experimental results confirm the shift in the angular position of the signal peak. in agreement with the theory for finite inert-layer thickness. An unambiguous determination of the inert-layer thickness for ferrite materials is prevented because of a periodic dependence of the peak angle on the inert-layer thickness. Jones-matrix algebra is used with the Smith model to quantitatively determine the effects of obliquely-incident rays on the reflectance and magneto-optical readout signals for various magneto-optical media structures. The most antireflective structure is found to be very sensitive to incident-angle effects. Structures with moderate reflectance (>10%). however. are not significantly affected by incident-angle effects. Finally. a technique for the determination of the optical and magneto-optical constants from multiple incident-angle measurements of reflectance and Kerr rotation is presented. The experimental system employs a Helium-Neon laser and a rotating differential detection system. The technique is used to investigate the optical properties of a series of Cu/Co multilayers and a comparison with a model based on the bulk optical. constants of Cu and Co is made. Anomalous behavior is observed for multilayers with very thin periods"

"Multilayer thermal barrier coatings are candidate materials for high temperature applications that are novel because they employ a strain accommodating interlayer. Plasma sprayed coatings of nanostructured feedstock have shown promise in this direction. Layers of nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia (nano-YSZ) and conventional YSZ were deposited on mullite substrates using the triple torch plasma reactor (TTPR), and on NiCrAlY coated steel substrates using the Praxair SG-100 plasma torch. It has been observed that a wide range of microstructures and porosities can be produced by combining these deposition techniques and varying the feedstock materials. This control over the microstructure enables the achievement of coating properties that can be tailored according to the application and environment.\\ud\\udHeat treatment of the microstructure leads to the formation of larger pores with a significant proportion of partially molten particles. The porosity evolved from the partial sintering of the nano-agglomerates. The microstructure was evaluated using electron microscopy. The nanostructured coatings were compared to conventional YSZ coatings in terms of their microstructural development"

"Standard rate equation models of island formation in the InAs/GaAs(001) system have been reassessed in terms of new experimental evidence from real time in-situ reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) measurements. These measurements have revealed the behaviour and role of the wetting layer in the modified Stranski-Krastanov growth mode during molecular beam epitaxial growth showing that it can continue to significantly increase in thickness following the onset of islanding. The presence of two dimensional (2D) islands, which act as precursors to three dimensional (3D) islands (the quantum dots) in conventional models, does in principle allow an extension of the \"wetting layer\". However, it has been found necessary to extend the standard model to include extra terms that allow material to be incorporated into (and detach from) the wetting layer and which cannot convert to 3D islands. With this improved model, it is found possible to achieve agreement with the RAS measurements"

"This report is intended to assist the Lyndale Neighborhood Association in finding out more about the underreporting of crime within the Latino community and to help to find alternative ways in which the Lyndale Neighborhood Association can assist the Latino community to report crime without fear or trepidation. A total of eighty-five Latino residents in the Lyndale neighborhood were surveyed. Each individual interviewed expressed their perspectives and/or experiences in reporting or not reporting crime and facing crime or criminal activity in their immediate surroundings. Some of the most common criminal activities that Latino residents face on a daily basis are: assaults, car brake-ins and drug dealings, yet the crime reports that appear in the official Minneapolis Police records do not reflect what the participants expressed during the survey. Some of the report recommendations for the Lyndale Neighborhood Association to effectively assist the Latino community in the Lyndale neighborhood to feel safe and secure when reporting criminal activity are: > Establish a safe place or service where Latino residents who fear retaliation or do not trust police can go and be assisted in reporting crimes and violations. > Develop an even stronger relationship with Minneapolis Police Department Precinct No. 5 to address the concerns and/or fears that Latino residents of the Lyndale Neighborhood have in regards to reporting crime. > Organize the Latino community in Lyndale Neighborhood to serve as self-guardians (Neighborhood Watch) of their street blocks with the assistance of the Lyndale Neighborhood Association and Minneapolis Police Department Precinct No. 5.Conducted on behalf of Lyndale Neighborhood Association.

"CLINICAL QUIZDiabetes and nephrotic syndrome: AnswersRodney D Gilbert1 & Edward Hind2 & Bhumita Vadgama3Received: 30 November 2016 /Accepted: 5 December 2016# The Author(s) 2016. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.comKeywords Diabetes . Nephrotic syndrome . Nephroticsyndrome genetic causes .MIDDAnswers to questionsQuestion 1: How are the diabetes and renal disease con-nected to each other, if at all? In principle, when a patienthas multiple signs, symptoms or laboratory abnormalitiesthey can be explained in one of four ways:1) All the problems may be features of a single disease.2) Some of the problems may be complications or sideeffects of treatment given for one or more problemsor diseases.3) One or more problems may be a complication of anoth-er condition.4) The patient may have multiple, unrelated diseases.The first choice in formulating a differential diagnosis isusually to find a single condition to explain everything. In apatient with diabetes and proteinuria, the initial thought isoften diabetic nephropathy. However, diabetic patients aremore likely to have conditions other than diabetic nephrop-athy [1]. This is particularly true in patients with short du-ration of diabetes and good metabolic control. Our patienthas diabetes which is somewhat atypical for type 1 diabeteswith negative auto-antibodies and an unusually longBhoneymoon period^ with very low glycated haemoglobin(HbA1C) levels [2]. The renal biopsy showed focal segmen-tal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and she has other clinicalfeatures, including short stature, poor effort tolerance andabdominal pain. One needs to consider genetic causes ofdiabetes that may account for some or all of these features.The patient had received large doses of analgesics, but therenal disease is unusual for analgesic nephropathy whichtypically presents with papillary necrosis and reduced glo-merular filtration rate (GFR). The association with drugsother than phenacetin remains speculative [3]. Finally, thepatient could have two or more unrelated conditions.Question 2: What further investigations should be under-taken? It would be appropriate to undertake genetic testingfor diabetes and possibly for genetic causes of nephroticsyndrome.Question 3:What is the diagnosis?Genetic testing revealeda mutation in mitochondrial DNA, m.3243A>G, which isthe most common cause of maternally inherited diabetesand deafness (MIDD), a mitochondrial disorder character-ized by maternally transmitted diabetes and sensorineuraldeafness. She was also found to be heterozygous for amissence variant of NPHS1, c.2746G>T; p.(Ala916Ser).The patient therefore has MIDD, and the renal diseasemay be aggravated by the NPHS1 variant.This article refers to the article that can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00467-016-3558-3.* Rodney D GilbertRodney.Gilbert@uhs.nhs.uk1 Southampton Children’s Hospital and University of SouthamptonSchool of Medicine, Tremona Road, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK2 Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Basingstoke,Hampshire, UK3 Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital Southampton,Southampton, UKPediatr NephrolDOI 10.1007/s00467-016-3560-9DiscussionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness was first describedin 1992 [4]. It is caused in the great majority of cases by anadenine to guanine substitution at position 3243 of themitochon-drial DNA (m.3243A>G) encoding the gene for leucine transferRNA. MIDD is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2diabetes, depending on the age of the patient and mode of pre-sentation. About 1% of cases of diabetes are thought to be causedby mutations in mitochondrial DNA, and the m.3243A>G mu-tation accounts for about 85% of these [5].The key clinical features are diabetes and deafness and theirpresence in maternal relatives. As the case of our patient dem-onstrates, these are not always present. The diabetes usuallypresents insidiously, but in 20%of cases it presents acutely, withketoacidosis present in 8% of the latter cases [6]. About 75% ofdiabetic patients with the m.3243A>G mutation have deafness,which is sensorineural and due to cochlear disease [7].Renal disease is common in patients with MIDD, especial-ly females. In one series of 74 patients with MIDD, proteinuriawas greater in these patients than in control diabetic patients, andchronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or greater was four-tosixfold higher despite lower HbA1C, lower blood pressure and a3.7-fold lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy than controls [8].The commonest histological pattern in patients undergoing renalbiopsy is FSGS, but tubulointerstitial disease and renal cysts havealso been described. The combination of nephropathy and deaf-ness may lead to a mistaken diagnosis of Alport syndrome [9].Several other features present in this patient are also ex-plained by the m.3243A>G mutation, including short stature,which is common and caused by a deficiency of growth hor-mone–releasing hormone [10, 11]. Gastro-intestinal complaintsare also common, especially constipation and pseudo-obstruction [5]. The inability to play competitive football islikely to reflect impaired energy utilization and skeletal myop-athy. Cardiomyopathy, retinal macular dystrophy and stroke,features not present in our patient, are also described.Our patient had early onset of several features. This is likelyto reflect high levels of heteroplasmy for the mutant mitochon-drial DNA. The severity and early onset of renal disease mayalso be due to the presence of a heterozygous mutation inNPHS1. This gene codes for nephrin, an important componentof the glomerular slit diaphragm, and homozygous mutationscause Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome.A diagnosis of MIDD has several important implications fortreatment. Metformin should not be used for treating the diabe-tes because of the increased risk of lactic acidosis. Antibioticssuch as tetracyclines and chloramphenicol which interfere withmitochondrial function should also be avoided. Coenzyme Q10has been shown to be beneficial in preventing hearing loss anddelaying progression of diabetes [12]. In patients who progressto end stage renal failure, great caution should be exercised inusing maternal relatives as kidney donors.Learning points& Islet cell and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibod-ies should be tested in diabetic patients with atypical dis-ease behaviour or features. Genetic testing should be con-sidered in patients who test negative for islet cell and GADantibodies. A probability calculator for monogenic diabetesis available at http://www.diabetesgenes.org/content/mody-probability-calculator .& Young diabetic patients with nephropathy and good diabet-ic control are more likely to have disease other than diabeticnephropathy, especially if there is no diabetic retinopathy.& MIDDmay cause renal failure and deafness which may bemisdiagnosed as Alport syndrome.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the CreativeCommons At t r ibut ion 4 .0 In te rna t ional License (h t tp : / /creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use,distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appro-priate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to theCreative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.References1.

"Acrylamide is a process contaminant already regulated in Europe whereas the toxicological effects of certain heat-induced furan derivatives such as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural are still under revision. Acrylamide, HMF and furfural content were evaluated in 113 coated fried foods provided by food services (restaurants and school canteens). Sampling included battered and breaded foods intended for frying and were grouped according to meat-products (ham & cheese, chicken nuggets), fish-products (fish sticks, fish fillets), seafood (squid rings), vegetables (onion rings), and doughs (croquettes). Acrylamide ranged between 23.8 and 130.4 μg/kg, HMF between 0.11 and 16.07 mg/kg, and furfural between 0.01 and 1.04 mg/kg. Presence of these compounds was mostly restricted to the outer part of foods (coating material), since browning reactions are sped up in the crust. Onion rings showed a significantly higher concentration than the other samples being studied. Home-style (freshly made) chicken nuggets exhibited significantly lower acrylamide content than frozen par-fried nuggets from an industrial source. This finding suggests that increasing the complexity of the formulation of the coating through the introduction of ingredients or additives aimed at improving palatability might lead to the development of heat induced process contaminants. As a consequence, the increase of harmful compounds during thermal treatment of coated food should be carefully considered during the industrial formulation of coatings. Although the recent Regulation 2017/2158 for acrylamide does not mention specific values or mitigation strategies for coated foods, its contribution to daily acrylamide exposure within the population must not be dismissed. This study involves the first systematic prospective evaluation of process contaminants in real operative conditions at food services in Spain.This research was partly funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) under the projects SAFEFRYING (AGL2015-46234-R; MINECO) and ACRINTAKE (RTI2018-094402-B-I00, MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE).Peer reviewe"
"A detailed experimental and numerical investigation of the flow features and the self-noise of airfoils near stall and in stall has been achieved. Several airfoils of different shapes have been tested at different speeds and different angles-of-attack. The stall noise is shown to possibly have two different regimes, first a light stall and then a deep stall, with distinct noise features. Both are seen in the low frequency range and are of dipolar nature. Yet, the deep stall has extra narrow peaks which could be associated with shear layer instabilities and large scale vortex shedding. Experiments with a vertical nozzle (large aspect ratio) and a horizontal one (small aspect ratio) have also stressed the strong installation effects on the stall noise features. The two setups yield different low frequency narrow peaks for characteristic Strouhal numbers based either on the chord length or the separation bubble thickness. Possible interaction with the jet have been identified in the vertical setup. In parallel, both RANS and LES results have been obtained on the long-span NACA0012 airfoil in the large aspect ratio setup. The strong interaction with the jet has been confirmed and both the experimental wall pressure coefficient and the characteristic Strouhal numbers have been matched. The spanwise boundary conditions are also found to strongly modify the flow field and to mimic both types of experiments with small and large aspect ratios. Finally an analytical model has been developped for the low frequency range characteristics of the stall noise. It is based on Curle’s analogy for a dipole acoustically compact in the chordwise direction. It is shown to correctly capture the humps seen in the experimental spectrum provided the experimental wall pressure spectra and spanwise coherence lengths are used. Nomenclatur"

X company planned to invest 4.87 billion RMB as property development in this land. In 2015, this project was listed into the twenty most important developing and constructing projects in Qianhai. This thesis chose the X company Smart Port project as the study subject and evaluated its feasibility of investment and development. The thesis investigated the market of similar urban complexes based on detailed data by applying a series of theories and methods such as statistical analysis, financial analysis, risk management, etc., and studied the feasibility. First of all, by combining theories and practices, the introduction depicted in threefold: the overview, the development of Shenzhen real estate market and the investment background research. Next the thesis studied the area characteristics. Then by analyzing relative cases and adding self-characteristics of the project together, the thesis conducts market positioning and design proposal. And then the thesis analyzed the profitability of the project via scoping a series of financial indexes such as costs, income, cash flow, IRR, payback period, etc. Finally, by researching policy risk, market risk and commercial risk, the thesis supposed some suggestion for preventative purpose.  The conclusion of this thesis depicted that X company Smart Port project is located in Qianhai pilot free trade zone，the positioning of the project was well orientated, the design was logical and fresh, attracting market concern, and the potential demand of the market was huge. The developer has sufficient capital to meet the need of investment and construction. The total investment of the project will be4.24billionRMB; total revenue is9.675billionRMB; return on investment 27.5 %. The income was fairly considerable. The project construction will last for 5 years, and with Static payback period of 3 years. The project was sensitive to the change of the price. The project can suffer a certain level of fluctuation on costs and revenues and contains some level of risk resistance capacity. The thesis estimated that the project will bring 13.99billionRMB of tax revenue to the local finance. The project was feasible and has positive social influence.

"ABSTRACT. The relationship between law and moral is the one of the important problems of the philosophy of law. The complexity of the problems needs a comprehensive view that correlated with the concepts of man, society, politics, and ethics. The study of Chinese Philosophy in the Early Han time, with the Chinese philosophy character which tended to correlate with the philosophy of man and political ethics, is expected to give a contribution to the systematic studies of legal philosophy and comparative philosophy.This philosophical research is a library research, which is done in three steps: I: collecting and classifying dataII: data analysisand III: evaluation and final report.The research found that, on the basis of \"basic human goods\" for the sake of \"integral human fulfillment\", the relationship of law and moral are co-existence and interdependence. Both law and moral are qualification each other. The study of the Early Han philosophy justifies that statement. Generally, Early Han philosophy has a naturalistic view in the Yin-Yang cosmological terminology toward law and moral. Except on the Huang-Lao school, the formal philosophy tends to give a lesser status toward law (fa), and take morality (1i) as the ultimate social norms. Nevertheless, the Huai-nan Tau and Huang-Lao school which Taoistic in characters, refuse the cultivation of moral norms (1i), while Tung Chung-shu and Yang Hsiung support the social engineering by means of confucianization of law. The another important phenomenon in the Early Han period is the naturalization of law.Key words: law â moral â Early Han philosophy â fa â .\t, "

Wideacceptance of the germ theory and the sanitaryawakening that followed led to vast improve-ments in animal health and hygiene, and thesafety of dairy products improved substantially.Dairy farmers in northern Europe discoveredthat heating milk fed to their calves furtherreduced the risk for tuberculosis in their herds,and after overcoming concerns that the newthermal pasteurization technology would corruptthe dairy industry, destroy the nutritional valueof milk, and lead to serious public healthproblems, the same level of protection was offeredto human consumers a few decades later (3,4).More recently, thermal pasteurization has beensuggested for eliminating low level contamina-tion of juice by foodborne pathogens (5,6).However, for the safety of solid foods that enterkitchens as raw agricultural commodities,including meat, poultry, and seafood, wecontinue to rely solely on animal health programsand sanitation. Therefore, as we approach the21st century, preventable illness and deathcaused by vegetative bacterial and parasiticfoodborne pathogens remain substantial publichealth problems (7,8).Irradiation pasteurization of solid foods withlow doses of gamma rays, X-rays, and electronswill effectively control vegetative bacterial andparasitic foodborne pathogens (9-11). Publicconcerns, similar to those raised against thermalpasteurization of milk, have been advanced inopposition to irradiation pasteurization, and ithas been claimed that if we but paid moreattention to sanitation and proper cooking, theseproducts could be safely consumed withoutintroducing new technologies.Perhaps. However, the residual risk forinfection that remains after state-of-practicesanitation during production, harvest, process-ing, distribution, and preparation yields anunacceptable level of illness and death. Inaddition, the admonition to properly cook worksonly if culturally acceptable food preferences donot include undercooked and raw foods.Increased interest (encouraged by the publichealth and nutrition community) in freshproduce as part of a high fiber, low fat diet,further reduces the effectiveness of propercooking as a disease control strategy (12).Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness associ-ated with undercooked meat and uncooked freshproduce, and the emergence of the previouslyunrecognized foodborne hazards that spawnedthe conference whose proceedings are reported inthis issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, havestimulated interest in methods of pasteurizingsolid food without altering its raw appearanceand characteristics. Research is under way on avariety of promising approaches, includingpulsed energy, bright light, high pressure, andother nonthermal technologies, but few are readyfor immediate application (13,14; Fed Reg61:42381-83, 1997). Irradiation pasteurization,on the other hand, is a well-established processwith clearly documented safety and efficacy thatcan be put into widespread use as quickly asfacilities can be sited and built (15).Good practice guidelines and Hazard Analy-sis and Critical Control Points programs(HACCP) can result in raw meat, poultry,seafood, and produce with sufficiently low levelsof pathogen contamination that irradiation dosesas low as 1 to 3 kGy yield adequate margins ofsafety for common foodborne pathogens such asCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichiacoli, Listeria, Salmonella, and Toxoplasma (9).No other control for Campylobacter contamina-tion of poultry meat is apparent, and otherapproaches to ground beef safety have proveninadequate to prevent intermittent low levelcontamination with E. coli O157:H7. Likewise, noother solutions are immediately available tocontrol pathogen contamination of produceintended for raw consumption, and irradiationdoses used appear adequate for the bacterial andparasitic pathogens involved in recent outbreaks(Donald Thayer, pers. comm.)The food industry appears reluctant to fullyembrace irradiation pasteurization despite theobvious and painful failure of alternativeapproaches to prevent foodborne infections.Much of this reluctance stems from theperception that consumers reject the process andwill refuse to buy irradiated food. Indeed, surveyshave shown considerable consumer confusionand ignorance about food irradiation (16), and576 Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 3, No. 4, October–December 1997Commentaryreports on public antipathy toward thingsradioactive abound. However, consumer surveysalso demonstrate profound and growing publicconcern about microbial food safety, anddecreasing concerns about the safety of irradi-ated food (17). Knowing as little about it as theyappear to, approximately half of the consumerssurveyed have expressed willingness to tryirradiated food if it will decrease their risk forillness (16). In addition, when educated aboutfood irradiation, 90% of survey participantsexpressed interest in purchasing irradiatedfoods; sampling such food increased interest to99% (18).Irradiation pasteurization is not the cure forall food safety ills. Pasteurization of any sort is nomatch for bad sanitation and substandardpractices, and irradiation pasteurization can beoverwhelmed by large numbers of pathogens.Just as obviously, foods produced and processedunder appropriate conditions that are thenproperly packaged and irradiated are subject topostpasteurization contamination. In addition,the doses of irradiation used to pasteurize freshmeat and poultry are not sufficient to killbacterial spores. Thus, if anaerobic packaging isthe method used to protect irradiated foods frompostpasteurization contamination, Clostridiumbotulinum could pose a risk if the cold chain isdisrupted.Vibrio infections associated with consump-tion of raw molluscan shellfish can be preventedwith irradiation pasteurization, but the Norwalk-like viruses also frequently associated with rawshellfish appear to be more radioresistant thanvegetative bacterial pathogens. Levels of irradia-tion an order of magnitude greater thanpasteurizing doses for meat and poultry also arenecessary to inactivate hepatitis A virus. Toreduce the risk for foodborne hepatitis A andNorwalk virus infections, it will be necessary toreduce the level of exposure of food to humanfeces. This is true regardless of whether or notfoods are to be pasteurized. Although irradiationpasteurization will not eliminate all seafood-borne pathogens, it will reduce the potential ofseafood to cause illness. Seafood HACCP andadvances in viral diagnostics and environmentalvirology will help ensure that prepasteurizationconditions are sufficient to yield seafoodappropriate for irradiation pasteurization (19,20).Just as thermal pasteurization works well forliquid foods like milk and juice, but not for solidfoods for which raw characteristics are desired,irradiation pasteurization works well for meat,poultry, seafood, and soft fruit, but wilts leafyvegetables and sprouts. That irradiation pasteur-ization does not work for every food and everypathogen is poor justification for not applying itfor those food/pathogen combinations for which ithas been shown to work so well.Consumer surveys have demonstrated publicconcerns over worker and environmental safetythat have also contributed to the reluctance ofsome to build and use food irradiation facilities.These concerns are appropriate and addressable.Because food irradiation and irradiation steril-ization of nonfood items like medical supplies areso well established, proper facilities design andoperating characteristics are well known. Therelatively short half-life of Cobalt 60 and itsinsolubility in water reduce environmentalconcerns, which can be eliminated altogether byusing electricity-generated X-rays and electronbeams instead of a radioactive source. Propereducation and training has protected employeesof irradiation sterilization facilities; employees offood irradiation facilities should not be qualita-tively different from other employees in similarindustries.Thus, a broadly applicable solution to manyof our food safety problems exists and has existedfor a number of decades. It is disappointing thatthe public health community has been so silentfor so long on this issue. Faced with the liability ofmarketing hazardous foods, it is puzzling why thefood industry has not stepped into the vacuumcreated by this lack of leadership from publichealth. Presentations at the Conference onEmerging Foodborne Pathogens make it clearthat new foodborne hazards are being stacked ontop of old, unresolved food safety problems—broadly applicable solutions are desperatelyneeded. Just as thermal pasteurization of milkprotected us from E. coli O157:H7 before we knewit was in raw milk, irradiation pasteurization canprotect us from tomorrow’s emerging foodbornepathogen.Michael T.

"Given two versions of a knowledge base (KB), independently modified, we investigated the problem of incorporating changes made to one KB version into the other. We have implemented a system that will perform such a reintegration, autonomously, using predetermined user preferences. This effort has lead to a greater insight into the version reintegration problem and has highlighted those areas where user intervention would be the most beneficial in a semi-autonomous system"

"Abstract. We discuss a model limit problem which arises as a first step in the mathematical justification of our Boussinesq-type approximation [4], which takes into account dissipative heating in natural convection. We treat a simplified highly non linear system depending on a (perturbation) para-meter ε. The main difficulty is that for ε  = 0 the velocity is not solenoidal. First we prove that our system has weak solutions for each fixed ε. More-over, while the chosen perturbation parameter ε tends to zero we show, that we arrive at the usual incompressible case and the standard Boussinesq approximation"

"Upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID, and WFIRST, aim tomeasure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. In order tofully exploit these observations, models are needed that, given a set ofcosmological parameters, can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum atthe level of 1% or better for scales corresponding to comoving wave numbers0.1<k<10 h/Mpc. We have employed the large suite of simulations from the OWLSproject to investigate the effects of various baryonic processes on the matterpower spectrum. In addition, we have examined the distribution of power overdifferent mass components, the back-reaction of the baryons on the CDM, and theevolution of the dominant effects on the matter power spectrum. We find thatsingle baryonic processes are capable of changing the power spectrum by up toseveral tens of per cent. Our simulation that includes AGN feedback, which weconsider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in previousstudies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduceoptical and X-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease inpower relative to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z=0, from 1% atk~0.3 h/Mpc to 10% at k~1 h/Mpc and to 30% at k~10 h/Mpc. This contradicts thenaive view that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominanteffect only for k>70 h/Mpc. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback,cannot be ignored in theoretical power spectra for k>0.3 h/Mpc. It will thus benecessary to improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxyformation, or at least to constrain them through auxiliary observations, beforewe can fulfil the goals of upcoming weak lensing surveys.Comment: 18 pages, 11 figures.

In order to fully exploitthese observations, models are needed that, given a set of cosmological parameters,can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of 1% or better forscales corresponding to comoving wave numbers 0.1 . k . 10 hMpc−1.

This contradicts the naiveview that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominant effect onlyfor k & 70 hMpc−1. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback, cannot beignored in theoretical power spectra for k & 0.3 hMpc−1. It will thus be necessaryto improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy formation, or at leastto constrain them through auxiliary observations, before we can fulfil the goals ofupcoming weak lensing surveys.Key words: Cosmology: theory, large-scale structure of Universe, galaxies: formation,gravitational lensing: weak, surveys1 INTRODUCTIONOne of the aims of cosmology is to find the initial conditionsfor structure formation in the Universe. These can be char-acterised by a single set of cosmological parameters, whichdirectly influence the formation, growth and clustering ofstructure, and hence the distribution of matter as we ob-serve it today.A powerful measure of the statistical distribution ofmatter (and a sufficient one for the case of Gaussian fluctu-ations), is the matter power spectrum, P (k), where k is thecomoving wave number corresponding to a comoving spatialscale λ = 2π/k. Given a sufficiently accurate model for theformation of structure, we can infer the initial, linear power⋆ E-mail: daalen@strw.leidenuniv.nlspectrum from the observed, non-linear one. Moreover, asthe rate of growth of structure depends on the expansionhistory, such a model also allows us to convert observationsof the evolution of the power spectrum into measurements ofother cosmological parameters such as the equation of stateof the dark energy.Some of the most accurate measurements of the mat-ter power spectrum come from studies of weak, gravi-tational lensing (e.g. Massey et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2008;Schrabback et al. 2010), galaxy clustering (e.g. Cole et al.2005; Reid et al. 2010) and the Lyα forest (e.g. Viel et al.2004; McDonald et al. 2006). Up to a few years ago, thestatistical errors were sufficiently large that one coulduse analytical predictions (always assuming, amongst otherthings, that the Universe contains only dark matter), suchas those by Peacock & Dodds (1996), Ma et al. (1999)c© 2011 RAS2 M. P. van Daalen et al.and Smith et al. (2003). The latter used ideas from the“halo model” (e.g. Peacock & Smith 2000; Seljak 2000;Cooray & Sheth 2002) to improve upon the accuracy of sim-pler analytical predictions. In recent years the further im-provement of this model has become increasingly depen-dent on the results from N-body simulations, such as thederived concentration-mass relation for dark matter haloes(e.g. Neto et al. 2007; Duffy et al. 2008; Hilbert et al. 2009).If baryonic effects were negligible, then these methods wouldallow the matter power spectrum to be predicted withan accuracy of ∼ 1% for wave numbers k . 1 hMpc−1(Heitmann et al. 2010). However, we will show here thatbaryonic effects are larger than this on the scales relevantfor many observations.Upcoming weak lensing surveys aim to measure thematter power spectrum on scales of 0.1 hMpc−1 < k <10 hMpc−1. In order to reach the level of precision theirinstruments are capable of, surveys such as LSST,1 EU-CLID,2 and WFIRST3 need to be calibrated using the-oretical models that retain 1% accuracies on these scales(Huterer & Takada 2005; Laureijs 2009).4 This is, however,not as straightforward as increasing the resolution of exist-ing N-body simulations: many authors have demonstratedthat on these scales baryonic matter, which is not ac-counted for in currently employed theoretical models, intro-duces deviations of up to 10% (White 2004; Zhan & Knox2004; Jing et al. 2006; Rudd et al. 2008; Guillet et al. 2010;Casarini et al. 2011).Recent hydrodynamic simulations include many of thephysical processes associated with baryons, such as radiativecooling, star formation and supernova (SN) feedback. How-ever, the processes which cannot be resolved in simulationsare generally also not entirely understood, and different pre-scriptions exist that aim to model the same physics. Becauseof this, different authors may find significantly different re-sults even when including the same baryonic processes. Fur-thermore, it is not a priori clear which physical effects arecapable of changing the matter power spectrum at the 1%level and should therefore be included. These modelling un-certainties may thus prevent upcoming surveys from furtherconstraining the cosmological parameters of our Universe.Here we employ a large suite of state-of-the-art cosmo-logical, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project(Schaye et al. 2010) to systematically study the effects ofvarious baryonic processes on the matter power spectrumover a wide range of scales, k ∼ 0.1 − 500 hMpc−1. Theseprocesses include metal-line cooling, different prescriptionsfor SN feedback, and feedback from active galactic nuclei(AGN). We will see that all of our results are heavily in-fluenced by the inclusion of AGN feedback, which was not1 http://www.lsst.org/lsst2 http://www.euclid-imaging.net/3 http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/4 Since cosmological parameters are inferred from cosmic shearusing a complicated weighting of the power spectrum over a rangeof scales and redshifts, the relation between the accuracy withwhich these parameters can be determined and the uncertaintyin the models depends on the survey and is different for differentparameters. Semboloni et al. (in preparation) will present a moredetailed study of the consequences of our findings for weak lensingsurveys.considered by earlier studies and which has been shown tosolve the overcooling problem that has long plagued hydro-dynamical simulations and to lead to an excellent match toboth the optical and X-ray properties of groups of galax-ies (McCarthy et al. 2010, 2011). Outflows driven by AGNstrongly increase the scale out to which baryons modify thepower spectrum. We also investigate how the power is dis-tributed over different components (i.e. CDM, gas and stars)and examine the back-reaction of the baryons on the darkmatter. In a follow-up paper (Semboloni et al., in prepa-ration), we will quantify the implications for current andproposed weak lensing surveys and we will show how theuncertainty due to baryonic physics can be reduced by mak-ing use of additional observations of groups and clusters.This paper is organised as follows. In §2 we discuss thesimulations and the power spectrum estimator employed.In our main results section, §3, we compare our dark mat-ter only simulation to analytical estimates (§3.1), we com-pare power spectra of simulations with different baryonicprocesses (§3.2), and we investigate how the power is dis-tributed over different physical components (§3.3). In thissection we also examine the back-reaction of galaxy forma-tion on the dark matter (§3.4) and we consider the evolutionof the most dominant effects on the power spectrum (§3.5).We compare to the results found by other authors in §4 andprovide a summary in §5. Finally, we test the convergence ofour results in Appendix A and provide tables of the powerspectra of all simulations in Appendix B.We note that all distances quoted in this paper are co-moving and all power spectra are obtained at redshift zero,unless stated otherwise.2 SIMULATIONSThe OWLS project (Schaye et al. 2010), where OWLS isan acronym for OverWhelmingly Large Simulations, is asuite of large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations.The code used is a heavily extended version of gadget iii, aLagrangian code which was last described in Springel (2005).It uses a TreePM algorithm to efficiently calculate the grav-itational forces (where PM stands for Particle Mesh and the“Tree” describes the structure in which the particles are or-ganised for this calculation, see for example Barnes & Hut1986; Xu 1995; Bagla 2002) and Smoothed Particle Hydro-dynamics (SPH) to follow and evolve the gas particles (seeRosswog 2009 for a review).There are two main sets of simulations, which have pe-riodic boxes of size L = 25 and 100 h−1 comoving Mpc ona side, and are run down to redshifts z = 2 and 0, respec-tively. Most simulations use 5123 collisionless cold dark mat-ter (CDM) particles and an equal number of baryonic (col-lisional gas or collisionless star) particles. We will refer tothe particle number used in a simulation with the parame-ter N = N1/3part (= 512 for the high-resolution simulations).In this work we will focus on z = 0 and hence on the sim-ulations using a 100 h−1Mpc box. The particle masses are4.06×108 h−1M⊙[L/(100 h−1Mpc)]3[N/512]−3 for the darkmatter and 8.66×107 h−1M⊙[L/(100 h−1Mpc)]3[N/512]−3for the baryons. The gravitational forces are softened ona comoving scale of 1/25 of the initial mean interparticlespacing, L/N , but the softening length is limited to a max-c© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 3imum physical scale of 2 h−1 kpc[L/(100 h−1Mpc)] which isreached at z = 2.91. The SPH calculations use 48 neigh-bours.For the initial conditions, a theoretical matter powerspectrum – which of course depends on the chosen setof cosmological parameters – is generated using cmbfast(Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996, version 4.1). Prior to imposingthe linear input spectrum, the particles are set up in aninitially glass-like state, as described in White (1994). Theparticles are then evolved to redshift z = 127 using theZel’Dovich (1970) approximation.On small scales, the physics of galaxy formation is un-resolved, and subgrid models are needed to include baryoniceffects like radiative cooling, star formation and supernovafeedback. Although each OWLS run is a state-of-the-art cos-mological simulation in itself, the real power of the OWLSproject lies in the fact that it is composed of more than50 simulations that all incorporate different sets of physicalprocesses, parameter values, or subgrid recipes. In this waythe effects of turning off or tweaking a single process can bestudied in detail, making it especially well-suited to investi-gate which processes can, by themselves, change the powerat k ∼ 1 − 10 hMpc−1 by > 1%. In this paper we brieflydescribe the subgrid physics included in the reference simu-lation, as well as the differences with respect to simulationswe compare to in §3.2. For a more detailed treatment of thesimulations and the different physics models included, werefer to Schaye et al. (2010).2.1 The reference simulationAs the intention of the OWLS project is to investigate theeffects of altering or adding a single physical process, it isconvenient to have a single simulation that acts as the ba-sis for all other simulations. Such a “default” simulationshould of course include many of the physical processes thatwe know to be important already, as ideally we would onlywant to vary one thing at a time. We call this simulationthe reference simulation, or REF for short. Note that thisis not intended to be the “best” simulation, but simply amodel to build on. In fact, it has for example been shownthat AGN feedback, which was not included in the REFmodel and which we briefly discuss in the next section, isrequired to match observations of groups and clusters ofgalaxies (McCarthy et al. 2010, 2011).We assume cosmological parameter values derived fromthe Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-year results (Spergel et al. 2007): {Ωm, Ωb, ΩΛ, σ8, ns, h}= {0.238, 0.0418, 0.762, 0.74, 0.951, 0.73}. Except for σ8,all of these are consistent with the WMAP 7-year data(Komatsu et al. 2011). This specific parameter describes theroot mean square fluctuation in spheres with a radius of8h−1Mpc linearly extrapolated to z = 0 and effectively nor-malises the matter power spectrum. Measurements in thelast few years have systematically increased the value of σ8,which may influence the validity of our results. To check theeffects of using “wrong” values for this and other cosmo-logical parameters, we have re-run our two most importantsimulations – one with only dark matter and one in whichAGN feedback is added to the reference model – using theWMAP7 cosmology. We briefly discuss these at the end ofsection §2.2. As we shall see in §3.5, this change in cosmologydoes not affect our conclusions.The reference simulation includes both radiative cool-ing and heating, which are modelled using the prescription ofWiersma et al. (2009). Net radiative cooling rates are com-puted on an element-by-element basis in the presence ofthe cosmic microwave background and the Haardt & Madau(2001) model for the UV and X-ray background radiationfrom quasars and galaxies, taking into account the con-tributions of eleven different elements pre-computed usingthe publicly available photo-ionization package CLOUDY,last described by Ferland et al. (1998). The effects ofhydrogen ionization are modelled by switching on theHaardt & Madau (2001) model at z = 9.Cosmological simulations do not yet come close to re-solving the process of star formation, and so a subgridrecipe has to be included for this as well. In our simu-lations, gas particles can be converted into star particlesonce their hydrogen number densities exceed the thresholdfor thermo-gravitational instability (n∗H = 0.1 cm−3; Schaye2004). Cold gas particles with higher densities follow an im-posed equation of state, P ∝ ργeff . Here γeff = 4/3, forwhich Schaye & Dalla Vecchia (2008) showed that both theJeans mass and the ratio of the Jeans length to the SPH ker-nel are independent of the density, thus preventing spuriousfragmentation due to a lack of numerical resolution. Usingtheir pressure-dependent prescription for star formation, theobserved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a surface density scal-ing law for the star formation rate that can be written asΣ˙∗ ∝ Σng (Kennicutt 1998), is reproduced by construction,independent of the imposed equation of state.The reference simulation assumes a Chabrier (2003)stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) with low and high masscut-offs at 0.1 and 100M⊙, respectively. The release ofhydrogen, helium and heavier elements by these stars tothe surrounding gas is tracked as well: gas can be ejectedthrough Type II SNe and stellar winds for massive stars,and Type Ia SNe and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)stars for intermediate mass stars. This implementation ofstellar evolution and chemical enrichment is discussed inWiersma et al. (2009).Finally, the reference simulation includes a prescriptionfor supernova feedback, discussed in Dalla Vecchia & Schaye(2008). Supernovae are capable of depositing a significantamount of energy in the surrounding gas, driving large-scale winds that may eject large amounts of gas, dramat-ically suppressing the formation of stars. In the model usedhere, the energy from SNe is injected into the gas kineti-cally. After a delay time of 30Myr, a new star particle jwill “kick” a neighbouring SPH particle i with a probabil-ity ηmj/∑Nngbi=1 mi in a random direction, giving it an extravelocity vw. The reference simulation uses the values η = 2for the initial wind mass loading and vw = 600 kms−1 forthe initial wind velocity, which corresponds to 40% of theavailable kinetic energy for our IMF.2.2 Other modelsThe OWLS project includes many variations on the refer-ence simulation. We will now briefly discuss the simulationsthat we compare to in §3.2. The different models are listedc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–184 M. P. van Daalen et al.Table 1. The different variations on the reference simulation that are compared in this paper. Unless noted otherwise, all simulationsuse a set of cosmological parameters derived from the WMAP3 results and use identical initial conditions.Simulation DescriptionAGN Includes AGN (in addition to SN feedback)AGN WMAP7 Same as AGN, but with a WMAP7 cosmologyDBLIMFV1618 Top-heavy IMF at high pressure, extra SN energy in wind velocityDMONLY No baryons, cold dark matter onlyDMONLY WMAP7 Same as DMONLY, but with a WMAP7 cosmologyMILL Millennium simulation cosmology (i.e. WMAP1), η = 4 (twice the SN energy of REF )NOSN No SN energy feedbackNOSN NOZCOOL No SN energy feedback and cooling assumes primordial abundancesNOZCOOL Cooling assumes primordial abundancesWDENS Wind mass loading and velocity depend on gas density (SN energy as REF )WML1V848 Wind mass loading η = 1, velocity vw = 848 km s−1 (SN energy as REF )WML4 Wind mass loading η = 4 (twice the SN energy of REF )in Table 1. For more details and other models we again referto Schaye et al. (2010).The simulation DMONLY includes only dark matter,hence the only active physical process is gravity. This modelis useful, as many (semi-)analytical models for the matterpower spectrum assume that baryons are unimportant onlarge scales.The NOSN simulation excludes supernova feedback,and the simulation NOZCOOL assumes primordial abun-dances when computing cooling rates. The simulationNOSN NOZCOOL excludes both SN feedback and metal-line cooling. Naturally, none of the three simulations can beconsidered realistic as we know that the omitted processesexist, but they are valuable tools to investigate on whatscales and in what measure these processes affect the totalmatter power spectrum. In fact, the same may be said forthe other models we consider as all, except for AGN, suf-fer from the overcooling problem and hence apparently missan important process that does occur in nature (be it AGNfeedback or something else).Supernova feedback models suffer from large uncertain-ties due to the limited resolution of the simulations anda lack of observational constraints. Though the product ofthe initial wind mass loading and the initial wind velocitysquared, ηv2w, determines the energy injected into the windsper unit stellar mass and is therefore limited from above bythe energy available from the SNe, the individual parametersare poorly constrained and can thus be varied. One varia-tion on the reference model that uses the same SN energyper unit stellar mass as REF is WML1V848, in which thewind mass loading is reduced by a factor of 2 while the windvelocity is increased by a factor of√2. Another such vari-ation is WDENS, in which the wind parameters scale withthe density of the gas from which the star particle formed:the wind velocity as vw ∝ n1/6H , and the wind mass loadingas η ∝ v−2w ∝ n−1/3H . Both parameters are equal to theirfiducial values for stars formed at the density threshold forstar formation. For the polytropic EoS that we impose ontothe ISM, the wind velocity in this model scales with the lo-cal effective sound speed, as might be the case for thermallydriven winds.We also compare to models where the SN energy is var-ied. One scenario in which the SN energy may be higherthan that in the reference model is when, under certain cir-cumstances, the IMF becomes top-heavy, meaning that rela-tively more high-mass stars are produced. It is expected thatthe IMF is top-heavy at high redshift and low metallicity(e.g. Larson 1998), and both observations and theory sug-gest that it may be top-heavy in extreme environments likethe galactic centre and starburst galaxies (e.g. Baugh et al.2005; Bartko et al. 2010). In the simulation DBLIMFV1618,the latter effect is modelled by a switch from the ChabrierIMF to one that follows φ(m) ∝ m−1 once the gas reachesa certain pressure threshold, which is set so that ∼ 10% ofthe stellar mass forms with a top-heavy IMF. In this case,the emissivity in ionizing photons goes up by a factor 7.3,and it is assumed that the SN energy scales up by the samefactor. In the model we consider here, this extra energy isused to raise the wind velocity by a factor√7.3.The final model that we consider that only differs fromREF in terms of its wind parameters is WML4, in whichthe SN energy per unit stellar mass is doubled by simplyincreasing the wind mass loading by a factor of two. Thesame is done in the simulation MILL. However, the mostimportant feature of the latter is that it uses the same val-ues for the cosmological parameters as the Millennium sim-ulation (Springel et al. 2005). These are derived from first-year WMAP data and are given by: {Ωm,Ωb,ΩΛ, σ8, ns, h}= {0.25, 0.045, 0.75, 0.9, 1.0, 0.73}.The last and, for our purposes, most important physicsvariation we consider here adds a phenomenon that hasproved to be increasingly necessary to reconcile theory andobservations, from the scales of individual galaxies to clus-ters: Active Galactic Nuclei, or AGN. They are caused bythe emission of large amounts of energy from the accret-ing supermassive black holes that reside at the centres ofgalaxies, in the form of radiation that may couple to thegas and relativistic jets caused by the magnetic field of thec© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 5infalling material, which can heat and displace gas out tovery large distances. AGN have been invoked to explain, forexample, the low star formation rates of high-mass galaxiesand the suppression of cooling flows in clusters. Moreover,Levine & Gnedin (2006) have used a toy model to demon-strate that AGN feedback may provide sufficient energy tohave a large effect on the matter power spectrum.We model the growth of supermassive black holes andthe associated feedback processes using the prescription de-tailed in Booth & Schaye (2009), which is an extension ofthat by Springel et al. (2005). During the simulation, a blackhole seed particle with mass mseed = 9 × 104 h−1M⊙ (i.e.10−3mbaryon) is placed at the centre of every dark mat-ter halo whose mass exceeds mhalo,min = 4 × 1010 h−1M⊙(corresponding to 102 dark matter particles). These parti-cles then accumulate mass from the surrounding gas at an(Eddington-limited) rate based on Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttletonaccretion (Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939),but scaled up by a factor α to account for the lack of acold gas phase and the finite numerical resolution. However,for densities below our star formation threshold we do notexpect a cold phase to be present and we therefore set αequal to unity. To ensure a smooth transition, α is made todepend on the density of the gas:α ={1 if nH < n∗H(nHn∗H)βotherwise.(1)Here the density threshold n∗H is the critical value requiredfor the formation of a cold interstellar gas phase (n∗H =0.1 cm−3; see §2.1). Models of this type are called ‘constant-β models’, and the fiducial value β = 2 is used throughoutthis paper.The black holes inject 1.5 per cent of the rest mass en-ergy of the accreted gas into the surrounding matter in theform of heat. This feedback efficiency determines the nor-malisation, but not the slope, of the relations between blackhole mass and galaxy properties. Booth & Schaye (2009)and Booth & Schaye (2011) demonstrate that this efficiencyreproduces the observed relations between BH mass andboth stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion, as well astheir evolution. McCarthy et al. (2010) have shown that theAGN simulation, but not the reference model, provides ex-cellent agreement with both optical and X-ray observablesof groups of galaxies at redshift zero. In particular, it repro-duces the temperature, entropy, and metallicity profiles ofthe gas, the stellar masses, star formation rates, and age dis-tributions of the central galaxies, and the relations betweenX-ray luminosity and both temperature and mass. We there-fore consider simulation AGN to be more realistic than ourother models. As we shall see in §3, the inclusion of AGNfeedback greatly affects the power spectrum on a large rangeof scales.Finally, we have re-run two simulations, DMONLYand AGN, with cosmological parameters derived from theWMAP 7-year results (Komatsu et al. 2011): {Ωm, Ωb, ΩΛ,σ8, ns, h} = {0.272, 0.0455, 0.728, 0.81, 0.967, 0.704}. Theseversions are called DMONLY WMAP7 and AGN WMAP7,respectively. We consider the latter to be our most realis-tic and up-to-date model. Note that the linear input powerspectra used for the initial conditions of these simulationshave not been generated by cmbfast, but by the more up-to-date f90 package camb (Lewis & Challinor 2002, versionJanuary 2010).2.3 Power spectrum calculationThe distribution of matter in the Universe can be describedby a continuous density function, ρ(x), where the vector xspecifies the position relative to some arbitrary origin. Giventhis density field, we consider fluctuations, δ(x), defined as:δ(x) ≡ ρ(x)− ρ¯ρ¯, (2)where ρ¯ is the global mean density. We can relate this densitycontrast to wave modes δˆk via a discrete Fourier transform:δ(x) =∑kδˆk e−ik·x. (3)The density field can thus be seen as made up of waves withcertain amplitudes and phases, with wave vectors k. We nowdefine the power spectrum, P (k), as:P (k) ≡ V〈|δˆk|2〉k, (4)where V is the volume under consideration. The power spec-trum is therefore obtained by collecting the amplitudes-squared of all wave modes with the same wave numberk = |k|, and averaging them. This makes it clear that thepower spectrum is a statistical tool, whose accuracy in-creases when more waves of the same length are available(i.e. when the scale 2π/k is small compared to the size ofthe box). We will present our results using what is oftencalled the dimensionless matter power spectrum, which isdefined as:∆2(k) =k32π2P (k). (5)The dimensionless power spectrum scales with the mass vari-ance, σ2(M), where M = 4π3(2πk)3ρ¯. Note that using ∆2(k)instead of P (k) does not affect the relative differences be-tween power spectra.The code we have chosen to use to obtain accuratepower spectrum estimations from our simulations is the pub-licly available f90 package called powmes (Colombi et al.2009). The advantages of powmes stem from the use of theFourier-Taylor transform, which allows analytical control ofthe biases introduced, and the use of foldings of the particledistribution, which allow the dynamic range to be extendedto arbitrarily high wave numbers while keeping the statisti-cal errors bounded. For a full description of these methodswe refer to Colombi et al. (2009). We have compared theperformance of powmes with respect to power spectrumestimators using simple NGP, CIC and TSC interpolationschemes, and found that powmes is capable of obtainingfar more accurate power spectra over a larger spectral rangewithin the same computation time.We have expanded powmes with the possibility to con-sider only one group of particles at a time, in order to seewhich parts of the power spectrum are dominated by thecontribution of, for example, cold dark matter (see §3.3).Finally, we performed extensive timing tests using differentgrids, foldings, CPUs and particle numbers which, combinedwith the performance results from Colombi et al. (2009), re-sulted in the fiducial values G = 256 and F = 7 for thec© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–186 M. P. van Daalen et al.number of grid points on a side and the number of foldings,respectively.2.3.1 Discreteness and other numerical limitationsIn Appendix A we demonstrate that the simulations are suf-ficiently converged with respect to increases in the numericalresolution to predict the power spectrum with better than1% accuracy for k . 10hMpc−1. This range is greatly ex-panded in both directions if we only consider the relativedifferences in power between simulations.Besides numerical resolution, the predicted power spec-tra may be affected by sample variance, which is generallycalled cosmic variance in cosmology. This is caused by thefinite volume of the box and by the fact that each simulationprovides only a single realisation of the underlying statisti-cal distribution. Note that finite volume effects are differentfor the simulations than for observational surveys, becausethe mean density in the simulation boxes is always equal tothe cosmic mean. In Appendix A we show that finite volumeeffects may cause us to underestimate the effects of baryonson scales of several tens of Mpc, i.e. close to the size of thebox. While the fact that we only use a single realisation ofthe initial conditions prevents us from obtaining highly ac-curate absolute values for the power spectrum on scales closeto the box size, it does not prevent us from investigating therelative changes in power caused by baryon physics.Finally, we are limited in our determination of the powerspectrum by the discreteness of the density field. Because weuse particles to represent a continuous field, there will alwaysbe non-zero power present at all scales, called white noiseor shot noise. If we assume the particle distribution to bea local Poisson realisation of a stationary random field, anassumption used in any calculation of the power spectrumand one that is expected to be valid for an evolved distri-bution,5 this white noise component can be calculated (see,for example, Peebles 1980, 1993; Colombi et al. 2009). Sub-tracting the shot noise from the initial estimate of the powerspectrum will make the latter somewhat more accurate, butone should still expect the uncertainty on the estimate of thepower spectrum to increase dramatically when the intrinsicpower spectrum falls far below the shot noise level. The con-tribution of shot noise to P (k) is independent of k. Hence,if we use ∆2(k) as the measure of the power spectrum, thenthe shot noise level will scale as k3. In the following sec-tion, the scale at which the shot noise of each simulation isequal to (the white noise corrected) ∆2(k) is denoted by acircle, while it is shown explicitly in Appendix A. Note thatthe theoretical shot noise level has been subtracted for allpower spectra shown in this paper.3 RESULTSIn this section we present the power spectra obtained fromour simulations. In §3.1 we compare the power spectrum5 The discreteness noise can initially be much smaller if the par-ticles are arranged on a grid or in a “glass-like” fashion. Particlesin low-density regions may retain memory of their initial distri-bution, reducing the noise below the level expected for a Poissondistribution.Figure 1.

Thebottom panel shows the ratios of the power spectra from theoret-ical models and the simulation. There is good agreement downto scales of a few Mpc, especially for the more recent HALOFITmodel, but on smaller scales DMONLY predicts up to twice asmuch power as HALOFIT. For λ < 102 h−1 kpc the power in theDMONLY simulation drops due to a lack of resolution.of our dark matter only simulation to predictions from theliterature. We investigate the effects of adding or modify-ing prescriptions for baryonic processes in §3.2. We examinehow well CDM, gas, and stars trace each other and con-sider the contributions of these different components to thetotal power in the reference simulation in §3.3, and we ex-amine the back-reaction of baryons on the CDM for the twomost important simulations, REF and AGN, in §3.4. Fi-nally, in §3.5, we take a closer look at model AGN, whichwe consider to be our most realistic simulation because itreproduces the optical and X-ray observations of groups ofgalaxies (McCarthy et al. 2010). We investigate the effectof using the WMAP7 rather than the WMAP3 cosmology,compare to widely used model power spectra, and considerthe evolution of the effect of baryons on the matter powerspectrum.3.1 Comparison of a dark matter only simulationto modelsIn this section we compare the power spectrum of ourDMONLY simulation to those predicted by the widely usedmodels of Peacock & Dodds (1996, hereafter PD96) andSmith et al. (2003, hereafter HALOFIT).The PD96 model is an extension of what is known as theHKLM model (Hamilton et al. 1991), which first introduceda universal analytical formula to map the linear correlationfunction into a non-linear one, the coefficients of which werec© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 7estimated using N-body simulations. Both of these modelsassume spherical collapse of fluctuations that have reacheda certain overdensity, followed by stable clustering (whichstates that the mean physical separation of particles is con-stant on sufficiently small scales). Peacock & Dodds (1994),followed by PD96, expanded on the groundwork laid byHKLM by presenting a version of the method that workedwith power spectra instead and allowed for Ω 6= 1, a non-zerocosmological constant and large negative spectral indices.However, numerical simulations have shown that the as-sumption of stable clustering is not always valid. The morerecent HALOFIT model by Smith et al. (2003) aimed to im-prove on PD96 by taking this into account. This method isbased on concepts from the “halo model”, in which the den-sity field is viewed as a distribution of isolated haloes (e.g.Peacock & Smith 2000; Seljak 2000; Cooray & Sheth 2002).It is then assumed that the power spectrum can be split intotwo parts: a large-scale quasi-linear term that is due to theclustering of separate haloes (the 2-halo term), and a small-scale term caused by the correlation of subhaloes within thesame parent halo (the 1-halo term). Their resulting analyti-cal formulae were fit to power spectra obtained from N-bodysimulations.To create power spectra that conform with these mod-els and the cosmological parameters used in our simulations,we have utilised the publicly available package iCosmo, de-scribed in Refregier et al. (2008). We chose to generate thelinear power spectra using the Eisenstein & Hu (1999, EH)transfer function. We have also tried using the Bardeen et al.(1986, BBKS) transfer function to generate initial conditionsfor the PD96 model, as this is the one originally used by theauthors, which introduced only minor differences with re-spect to the results shown here (1 − 10% lower power fork & 10hMpc−1).In Figure 1 we compare these models to the simula-tion that, like the theoretical models for non-linear growth,includes only dark matter (DMONLY ). For reference, thedashed curve shows the linear input power spectrum of thesimulations. The bottom panel shows the ratio of the ana-lytical predictions to our results. Note that we have omit-ted the first wave mode (at λ = 100 h−1Mpc) in all of ourfigures because we cannot sample the power spectrum onthe scale of the simulation box. We see that the dark mat-ter power spectrum follows the analytical predictions prettywell on large scales (except on the scale of the simulationbox), and that HALOFIT provides a better match than thePD96 model, as expected. However, on scales below a fewMpc the theoretical models start to severely underestimatethe amount of structure formed in the simulation, and thedifference between HALOFIT and the DMONLY simula-tion reaches a factor of 2 on scales of 1− 3× 10−1 h−1Mpc.The rapid decline of the DMONLY power spectrum fork & 100 hMpc−1 (λ < 102 h−1 kpc) is mostly due to theunderproduction of low-mass haloes due to the finite resolu-tion (see Appendix A). While we will always show the powerspectrum up to k ≈ 500 hMpc−1, we are mainly interestedin the scales relevant for upcoming surveys, k . 10hMpc−1.As discussed in Appendix A, for k ≫ 10 hMpc−1 numericalconvergence may become an issue. Note that the power spec-trum of the simulation remains reasonably well-behaved farbelow the theoretical shot noise level (i.e. well to the rightFigure 2. A comparison of the total matter power spectraof DMONLY L100N512 (black), REF L100N512 (green) andAGN L100N512 (red), at redshift z = 0. The bottom panelshows the absolute value of the relative difference of the lattertwo with respect to DMONLY ; solid (dashed) curves indicatethat the power is higher (lower) than for DMONLY. The dotted,horizontal line shows the 1% level. Note that the first wave modehas been omitted as it holds no information. While pressure forcessmooth the baryonic density field on intermediate scales, coolingallows the baryons to increase the total power on small scales.The addition of AGN feedback, which is required to match ob-servations of groups, has an enormous effect, reducing the powerby & 10% for k & 1hMpc−1.of the small circle), indicating that the subtraction of thisnoise component is fairly accurate.Newer implementations of the halo model exist, basedon fits to more recent N-body simulations. These mod-els improve on the HALOFIT model by including a vari-able concentration-mass relation (such as those derived byNeto et al. 2007; Duffy et al. 2008) and have been shown toreproduce the power spectra from simulations with higheraccuracy (e.g. Hilbert et al. 2009). Since no suitable codesemploying these models were available, we do not compareto their results here. However, as Hilbert et al. (2009) haveshown that using the halo model with the concentration-mass relation of Neto et al. (2007) increases the power atintermediate scales, we suspect that such models would pro-vide a better match to the power spectrum of DMONLY.3.2 The relative effects of different baryonicprocessesIn this section we present our main results, demonstratinghow single baryonic processes, or implementations thereof,can influence the matter power spectrum. While we will fo-cus mainly on the range of scales relevant to upcoming weaklensing surveys, 0.1 hMpc−1 < k < 10hMpc−1, we will alsodiscuss the differences at the much smaller scales that oursimulations allow us to probe. We note again that all powerspectra are taken from simulations with L = 100 h−1Mpcc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–188 M. P. van Daalen et al.and N = 512 at redshift zero, and that, unless stated other-wise, all simulations are evolved from the same initial con-ditions.We start by comparing the power spectra of DMONLY,the reference simulation (REF ) and AGN, in Figure 2. Thepanel at the bottom of most plots in this section showsthe absolute value of the relative difference between powerspectra. The dotted, horizontal line shows the 1% level: anydifferences above this level will thus affect the statistics ofsurveys that aim to measure the power spectrum to thisaccuracy.It is immediately clear from the comparison betweenDMONLY and REF that the contribution of the baryonsis significant, decreasing the power by more than 1% fork ≈ 0.8 − 5hMpc−1. This is because gas pressure smoothsthe density field relative to that expected from dark matteralone. On scales smaller than 1 h−1Mpc (k & 6hMpc−1),the power in the reference simulation quickly rises far abovethat of the dark matter only simulation, because radiativecooling enables gas to cluster on smaller scales than the darkmatter. These results confirm the findings of previous stud-ies, at least qualitatively (e.g. Jing et al. 2006; Rudd et al.2008; Guillet et al. 2010; Casarini et al. 2011).However, when AGN feedback is included, the resultschange drastically. In this case, the reduction in power rel-ative to DMONLY already reaches 1% for k ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1(λ ≈ 20 h−1Mpc) and exceeds 10% for 2 . k . 50hMpc−1.We thus see that AGN feedback even suppresses the to-tal matter power spectrum on very large scales. The enor-mous effect of AGN feedback is due to the removal of gasfrom (groups of) galaxies. That large amounts of gas are in-deed being moved to large radii in this simulation has beenshown by, for example, Duffy et al. (2010, e.g. Figures 1 &2) and McCarthy et al. (2011, e.g. Figure 3). Because theAGN reside in massive and thus strongly clustered objects,the power is suppressed out to scales that exceed the scaleon which individual objects move the gas.Figure 3 shows the difference in the power spectra pre-dicted by a variety of simulations relative to that predictedby the reference simulation. The models are listed in Table 1and were described in §2.2. The top panel shows the effectof turning off SN feedback and/or metal-line cooling. SinceSN feedback heats and ejects gas, we expect it to decreasethe small-scale power. Indeed, the power in NOSN is > 1%higher than in the reference simulation for k > 4 hMpc−1and the difference reaches 10% at k ≈ 10hMpc−1. The ab-sence of SN feedback also increases the star formation rate,making stars the dominant contributor to the total matterpower spectrum out to larger scales (not shown).Turning off metal-line cooling reduces the power onsmall scales because less gas is able to cool down and accreteonto galaxies. Indeed, model NOZCOOL predicts 10− 50%less power for k & 30 hMpc−1. However, the absence ofmetal-line cooling increases the power by several percent forλ ∼ 1h−1Mpc because the lower cooling rates force moregas to remain at large distances from the halo centres.Even though the effects of SN feedback and metal-linecooling are somewhat opposite in nature, as the former in-creases the energy of the gas while the latter allows the gas toradiate more of its thermal energy away, removing both pro-cesses in the simulation NOSN NOZCOOL still introducesdifferences of about 1 − 10% for k & 2 hMpc−1 relative toFigure 3. Comparisons of z = 0 power spectra predicted by simu-lations incorporating different physical processes to that predictedby the reference simulation. The panels are similar to the bottompanel of Figure 2, but now show differences relative to REF. Thethin black curve that is repeated in all panels shows the relativedifference with DMONLY. Colours indicate different simulations,while different line styles indicate whether the power is reducedor increased relative to the reference simulation.Top: A simulation without SN feedback (blue), one withoutmetal-line cooling (green) and one that excludes both effects(red). SN feedback decreases the power on all scales. Metal-linecooling decreases the power for λ > 0.4h−1Mpc but increases thepower on smaller scales. The effects of removing both SN feed-back and metal-line cooling are > 10% for k > 20 hMpc−1 and> 1% for k > 2hMpc−1.Middle: Different SN wind models which all use the same amountof SN energy per unit stellar mass (see text). The effects of vary-ing the implementation of SN feedback, while keeping the SNenergy that is injected per unit stellar mass the same, are > 10%for k > 10 hMpc−1 and > 1% for k > 1hMpc−1.Bottom: Models with different feedback energies and processes,see text for details. Including a top-heavy IMF at high pres-sure (DBLIMFV1618 ) or AGN feedback (AGN ) greatly reducesthe power. The reduction caused by the latter is > 10% fork > 2hMpc−1 and > 1% for k > 0.4hMpc−1.c© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 9Figure 4. Difference of the z = 0 matter power spectrum in asimulation using a WMAP1 cosmology (MILL) relative to thatof the REF model, which assumes the WMAP3 cosmology, af-ter rescaling the former to match the latter on the scale of thesimulation box (λ = 100h−1Mpc, not shown). WML4 is shownfor reference as this simulation uses the same baryonic physics asMILL. For k & 3hMpc−1, the effect of AGN feedback is at leastas strong as that of this unrealistically large change in cosmology.the reference simulation. It is therefore vital to take both SNfeedback and metal-line cooling into account if one wants topredict the matter power spectrum with an accuracy betterthan 10%.We compare models that use different prescriptions forSN feedback, but the same amount of SN energy per unitstellar mass as REF, in the middle panel of Figure 3. InWML1V848 the SN energy is distributed over half as muchgas, but the initial wind velocity is a factor√2 higher, re-sulting in more effective SN feedback in all but the low-est mass galaxies. The differences with respect to the ref-erence model extend to even larger scales than when SNfeedback is removed entirely: the power is reduced by > 1%for k & 1hMpc−1 and by & 10% for k & 10hMpc−1. Inmodel WDENS the initial wind velocity increases with thelocal sound speed in the ISM, but the mass loading is ad-justed so as to keep the amount of SN energy per unit stellarmass equal to that in REF. This implementation results inan even stronger decrease in power on scales < 10h−1Mpc.In both these models, the reduction in power is caused bythe increased effectiveness of SN feedback in driving outflowsof gas. We stress that because of our lack of understandingof the effects of SN feedback, there is a priori no reason toassume that the model used in the reference simulation is abetter approximation to reality than the models we compareto here.In fact, it is possible that the SN energy per unit stellarmass is different from the value assumed in the REF model,or that it varies with environment. Model DBLIMFV1618,which we compare with REF in the bottom panel of Fig-ure 3, uses a top-heavy IMF in high-pressure environments.Such an IMF yields more SNe per unit stellar mass whichdecreases the power by > 1% for k > 0.7 hMpc−1 and by> 10% for k > 4hMpc−1. Clearly, it will be necessary tounderstand any environmental dependence of the IMF in or-der to predict the matter power spectrum to 1% accuracyon the scales relevant for upcoming surveys.On the other hand, doubling the wind mass loading,while keeping the wind velocity fixed to the value used inREF, as is done in WML4, has a far more modest effect.This is because the wind velocities are too low to signif-icantly disturb the high-pressure ISM of massive galaxies.The differences with respect to the reference model are lim-ited to . 1% for k . 10 hMpc−1.The bottom panel of Figure 3 also compares the ref-erence simulation to model AGN, which differs from REFby the inclusion of a phenomenon that has been shownto play a role in many contexts and that strongly im-proves the agreement with observations of groups of galaxies(McCarthy et al. 2010). Like SN feedback, AGN feedbackdecreases the power by heating and ejecting gas, but theeffect is more dramatic than that of the standard SN feed-back model, both in scope and magnitude. With respect tothe reference model, the power is decreased by & 30% fork > 10 hMpc−1 and by & 5% for k > 1hMpc−1. The re-duction in power only falls below 1% for k < 0.4 hMpc−1(λ & 10 h−1Mpc). Note that the effect of AGN feedback isstrikingly similar to, albeit stronger than, that of the stellarfeedback model that uses a top-heavy IMF in high-pressureenvironments.It is clear that many different baryonic processes, andeven slightly different implementations thereof, are capableof introducing significant differences in the matter powerspectrum on scales relevant for observational cosmology. Toput the effects of baryons into perspective, we compare toa simulation with a very different cosmology, MILL, in Fig-ure 4. The difference between the cosmology derived fromthe first-year WMAP data used inMILL and the one derivedfrom the 3-year WMAP data used in the other simulationsis large; in fact, the difference is much larger than the er-ror bars of the most recent data allow. For reference, wenote that the currently favoured cosmology (Komatsu et al.2011) lies in between those given by WMAP1 and WMAP3.To account for the difference in normalisation of the MILLpower spectrum, which is caused mainly by its higher Ωmand σ8 values, we have rescaled it to have the same power atthe box size as REF. Still, the effect on the power spectrumexceeds 10% for k & 0.2hMpc−1. A quick comparison withWML4, which uses the exact same baryon physics as MILLand twice the SN wind mass loading used in REF, showsthat the effect of the change in mass loading is relativelysmall, as we had already shown in Figure 3. However, wesee that for k & 3hMpc−1, the effect of AGN feedback is atleast as strong as that of this unrealistically large change incosmology. We thus conclude that baryonic effects are notonly significant at the ∼ 1% level, but can even be largerthan a “very wrong” choice of cosmology.Almost all theoretical models used in the literature con-sider only CDM, assuming that the baryons follow the darkmatter perfectly for k . 1hMpc−1. We have shown (seeFig. 2) that the fact that baryons experience gas pressurereduces the power on large scales, while their ability to radi-ate away their thermal energy increases the power on smallscales. If we ignore AGN feedback, as has been done inall previous work, we find that the power is reduced by atleast a few percent for 0.8 < k < 5 hMpc−1 and that thepower is increased for k > 7hMpc−1, with the differencec© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–1810 M. P. van Daalen et al.Figure 6. The back-reaction of baryons on the CDM. The bluecurves show the relative difference between the power spectrumof the CDM component, after scaling the CDM density by thefactor Ωm/(Ωm − Ωb), and that of a dark matter only simu-lation for either the REF (top panel) or AGN (bottom panel)model. For comparison, the relative differences between the totalmatter power spectra of the baryonic simulations and DMONLYis shown by the black curves. Baryons increase the small-scalepower in the CDM component. However, when AGN feedback isincluded, the power in the CDM component drops 1 − 10% be-low that of the DMONLY simulations for 0.2h−1Mpc . λ .2h−1Mpc.reaching approximately 6% at k = 10 hMpc−1 for the refer-ence model. However, the single process of AGN feedback,which improves the agreement with observations of groups ofgalaxies, reduces the power by & 10% over the whole range1 . k . 10 hMpc−1 and the reduction only drops below 1%for k < 0.3 hMpc−1. Highly efficient SN feedback, as may forexample result from a top-heavy IMF in starbursts, wouldhave nearly as large an effect. One can therefore not expectto constrain the primordial power spectrum more accuratelyuntil such processes are better understood and included intheoretical models.3.3 Contributions of dark matter, gas and starsGenerally, power spectra are calculated using all matter in-side the computational volume. This total matter powerspectrum is what is measurable using e.g. gravitational lens-ing surveys. However, as we have a larger freedom of mea-surement using simulations, we can also consider the powerin different components, for example to see which parts ofthe power spectrum are dominated by baryonic matter orhow baryons change the distribution of cold dark matter.On sufficiently large scales the baryons will trace thedark matter. Hence, when averaged over these scales, thebaryonic and CDM densities are given byρcdm =Ωm − ΩbΩmρtot,ρbar =ΩbΩmρtot. (6)We can now use these expressions to estimate the relativecontributions of correlations between particle types to thetotal matter power spectrum. Using Ptot(k) ∝〈|ρˆtot(k)|2〉 ∝〈|ρˆcdm|2〉+ 〈ρˆcdmρˆ∗bar〉 + 〈ρˆ∗cdmρˆbar〉 + 〈|ρˆbar|2〉, we find, forsufficiently small k:Pcc =(Ωm − Ωb)2Ω2mPtot ≈ 0.68Ptot,Pcb + Pbc =2Ωb(Ωm − Ωb)Ω2mPtot ≈ 0.29Ptot, (7)Pbb =Ω2bΩ2mPtot ≈ 0.03Ptot .Hence, on large scales we expect the power due to the auto-correlation of CDM to dominate the total matter powerspectrum, with a significant contribution from the crossterms Pcb and Pbc.The four panels of Figure 5 show power spectra for theREF L100N512 (left) and AGN L100N512 (right) simula-tion at z = 0, both for the total matter (solid black) andfor individual components (coloured curves). For reference,we also show the power spectrum for DMONLY L100N512(dashed black). The top row shows the power spectra ofδi ≡ (ρi − ρ¯i)/ρ¯i. This definition ensures that the powerspectra of all components i converge on large scales, whichallows us to examine how well different components traceeach other. The bottom row, on the other hand, shows thepower spectra of δ′i ≡ (ρi − ρ¯tot)/ρ¯tot, which allows us toestimate the contributions of different components to thetotal matter power spectrum.Looking at the top-left panel, we see that, as expected,the baryonic components trace the dark matter well atthe largest scales. However, significant differences exist forλ . 10 h−1Mpc. Observe that, at scales of several hundredkpc and smaller, the difference between REF and the darkmatter only simulation is larger than that between the lat-ter and the analytical models we compared to earlier (seeFig. 1). In fact, the difference between the cold dark mattercomponent of the reference simulation and DMONLY is alsolarger than that between the latter and the analytic models.This is due to the back-reaction of the baryons on the darkmatter, which we will discuss in §3.4.Next, we turn to the bottom-left panel of Figure 5 whichshows that cold dark matter dominates the power spectrumon large scales, as expected, although the contribution fromthe CDM-baryon cross power spectrum (not shown) is im-portant as well. The contribution of baryons is significantfor λ . 102 h−1 kpc and dominates below 60 h−1 kpc. Thestrong small-scale baryonic clustering is the direct conse-quence of gas cooling and galaxy formation. Taking a lookat how the baryonic component is itself built up, we seethat gas dominates the baryonic power spectrum on largescales, but that stars take over for λ < 1 h−1Mpc. The gasc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 11Figure 5. Decomposing the z = 0 total power spectra (black) into the contributions from cold dark matter (blue), gas (green) andstars/black holes (red). The left and right columns show results for REF L100N512 and AGN L100N512. In the top row the densitycontrast of each component i is defined relative to its own mean density, i.e. δi ≡ (ρi − ρ¯i)/ρ¯i. This guarantees that all power spectraconverge on large scales, thus enabling a straightforward comparison of their shapes. In the bottom row the density contrast of eachcomponent is defined relative to the total mean density, i.e. δi ≡ (ρi − ρ¯tot)/ρ¯tot, which allows one to compare their contributions to thetotal power. The power spectrum of the gas flattens or even decreases for λ . 1h−1Mpc as a result of pressure smoothing, but its abilityto cool allows it to increase again on galaxy scales (λ . 102 h−1 kpc). The power spectrum of the stellar component, which is a productof the collapse of cooling gas, increases most rapidly towards smaller scales. While stars dominate the total power for λ ≪ 102 h−1 kpcin REF, dark matter dominates on all scales when AGN feedback is included.power spectrum flattens for λ . 1h−1Mpc, which corre-sponds to the virial radii of groups of galaxies, but steepensagain for λ . 0.1 h−1Mpc, i.e. galaxy scales. The reason forthe decrease in slope around 1h−1Mpc is threefold. First,the pressure of the hot gas smooths its distribution on thescales of groups and clusters of galaxies. Second, as the gascollapses it fragments and forms stars. Third, due to stel-lar feedback the gas is distributed out to large distances,reducing the power.The inclusion of AGN feedback greatly impacts thematter power spectrum on a wide range of scales. Compar-ing the top panels of Figure 5, we see that AGN feedbackstrongly decreases the power in the gas and stellar compo-nents relative to that of the dark matter for λ . 1h−1Mpc.A comparison of the bottom panels reveals that the contri-bution of stars to the total power is reduced the most, withthe reduction factor increasing from an order of magnitudeon the largest scales to more than two orders of magnitudeon the smallest scales. This clearly shows that AGN feed-back suppresses star formation, as required to solve the over-cooling problem. For the gas component the change is alsodramatic. While ∆2gas(k) = 1 for λ ∼ 3h−1Mpc in REF,this level of gas power is only reached at 100 h−1 kpc forAGN. The suppression of baryonic structure by AGN feed-back makes dark matter the dominant component of thepower spectrum on all scales shown, although it is importantto note that the dark matter distribution is also significantlyaffected by the AGN, as we shall see next.3.4 The back-reaction of baryons on the darkmatterEven though dark matter is unable to cool through the emis-sion of radiation, its distribution can still be altered by theinclusion of baryons due to changes in the gravitational po-tential. We examine this back-reaction of the baryons onthe dark matter for the reference and AGN simulations inthe left and right panels of Figure 6, respectively. In orderto make a direct comparison, we have rescaled the densityof the dark matter component of the simulations that in-clude baryons by multiplying it by the factor Ωm/(Ωm−Ωb).The blue curve shows the relative differences between thepower spectrum of the rescaled CDM component and thatof DMONLY.c© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–1812 M. P. van Daalen et al.Figure 7. The dependence of the effect of AGN on cosmology.The curves show the relative differences between the z = 0 matterpower spectra for models AGN and DMONLY for our fiducialWMAP3 cosmology (green) and for the WMAP7 cosmology (red).Changing the cosmology has little impact on the relative effect ofthe baryonic processes.On scales k & 2hMpc−1, corresponding to spatialscales λ . 3h−1Mpc, the power in CDM structures in thereference simulation is increased by > 1% with respect toDMONLY. The difference continues to rise towards higher k,reaching 10% around k = 10 hMpc−1. Because the baryonscan cool, they are able to collapse to very high densities, andin the process they steepen the potential wells of virializeddark matter haloes, causing these to contract. The effect islarger closer to the centres of these haloes, i.e. on smallerscales.The back-reaction is quite different when AGN feed-back is included.6 The dark matter haloes still contract onsmall scales, albeit by a smaller amount, but the power inthe dark matter component of the AGN simulation is de-creased for scales > 200 h−1 kpc, corresponding to the sizesof haloes of L∗ galaxies. The reduction in the power of theCDM component in model AGN relative to DMONLY in-creases from roughly 1% at k = 3 hMpc−1 to almost 10%around k = 10 hMpc−1. AGN-driven outflows redistributegas to larger scales, which reduces the baryon fractions inhaloes and results in shallower potential wells. This is con-sistent with the results of Duffy et al. (2010), who used thesame simulation to show that AGN feedback decreases theconcentrations of dark matter haloes of groups and clusters.Note, however, that because AGN can drive gas beyond thevirial radii of their host haloes, their effect on the powerspectrum cannot be fully captured by a simple rescaling ofthe halo concentrations.6 The small difference in power between the CDM componentof AGN and DMONLY near the size of the box is most likelycaused by errors in the power spectrum estimation.Figure 8. Evolution of the relative difference between the matterpower spectra of DMONLY WMAP7 and AGN WMAP7. Fromred to blue, redshift decreases from 3 to zero. The erratic be-haviour of the z = 2 and z = 3 power spectra at the very smallestscales shown is due to a lack of resolution. For λ & 1h−1Mpc thereduction in power due to baryons evolves only weakly for z . 1,but the transition from a decrease to an increase in power keepsmoving to smaller scales.3.5 A closer look at the effects of AGN feedbackIn this section we examine our most realistic model for thebaryonic physics, AGN, more closely.3.5.1 Dependence on cosmologyFigure 7 shows how the relative difference between thez = 0 power spectra of models AGN WMAP7 andDMONLY WMAP7, both of which use the WMAP7 cosmol-ogy, compares to that between the same physical models inthe WMAP3 cosmology (the latter case was already shownin Figure 2). Even though the power spectra are themselvesstrongly influenced by, for example, the much higher value ofσ8 in the WMAP7 cosmology, the relative change in powerdue to baryons is nearly identical, at least so long as AGNfeedback is included. This is good news for observationalcosmology. It means that, once the large current scatter inimplementations of subgrid physics has converged, it may bepossible to separate the baryonic effects from the cosmologi-cal ones when modelling the matter power spectrum. It alsomeans that we can assume that our results of the previoussections, which were based on the WMAP3 version of theAGN simulation, apply also to model AGN WMAP7.3.5.2 EvolutionNext, we use the AGN WMAP7 simulation, which we con-sider to be our most realistic model, to investigate the de-pendence of the effect of baryon physics on redshift. Figure 8shows the relative difference between the power spectra ofDMONLY WMAP7 and AGN WMAP7 at redshifts 3, 2, 1,0.5 and zero. We see from this plot that on large scales,λ & 1h−1Mpc, the reduction in power due to the gas doesnot evolve much for z . 1, although the differences betweenc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 13the different redshifts remain large compared with the preci-sion of upcoming surveys. The weak evolution below z = 2 isconsistent with McCarthy et al. (2011), who found that theexpulsion of gas due to AGN feedback takes place primar-ily at 2 . z . 4. On scales below 1h−1Mpc, on the otherhand, the effects of baryonic processes on the power spec-trum keep increasing with time, with the transition pointbetween a decrease and an increase in power steadily movingtowards smaller scales. This is probably because the ejectionof low-entropy halo gas at high redshift (z & 2) results in anincrease of the entropy, and thus a reduction of the coolingrates, of hot halo gas at low redshift (McCarthy et al. 2011).4 COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS WORKOur predictions for the effect of baryons on the matter powerspectrum agree qualitatively with those of other authors,provided we restrict ourselves to including the same baryonicfeedback processes as were considered in those studies. How-ever, previous simulations did not include AGN feedbackand hence suffered from overcooling.7 As we have demon-strated, AGN feedback (or very efficient stellar feedback)has a dramatic effect on the matter power spectrum over alarge range of scales. In this section we will consider both thequalitative and quantitative differences with respect to pre-vious work, and examine how these may have come about.Jing et al. (2006) used gadget ii (Springel 2005) torun a simulation with a 100 h−1Mpc box and 5123 gasand DM particles. Their simulation included radiative cool-ing and star formation, and used the Springel & Hernquist(2003) sub-grid model for the multiphase ISM and for galac-tic winds driven by star formation. Metal-line cooling andAGN feedback were not considered. They found that thepower at k = 1 hMpc−1 is reduced by ∼ 1% relative toa dark matter only simulation at z = 0, which matchesour results for the reference simulation very well. Further-more, in agreement with our reference model, they find thatthe inclusion of baryons increases the power by ∼ 10% atk = 10hMpc−1. However, they find that the transition froma relative decrease to a relative increase in power occurs atk ≈ 2hMpc−1, while we find that it lies at k ≈ 6hMpc−1.As the simulation of Jing et al. (2006) excludes metal-line cooling, we expect their results to be in better agreementwith our own results for NOZCOOL. The main differencewith respect to the reference simulation turns out to be theposition of the transition point from a relative decrease to arelative increase in power, which shifts to k ≈ 2−3hMpc−1when metal-line cooling is turned off. Hence, using the sim-ulation NOZCOOL, we reproduce both the qualitative andquantitative results of Jing et al. (2006), even though bary-onic processes such as SN feedback are not implemented inthe same way.Rudd et al. (2008) used the art code (Kravtsov 1999)expanded with the Eulerian hydrodynamics solver describedin Kravtsov et al. (2002). They used a 60 h−1Mpc box with7 The toy model of Levine & Gnedin (2006), which we brieflydescribe later in this section, did demonstrate, based purely onenergetic grounds, that AGN feedback has the potential to havea large effect on the matter power spectrum.2563 particles, and included radiative cooling and heat-ing, metal-line cooling, star formation, thermal SN feedback(which is described in Kravtsov et al. 2005) and chemicalenrichment. AGN feedback was not considered. The effectof the baryons on the matter power spectrum they foundis far more dramatic than that found by Jing et al. (2006)and ourselves: a decrease in power of up to ∼ 10% relativeto a dark matter only simulation for k < 1hMpc−1, and arelative increase in power at k & 1hMpc−1 which alreadyreaches ∼ 50% at k ≈ 5hMpc−1. The reason for these largedifferences is unclear.Guillet et al. (2010) used the MareNostrum simulation,which was run using the adaptive mesh refinement coderamses (Teyssier 2002), to investigate the effects of baryonson both the variance and the skewness of the mass distri-bution. They used a 50h−1Mpc box with 10243 dark mat-ter particles and included metal-dependent gas cooling, UVheating, star formation, SN feedback (using the kinetic feed-back prescription of Dubois & Teyssier 2008) and metal en-richment. AGN feedback was not considered. Unfortunately,they were not able to run their simulations down to z = 0,but quote results at redshift 2 instead. In order to bettercompare to their results, we have examined the power spec-tra of REF L100N512 and DMONLY L100N512 at z = 2.In our reference simulation the scale on which baryons sig-nificantly reduce the power increases with time (note thatAGN shows the opposite behaviour, see Fig. 8): in REFthe 1% level is first reached at k ≈ 2 hMpc−1 for z = 2and at k ≈ 0.8 hMpc−1 for z = 0. Meanwhile, the effecton the power on scales k & 10hMpc−1 hardly changes,and the transition scale from a decrease to an increase inpower relative to DMONLY remains fixed at k ≈ 7hMpc−1.Guillet et al. (2010), on the other hand, do not detect a sys-tematic decrease in power due to baryons at any scale. Theyfind that the power is increased by 1% relative to a darkmatter only simulation at k ≈ 3hMpc−1, reaching 40% atk ≈ 10 hMpc−1. For our reference model we instead find a2% decrease for k ≈ 3 hMpc−1 and only a 6% increase atk ≈ 10 hMpc−1. It is hard to say why these results lie so farapart, and especially why the baryons in their simulation donot reduce the power on large scales due to pressure effects.We also compare to the recent study by Casarini et al.(2011), who use the SPH code gasoline (Wadsley et al.2004) to perform their simulations. They use two differentvolumes: a box of 64h−1Mpc on a side, and a much larger256 h−1Mpc box, both with only 2563 dark matter and anequal number of gas particles. Note that the mass resolutionof their L = 64 h−1Mpc run is comparable to that of ourfiducial run, while the resolution of their L = 256 h−1Mpcrun is much poorer. They include radiative cooling, a UVbackground, star formation and SN feedback. For the latterthey use the prescription of Stinson et al. (2006), in whichType II SNe are modelled using an analytical treatmentof blastwaves combined with manually turning off radiativecooling. Metal-line cooling and AGN feedback were not con-sidered. Using their 64 h−1Mpc box, Casarini et al. (2011)find an ∼ 1% decrease in power at k ≈ 1 − 2hMpc−1and an increase in power at smaller scales, which reaches20% at k ≈ 10 hMpc−1. These results are in reasonableagreement with both Jing et al. (2006) and our model NOZ-COOL. However, when using their 256 h−1Mpc box, they –like Guillet et al. (2010) – find no decrease in power duec© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–1814 M. P. van Daalen et al.to baryons at any scale, but instead a steady increase inpower that reaches 1% at k ≈ 1 − 3 hMpc−1 and 40% atk ≈ 10hMpc−1.Finally, we discuss the work by Levine & Gnedin(2006), who used a toy model, rather than a hydrodynamicsimulation, to evaluate the potential effect of AGN feedbackon the matter power spectrum. In their models only the evo-lution of dark matter was followed explicitly. The gas wasassumed to trace the dark matter at all scales and galaxyformation and the associated physical processes were notincluded. Their standard simulation volume is 64 h−1Mpcon a side, and the simulation was run with resolutions of1, 0.5 and 0.25 h−1Mpc. We note that even their highestresolution is more than two orders of magnitude below thespatial resolution in our standard simulations. The gas wasassumed to have a constant temperature of 1.5×104K at allredshifts. A quasar luminosity function was used to deter-mine the number of AGN at a given redshift and luminosity,which were then each placed at a random location, althoughbiased towards high-density regions. Of the AGN’s bolomet-ric luminosity, a fraction ǫk = 1% was used to drive spheri-cally symmetric outflows. Within these outflow regions thebaryon fraction was assumed to be zero. After computingthe power spectrum, they found a large discrepancy betweensimulations with different resolutions: when using a resolu-tion of 1h−1Mpc, they found a reduction of roughly 10%in power for 0.3 . k . 3hMpc−1 at z = 0, relative to asimulation which did not include AGN, while their higher-resolution runs produced instead an increase in power at allscales, of up to 20%. We found a decrease in power of 1% atk ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1, reaching > 10% for 2 . k . 50hMpc−1,which does not agree with their results, even in terms of thesign of the effect. Nevertheless, we do confirm the conclusionof Levine & Gnedin (2006) that AGN feedback can greatlyaffect the matter power spectrum on a wide range of scales.Even though our current understanding of galaxy for-mation still allows for significant deviations between studies,some qualitative results are the same: in the absence of AGNfeedback, baryons will affect the matter power spectrum sig-nificantly on scales k ∼ 1 − 10hMpc−1. Furthermore, allstudies agree that the increase in power due to baryons is ofthe order of 10% at k = 10 hMpc−1. Jing et al. (2006), ourreference and NOZCOOL models, and Casarini et al. (2011)for their high-resolution simulation all predict a relative de-crease in power of ∼ 1% at k ≈ 1hMpc−1. Rudd et al.(2008) also find a decrease in power due to baryons, but intheir case the effect is far stronger than that of any otherstudy, and is seen at much larger scales (k . 1hMpc−1).However, like our reference simulation, all these simu-lations suffer from the well-known overcooling problem. Aswas demonstrated by McCarthy et al. (2010), the AGN sim-ulation does not. We have shown that the inclusion of AGNhas a tremendous effect on the matter power spectrum forλ . 10 h−1Mpc, both when compared to a simulation thatincludes only dark matter and when compared to simula-tions that include baryons and galaxy formation but notAGN feedback. Therefore, contrary to what, for example,Guillet et al. (2010) claim, simulations that suffer from over-cooling cannot be considered extreme models for which theeffects of baryons on the total matter power spectrum aremaximised. Instead, they are prone to underestimate the ef-fects on large scales. Indeed, model AGN predicts a relativedecrease in power of ∼ 1% already at k = 0.4 hMpc−1. Thedecrease in power reaches several tens of percent on scalesk ∼ 1−10 hMpc−1, while simulations that suffer from over-cooling instead predict a strong increase in at least part ofthis range. Based on our results and on the comparison toother studies, we argue that the inclusion of AGN in cosmo-logical simulations is at present even more important thanthe improvement or convergence of existing prescriptions forother baryonic effects.Motivated by the results of Rudd et al. (2008),Zentner et al. (2008) have proposed a method to accountfor the effects of galaxy formation on the matter power spec-trum. This method assumes that the effects of baryons canbe captured by a change in the halo concentration-mass rela-tion. However, it is unlikely that such an approach can trulymodel the effects of baryons on the power spectrum. SinceAGN-driven outflows significantly affect scales much largerthan the sizes of individual haloes, the assumption made byZentner et al. (2008) will certainly not be valid when AGNfeedback is included.5 CONCLUSIONSUpcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID,and WFIRST aim to measure the matter power spectrumwith unprecedented accuracy. In order to fully exploit theseobservations, theoretical models are needed that can pre-dict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of1% or better on scales corresponding to 0.1 h−1Mpc . k .10hMpc−1. Here, we have employed a large suite of simula-tions from the OWLS project, as well as the highly accuratepower spectrum estimator powmes, to investigate the effectsof various baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum.These tools have also enabled us to examine the distributionof power over different mass components, the back-reactionof baryons on the CDM, and the evolution of the dominanteffects on the matter power spectrum.Our most important finding is that the feedback pro-cesses that are required to solve the overcooling problem (i.e.the overproduction of stars), have a dramatic effect on thematter power spectrum. Such efficient feedback, most likelyin the form of outflows driven by AGN, were not presentin the simulations used in previous studies of the effectsof baryons on the matter power spectrum (Jing et al. 2006;Rudd et al. 2008; Guillet et al. 2010; Casarini et al. 2011).Although it was generally assumed that overcooling wouldmake the simulations conservative, in the sense that theywould overestimate the baryonic effects, we demonstratedthat the opposite is true. The efficient outflows that are re-quired to reproduce optical and X-ray observations of groupsof galaxies, redistribute the gas on large scales, thereby re-ducing the total power by & 10% on scales k & 1 hMpc−1.We emphasise that the model from which we draw thisconclusion, the simulation that includes AGN feedback, isnot extreme. On the contrary, we consider it our most re-alistic model. McCarthy et al. (2010, 2011) showed that itprovides excellent agreement with both optical and X-rayobservables of groups of galaxies at redshift zero. In partic-ular, it reproduces the temperature, entropy, and metallicityprofiles of the gas, as well as the stellar masses, star forma-tion rates, and age distributions of the central galaxies, andc© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18Galaxy formation and the matter power spectrum 15the relations between X-ray luminosity and both tempera-ture and mass.We showed that metal-line cooling, star formation, andfeedback from SNe all modify the matter power spectrumby > 1% on the scales relevant for upcoming surveys. Inthe absence of AGN feedback, the simulations with baryonshave ∼ 1% less power relative to a dark matter only simu-lation on scales 0.8 . k . 6hMpc−1 (a consequence of gaspressure) and > 10% more power for k & 10 hMpc−1 (a con-sequence of gas cooling). However, as we noted above, AGNfeedback can decrease the power for 1 . k . 10 hMpc−1by up to several tens of percent. Furthermore, some imple-mentations of stellar feedback, e.g. the strong SN feedbackresulting from a top-heavy stellar initial mass function instarbursts, can create differences of the same scope and mag-nitude by redistributing gas out to very large scales. Theeffects from such baryonic processes on the matter powerspectrum can even exceed those of a very large change incosmology (e.g. WMAP3 to WMAP1). Indeed, differences> 1% persist even up to scales as large as those correspond-ing to k ≈ 0.3 hMpc−1.In the absence of AGN feedback, the back-reaction ofbaryons on the dark matter increases the power in the CDMcomponent by 1% at k ≈ 2hMpc−1 and the effect becomeslarger towards smaller scales. However, when AGN are in-cluded they redistribute sufficiently large quantities of gasout to large radii to lower the power in the dark matter com-ponent by 1 − 10% for 3 . k . 30hMpc−1. This is consis-tent with Duffy et al. (2010), who used the same simulationto show that AGN feedback decreases the concentrations ofdark matter haloes of groups of galaxies. We stress, how-ever, that the back-reaction of AGN feedback on the CDMwill not be straightforward to implement in dark matter onlymodels. While it may be possible to roughly model the effectof baryons in simulations without efficient feedback by rais-ing the concentration parameters of the dark matter haloes(e.g. Zentner et al. 2008), feedback from AGN redistributesthe gas on scales that exceed those of their host haloes.The difference between dark matter only simulationsand simulations that do include baryons is nearly the samefor the WMAP3 and WMAP7 cosmologies, at least whenAGN are included. This suggests that the relative effect ofthe baryons is roughly independent of cosmology, which willsimplify future studies aiming to disentangle the two.For our most realistic simulation, which assumes theWMAP7 cosmology and includes AGN feedback, the differ-ence in power relative to the corresponding dark matter onlysimulation does not evolve much for z . 1 on large scales(k < 10 hMpc−1). This is consistent with McCarthy et al.(2011), who showed that the expulsion of gas through AGNfeedback occurs mostly at z ∼ 2 − 4, in the progenitors oftoday’s groups and clusters of galaxies.We demonstrated that our conclusions are robust withrespect to changes in the size of the simulation box andchanges in the resolution (see Appendix A), with any addi-tional modelling uncertainties only making it less likely thatthe matter power spectrum can be predicted with 1% accu-racy any time soon. Looking at the large differences that stillexist between the results of different authors, it is clear thatmuch work remains to be done in understanding processessuch as gas cooling and outflows.In a forthcoming paper (Semboloni et al., in prepa-ration), we will study the implications of our findings forweak lensing surveys in more detail. In this work we willalso demonstrate that the use of optical and X-ray observa-tions of groups of galaxies can significantly reduce the un-certainties in the predictions of the matter power spectrum.While this provides a strong incentive for obtaining betterand more observations of groups of galaxies, it is importantto note that such auxiliary data will never completely re-move the uncertainty inherent to cosmological probes of thematter distribution on scales that are potentially affectedby baryonic physics. This is because one can never be surethat all the relevant effects are constrained by the secondaryobservations. For example, it may be that other models forthe baryonic physics exist that also reproduce optical andX-ray observations of groups, but nevertheless predict dif-ferent power spectra. It will therefore be crucial to considera wide variety of observations, with optical and X-ray aswell as Sunyaev-Zel’dovich observations holding particularpromise, and a large range of models.While the strong baryonic effects that we find implythat the cosmological constraints provided by upcomingweak lensing surveys will be model-dependent, it also meansthat such surveys will provide constraints on the physics ofgalaxy formation on scales that are difficult to obtain byother means.Tabulated values of power spectra for redshifts z = 0−6 are available for all the simulations shown in this paperas Supporting Information with the online version of thisarticle, and at http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/VD11/ (seeAppendix B).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank all members of the OWLS team for their contribu-tions to the project.

The difference between the power spectrum of the100 and the 50 h−1Mpc box is smaller than the differencebetween the latter and the 25 h−1Mpc box for all k, andthe power spectrum of the largest box is nearly convergedfor k & 20 hMpc−1.However, there are differences of up to a factor of a fewat larger scales. For reference, we also show the input powerspectrum linearly evolved to z = 0 and the HALOFIT modelof the non-linear power spectrum by Smith et al. (2003) (see§3.1). The first wave mode corresponds to the size of the sim-ulation box, which means that the power measured on thisscale is meaningless; hence, we have omitted this point inall of our figures. The second and third wave modes closelyfollow the linear power spectrum. Note that the curves havevery similar shapes on large scales, with the larger boxesshifted to larger scales. This is a consequence of employingthe same seed for the random number generator used to cre-ate the initial conditions. Perturbations that should go non-linear (λ . 10 h−1Mpc) are unable to collapse if their wave-length is close to the size of the box, which in turn suppressesthe power on smaller scales. One might therefore worry thateven the 100 h−1Mpc box is not large enough to obtain ac-curate power spectra for k & 1hMpc−1. Lacking larger sim-ulations to check this, we compare to the HALOFIT modelfor the non-linear power spectrum, which shows where thetransition from the linear power spectrum should take placeat redshift zero. The power spectrum for the 100 h−1Mpcbox follows this model very well on large scales, suggestingthat a simulation of this size is very close to converged.Note that finite volume effects only prevent us from ob-taining highly accurate absolute power spectra, and only forthe largest scales, while our results are based on the rela-tive comparisons between models that used identical initialconditions. Since the 100 h−1Mpc box extends up to thelargest non-linear scales, and since all simulations start fromthe exact same realisation of the linear power spectrum atz = 127, we do not expect our results to be affected by thefinite volume of the simulations.A2 Numerical resolutionIn Figure A2 we investigate the effects of changing the reso-lution for the reference simulation by varying the number ofparticles while keeping the box size fixed. The power spec-trum of REF L100N128 is quite noisy for k & 100 hMpc−1because of its much higher Poisson noise level. Testingfor convergence on these scales is only possible thanksto the accurate shot noise subtraction. Surprisingly, therelative difference in power between REF L100N128 andREF L100N512 is smaller than the difference between thelatter and REF L100N256. When increasing the resolutionbeyond that of REF L100N256, the power begins to de-crease. To examine if this trend continues, we compare theFigure A1. Test of convergence of the z = 0 matter power spec-trum in the reference model with respect to the size of the simu-lated volume, where the box size and particle number are variedin such a way as to keep the resolution constant. Also shown arethe linear input power spectrum and the analytical non-linearpower spectrum by Smith et al. (2003). The red, dotted line inthe top panel shows the (subtracted) theoretical shot noise level.The bottom panel shows the ratio of REF L100N512 with respectto the other simulations.power spectrum of REF L050N256, which has the same res-olution as REF L100N512, to that of REF L050N512 in thepanel on the right. We see that the power on the smallestscales (k & 10hMpc−1) converges only slowly, but that thetrend of decreasing power with increasing resolution contin-ues. This may indicate that, as lower mass haloes becomeresolved, the overall effects of supernova feedback becomestronger.We can verify this by isolating the effects due to baryonphysics from those due to a more straightforward depen-dence on resolution. To this end, we examine what the effectis of increasing the particle number of the DMONLY simu-lation with a 100 h−1Mpc box in Figure A3. The behaviourhere is quite different: as N grows, more low-mass haloesare resolved and the power on small scales increases. As weobserve a reversed trend in Figure A2, we conclude that theincreased baryonic effects that accompany a higher particlenumber are more important for the power spectrum thanthe straightforward dependence on resolution.The difference between REF L050N256 andREF L050N512 is ∼ 0.1% at k = 1hMpc−1 and∼ 2% at k = 10 hMpc−1. We conclude that simulationREF L100N512 is sufficiently converged for the scales ofinterest for this study, k . 10 hMpc−1. Note that, sincewe are only interested in the relative differences betweensimulations with equal resolution, the uncertainty will inpractice be much smaller. With increased resolution we ex-pect feedback processes to become more effective, meaningthat we may have underpredicted the differences betweenmodels with different feedback processes in low-mass haloeson small scales.Similar tests were performed by Colombi et al. (2009)c© 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–1818 M. P. van Daalen et al.Figure A2. As in Figure A1, but now the numerical resolution is varied while keeping the box size constant.

Same as the left-hand panel of Figure A2, but now forDMONLY instead of REF. Here the behaviour is as expected: asthe number of particles goes up, more low-mass haloes form andthe power on small scales increases. A comparison with Figure A2shows that increasing the resolution leads to stronger baryoniceffects which may reverse the sign of the trend with resolution.for the convergence of powmes, which keeps the statisticalerror bounded through its use of foldings. Its value dependson the quantity C(k), which is defined as the number ofindependent wave modes at a given wave number k; to bemore precise, we approximately have ∆P/P ∝ C(k)−1/2(Colombi et al. 2009). For our fiducial grid with 2563 gridcells, one can expect the statistical error to remain below|∆P |/P ≈ 1.2% as long as errors due to shot noise do notdominate. We have checked that this is indeed the case. Notethat this means that we can confidently measure 1% differ-ences between simulations using our fiducial values, as weTable B1.

A prototype of a new concept of thermo-accumulation solid fuel-fired furnace has been developed to meet these growing needs, providing electricity saving together with considerable environmental benefits. Two strategies for reduction of carbon monoxide emission are examined in the paper: application of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, in the form of 3 ± 0.3 mm spheres, providing further combustion of flue gases within the furnace, as well as an additional emission reduction by means of the air excess control. Experimental investigations of the catalyst influence on the conversion of carbon monoxide have been done for different operation regimes and positions of the catalyst. The paper presents selected results regarding carbon monoxide emission during wood and coal combustion. Investigations suggest a considerable effect of the catalyst and a strong influence of the catalyst position within the furnace to carbon monoxide emission reduction. In addition, experimental tests have been conducted to asses the effect of the air excess control in the furnace on carbon monoxide emission. The amount of combustion air, the flue gas flow rate, and the fuel feeding regime have been adjusted in order to keep the flue gas oxygen content in a relatively narrow range, thus obtaining controlled combustion conditions and lower carbon monoxide emission. In this way, the furnace has been made able to respond to the changes in heating needs, fuel quality and other parameters, which is advantageous in comparison with similar solid-fuel fired furnaces.

"L'auteur décrit d'abord une série d'équivoques « secondaires » du régime légal de règlement des conflits d'intérêts dans la province de Québec hors les services publics. Il rattache ces ambiguïtés actuelles ou virtuelles à une équivoque « fondamentale », qui est l'écartèlement entre la liberté qui doit servir de base à une société démocratique et la peur qui suscite les lois restrictives. Pour éliminer la crainte et pour redonner à la démocratie industrielle toute sa vitalité, l'auteur s'efforce de situer le conflit social (surtout industriel) dans sa véritable perspective, en décrivant sa diversité et ses conséquences utiles fort nombreuses.We shall be dealing here with the legal arrangements for the prevention or the settlement of union-management disputes over matters of interests, thus excluding conflicts over rights. The Quebec conciliation system shall be used as a case in point, since it is typical of most labour legislations in Canada and other \"free entreprise\" countries. Conflicts in public utilities shall not be dealt with, nor shall we analyse the whole picture of union-management relations, since our study is strictly juridical and theoretical in nature.Our aim is to improve labour legislation in the area of disputes settlement by pointing to a number of ambiguities and confusions in the law which should be corrected. Any body of social legislation which is not constantly improved on the basis of its obvious consequences is a dead body and a dangerous nuisance. It should be noted, however, that the most technically correct piece of legislation will yield poor results in a hypothetical climate of political tensions, antagonisms and distrust, while a less perfect body of laws will foster peace and harmony where there exist freedom, confidence and co-operation.SOME SECONDARY CONFUSIONS1. \"Arbitration\". Our \"councils of arbitration\" arbitrate nothing, inasmuch as the final award is solely a set of recommendations which have no binding power (and more often than not very little moral authority) on the parties. They constitute only the second step of the conciliation procedure.2. It might be very useful for our legislation to distinguish clearly between \"conflicts of interests\" and \"conflicts over rights\", in order to determine the proper jurisdictions (conciliator or arbitrator) and effects (binding or not) of the award, if any. Although most collective labour agreements do draw the line by stipulating compulsory arbitration of grievances, some ambiguities still remain. The main one is the tendency to assimilate \"grievances\" with \"conflicts over rights\", and to limit conflicts of interests to the pre-contract phase, while it should be obvious that many disputes arising while an agreement is in force cannot be dealt with on the basis of clear predetermined rights. Since the agreement cannot foresee and provide for every situation, conflicts of interests are bound to arise after it has been signed, and deserve the same careful discussion and honest consideration as conflicts arising at the negotiation phase prior to the signature of the agreement.3. The meaning and scope of the word \"dispute\" must be looked for, not in the Quebec Trades Disputes Act, but in the Labour Relations Act. And care must be taken not to unduly restrict the field of so-called \"conditions of employment\" nor to limit the scope of the agreements which the parties are allowed to reach, with a view to reducing the possibilities of conflict.4. \"Equity and good conscience\" are resorted to only when the law is silent or ambiguous. They are mere natural justice and common sense. And since objective economic criteria are lacking, on the whole, for the \"council of arbitration\" to make a scientifically-based award, it should be kept in mind that \"equity and good conscience\" will permit only an approximation of justice.5. Being the first step in a compulsory procedure, the conciliation officer does not have an easy job, especially when the parties are powerhouses in strategic bargaining centers and are expected to create patterns which will be followed by an industry or a region. True, he intervenes only when direct negotiations break, and at the request of one of the parties; but as an essential part of a rigid procedure, he is often seen as a hurdle to be cleared as quickly as possible, rather than as a competent friend eager and able to help. He can be imposed by either party upon the other whenever negotiations (whether seriously carried out or not) run into a deadlock. It is this very imposition that irritates some of the parties and leads them to retaliate by treating the conciliator lightly, particularly so in the hypothesis of a tense political environment. The conciliation officer will usually be more welcome in sectors where collective bargaining is new or relatively weak, or where one party is much weaker than the other. In all cases, however, the conciliator may be relatively useful he realizes that he is above all the servant of the parties themselves, and never the distributor of rules of conduct and \"solutions\" to the parties.6. The president of the \"council of arbitration\" will do a helpful job (again despite the compulsory character of the procedure) in some cases if he understands clearly that his first duty is to serve the parties, and not the minister of Labour who appoints him. He is primarily a man of conciliation, not a man of awards. He will realize this more easily if he ponders over the scarcity of sound and safe economic criteria by which he can reach not too haphazard decisions in a most complex field, economic activity. For conflicts of interests are born out of the antagonism of two freedoms which, left undefined by law, may pretend to total discretion. Such being the case, the president will never attempt to pass judgment as a magistrate would do in a court of law, but will on the contrary always be looking for the very mobile point of mutual acceptability at which the parties may agree.7. The representatives of the parties on the \"council of arbitration\" are exactly that; they should not be expected to be impartial, since their appointment is suggested by the respective parties and since they are in most cases remunerated by them. They may be assimilated to assessors trying to enlighten the president on the merits of a given viewpoint (their own) and to get the best possible deal for their party. To see them as \"arbitrators\" would be extremely misleading.8. The award of the \"council of arbitration\" is usually at best a good guess, having little claim to scientific accuracy. It is a set of recommendations, and not a judgment, since in the first place it is not binding for the parties which constitute our object of study here. Therefore, it deserves little publicity, and should never be intended to be used as precedent. It is strictly the property of the parties themselves, and should not, as a rule, be used as an instrument of public control. If made public prematurely, it may have most injurious effects on subsequent, post-arbitral negotiations, on the precarious equilibrium of the parties, on the relative flexibility of their positions, by creating false hopes on not too certain grounds and by possibly displacing artificially and arbitrarily the point of mutual acceptability and thus delaying the settlement of the dispute.THE MAIN CONFUSIONAll the above confusions may be traced to one fundamental ambiguity, one big opposition between two prime movers: liberty, on the one side, and fear, on the other. In a democratic society, the freedoms of association, professional activity, expression, enterprise and contract, among others, are held as sacred and seen as the very foundations of democracy itself. And yet, in the face of oppositions of interests (just another definition for conflicts), we are tempted to quickly throw overboard all principles, allowing ourselves instead to be governed by sheer physical fear of potential outbursts of violence. Without realizing that aggressive forms of conflict are the exception in Canada and in Quebec particularly, and possibly led by fear-mongers with an axe to grind, we are inclined to favour restrictive measures (in legislation and administration) destined to prevent conflict at all costs. Needless to say, conciliation legislation based on freedom will be diametrically opposed to another based on fear. In the first instance, the parties will be allowed to bargain on all matters which do not go against public order and safety; the preventive procedure will be optional and will provide alternatives; if for a while the procedure remains compulsory, its steps will be as few and as short as possible; and the conciliation services provided by the government will be aimed not only at prevention, but mainly at education of the parties in the intricacies of collective bargaining. In the perspective of fear, conciliation legislation shall be exactly the opposite. To prevent open conflict, the law will provide a number of time-consuming steps, with the hope that the parties will gradually \"cool off\".Unfortunately, the \"cooling-off period\" more often than not turns into a \"warming-up period\", and the procedure defeats its avowed purpose by creating or at least magnifying the object of its fear. The parties, frustrated and irritated by long delays, and compelled to stimulate their respective militancy during the protracted debates under \"public scrutiny\", are often led to uncompromising stands where flexibility could have been possible otherwise, thus multiplying the possibilities of aggressive conflict.THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CONFLICTThe fear just described has its main root in a false notion of the meaning, variety and functions of conflict, social and particularly industrial. Conflict is essentially an opposition, manifested in a good number of ways, \"diplomatic\", \"aggressive\" and possibly violent. \"Conflict and co-operation are not separable things, but phases of one process which always involves something of both\". \"Social conflict. mean[s] a struggle over values and claims to scarce Status, power and resources in which the aims of the opponents are to neutralize, injure or eliminate their rivals\". Furthermore, conflict is everywhere, and seems only partly avoidable: we have it in primary groups (family, groups of friends, neighborhood), within and between cities, associations and countries; once institutionalized, however, conflict becomes an essential element of the social structure.Industrial conflict, for instance, can be expressed in a number of ways, such as: systematic restriction of output, sabotage, excessive turnover, absenteeism or lateness, boycott, grievances, accident-proneness, waste, pilfering, unduly strict abidance by the letter of the agreement or deliberate dents into its provisions, and more aggressive and concerted forms like the strike. We exclude the lockout, which has ceased to be a tactically useful and socially acceptable mode of industrial warfare.Social conflict, despite the harm which may accompany it in some instances, has many positive functions. It is an essential element of sociation, together with co-operation. It is responsible for most of the dynamism of a social structure. It helps a group or a society rid itself of violently disagreeable features which weaken it. It provides a safety-valve for the reduction of conflict of a more violent and persistent nature; by bringing oppositions into the open, it permits their quick solution under the eye of public opinion. It increases the cohesiveness and individuality of the contestant groups. It provokes associations and coalitions which are so many forms of sociation; in a perspective of synthesis, of global social relationship, opposition ( even violent ) between individuals, groups or societies may be signally positive in its consequences.Now with regard to industrial conflict, the strike, for instance, does perform a useful function. It is, either as a fact or as a possibility, part and parcel of the collective bargaining process. \"In the last fifteen minutes of big controversies, it is the right to strike, the possibility of a strike, that is the instrument with which the controversy is settled. It is always present at the conference table. Without it, you do not have collective bargaining\". Moreover, the strike helps reduce social tensions by airing grievances, suggesting improvements and establishing a new \"order\" on more acceptable grounds.And finally, the strike is a symbol of freedom and independence. The fact that it occurs or can happen is a clear indication of the vitality of a society and of the liberty therein.CONCLUSIONThe above notions may suggest a new outlook on social and industrial conflict which would eliminate fear, restore freedom in practice and provide us with a more rational labour legislation in the specific field of disputes settlement"

"Current GABAergic sleep-promoting medications were developed pragmatically, without making use of the immense diversity of GABAA receptors. Pharmacogenetic experiments are leading to an understanding of the circuit mechanisms in the hypothalamus by which zolpidem and similar compounds induce sleep at α2βγ2-type GABAA receptors. Drugs acting at more selective receptor types, for example, at receptors containing the α2 and/or α3 subunits expressed in hypothalamic and brain stem areas, could in principle be useful as hypnotics/anxiolytics. A highly promising sleep-promoting drug, gaboxadol, which activates αβδ-type receptors failed in clinical trials. Thus, for the time being, drugs such as zolpidem, which work as positive allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors, continue to be some of the most effective compounds to treat primary insomnia"

"This study investigates the relationship between book-tax differences (BTDs) and earnings management, tax management, and their interactions in Chinese-listed companies. Using unique tax-effect BTDs obtained from Chinese B-share-listed firms, we find that firms with strong incentives for earnings and tax management exhibit high levels of abnormal BTDs. This suggests that BTDs can be used to capture both accounting and tax manipulations induced by managerial motivations. Our results indicate that earnings management explains 7.4% of abnormal BTDs, tax management accounts for 27.8% of abnormal BTDs, and their interaction explains 3.2% of abnormal BTDs. Tax-effect BTDs are more powerful than income-effect BTDs in capturing opportunistic reporting at both conceptual and empirical levels"

INTRODUCTIONQuantum Computation (QC) [1] poses extreme chal-lenges for coherent control of large-scale quantum sys-tems. Coping with decoherence and imperfect controlimplies the use the of error correction codes (QEC)and fault tolerant operation. However, maximizing thethreshold for arbitrary computation requires the abilityto perform multiple, simultaneous operations betweenqubits and minimal communication and transport over-heads. Incorporating these features in a scalable man-ner is a major goal for all potential system implementa-tions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].A promising candidate for quantum information pro-cessing is the ion trap with superb coherence and fewqubit control having been already demonstrated [7, 8].However, it is difficult to effectively control more than afew tens of ions in a single trap, hence several ideas havebeen proposed to overcome this limitation. Multiple mi-crotraps can be constructed in the same structure withions shuttled between them (CCD architecture) [2]. Themain disadvantage of a CCD trap is the difficulty in de-signing a micro-trap structure that allows for maximumparallelizability for both inter- and intra-logical opera-tions. Shuttling heats ions up, requiring additional cool-ing in the interaction regions and slowing operation. Ad-ditionally, large numbers of electrodes and lasers wouldbe required in a single device [9].Alternatively, ions in separate trap structures may bemade to interact via a photonic bus [10, 11, 12, 13, 14,15, 16]. If used directly to implement two-qubit gates,photon loss from the bus is a major problem and re-quires additional QEC overhead [17, 18]. Alternatively,the photonic bus can mediate the generation of entangle-ment between traps which can then be used to performgates [19] [50].The use of entanglement for intra-computer communi-cation is not a new idea. For example, this has been∗Electronic address: D.K.L.Oi@damtp.cam.ac.ukOpticalInterfaceIonAncillaIonsDataIonsOpticalLinkto Other TrapsRF ElectrodesSegmented ElectrodesControl LasersFIG. 1: An ion trap node. A single ion trap contains enoughions for a single encoded qubit, ancillas and an interface ion.Conventional single and two-qubit operations are performedvia axial phonon modes of the trap. The interface ion may beentangled with its counterpart in another identical trap viaphoton interference and path erasure. The resultant Bell linkis used to perform inter-trap operations. The simplest nodeconsists of a single optically coupled ion, five ions encodinga single logical qubit, and several ancilla for fault tolerantoperations and singlet purification.proposed in CCD ion trap designs where EPR pairsare created locally and then the halves sent to entan-glement stations distributed among a sea of qubits [3].These entangled pairs would then be used to teleportqubits between memory storage and processing regions,circumventing the problem of directly transporting dataacross the whole computer. However, since the entangledpairs themselves are created locally and then the separatehalves physically moved to where they are required, thisneccessitates the use of quantum repeaters and extensivepurification. Furthermore in [3], all 49 qubits of a secondlevel encoded logical qubit are teleported requiring manyEPR pairs for transport in both directions.In this paper, we outline an proof-of-concept architec-ture based around an ion trap processing node containinga relatively small number of ions representing an encodedfirst level error corrected qubit, ancillas for fault-tolerant2MultiplexerPhotonDetectorsBeamsplittersNode 1 Node 2 Node 3 Node 4FIG. 2: Distributed Ion Trap Architecture.

The nodes are connected by optical fibre linking theinterface ions in each node. A heralded probablistic procedureentangles pairs of ions in separate nodes via interference andpath erasure. An optical multiplexer allows arbitrary pairsof nodes to be entangled, and parallel operation is achievedusing multiple beam-splitters and detectors.operation, and an interface ion which can be entangledwith its counterpart in another node (Fig. 1). An ab-stract basis of the scheme was suggested in [19], buthere we analyze a concrete realization, taking particu-lar attention to the requirements of error correction andfault-tolerant operation. In particular, we show how lo-cal and non-local logical operations can be reliably per-formed directly between two nodes via operator measure-ments, from which scaling to an arbitrary sized quantumcomputer follows. A small prototype is presented whichis within reach of current experiment.The paper is laid out as follows: The basic architectureis covered in Section II, the use of operator measurementsto implement gates is in Section IIA, the preparation ofencoded Bell states is in Section IIA 1, fault-tolerant im-plementation of non-local operators is in Section IIA 2,architecture scale-up is in Section II B, optimizing nodedesign is in Section III, and concluding remarks in Sec-tion IV.II. ARCHITECTUREThe basic architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. A net-work of local processing nodes are connected by opticalfibres and a multiplexing switch. In each trap node is asmall array of ions upon which conventional single andintra-trap two-qubit operations can be performed. Pairsof nodes can be optically linked to beamsplitters and sin-gle photon detectors which entangle the interface qubitswhen subjected to appropriate laser excitation and con-ditioned upon a correct sequence of detector clicks.

The fault-tolerant circuit first requiresthe preparation and verification of a four qubit GHZ state. Ifthe verification measurement = 1, then the ancilla block isreset and prepared again. To protect against Z errors in theancilla block, the circuit is repeated up to three times and amajority vote of the syndrome results is taken.A. OperationWe start off with all qubits initialized. Intra-trap op-erations are used to prepare encoded qubits. We assumethat each trap can hold a sufficient number of ions to en-code a logical qubit plus an appropriate number of ancillaions for error correction in at least the first level of con-catenation. Single qubit, non-trivial, logical operations(for example the T gate [20]) are performed with the as-sistance of ancilla qubits in the local trap. For inter-nodetwo-qubit logical operations, instead of directly interact-ing data qubits via the photonic bus, we instead createBell pairs spanning the nodes. By local operations andclassical communication (LOCC), two-qubit gates can beperformed without risking data loss between nodes.1. Inter-node operations and encoded Bell state preparationAs an example of inter-node operations, consider thepreparation of a logically encoded Bell state betweentwo separate nodes. Each node houses between sevenand fourteen ions depending on whether fault-toleranterror correction and gate operations are employed. Thedata ions in each trap will be encoded using the [[5,1,3]]code [21, 22], which is the smallest full quantum code,requiring five ions for a single logically encoded qubitprotected from at most one error. The stabiliser struc-3ture [23] for the [[5,1,3]] code, Ki i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, and thelogical bit (X¯) and phase (Z¯) operations are specified by,K1 = XZZXI, K2 = IXZZX,K3 = XIXZZ, K4 = ZXIXZ,X¯ = XXXXX, Z¯ = ZZZZZ. (1)Where X and Z are the Pauli σx and σz operators, I isthe 2× 2 identity matrix, and the tensor product is im-plied. Error correction using stabiliser codes is straight-forward [1, 22], each of the four generators Ki are mea-sured [Fig. 3(a)] either sequentially using a single ancilla,or simultaneously using four ancilla. Each of the sixteenpossible four-bit results represent one of the correctablesingle qubit errors, as well as the case where no error oc-cured. At a minimum, fault-tolerant measurement of thestabilisers requires a four qubit GHZ state as an ancillablock [Fig. 3(b)]. Additionally, a fifth qubit is used toverify the GHZ state against possible X errors which cansubsequently propagate to the data block. Therefore theminimum number of ions in a single trap needed for log-ical encoding and correction is six, while a total of tenions are needed to employ full fault-tolerant correctionsequentially.The interaction between logical qubits in separatenodes is mediated by interface ions entangled into Bellpairs by any one of a number of methods [24, 25, 26, 27].It has been shown that some two-qubit gates can be per-formed using Bell pairs via LOCC [12, 13, 28, 29]. Alarge class of quantum codes, known as Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, allow logical controlled-σx (CNOT)and controlled-σz (CZ) gates to be applied block-wise be-tween two data blocks, which are also inherently fault-tolerant. However, the [[5,1,3]] quantum code is not aCSS code and block-wise CNOT or CZ gates are notpossible. This also means that the more rapid methodof error correction introduced by Steane [30], requiring alarger ancilla block, will not work with the [[5,1,3]] code.However, a logical CNOT or CZ interaction between twological blocks of data can be performed for any code thatallows for block-wise single-qubit bit and/or phase op-erations using fewer interface qubits than the standardblock-wise approach. This method, first proposed in [31]and [32] uses the same basic element as error correction,namely operator measurements.A CZ gate between two qubits can be written in termsof operators on an arbitrary two qubit state |ψ〉 as,CZ|ψ〉 = 12(II + ZI + IZ − ZZ)|ψ〉. (2)To achieve this transformation on an arbitrary two-qubitstate, we append an ancilla qubit prepared in the state|+〉 = (|0〉 + |1〉)/√2, and measure the operators ZIZand IZX over the three qubit system. After these mea-surements, and assuming that the qubits are always pro-jected to a +1 eigenstate of these operators (otherwiselocal corrections can be applied), the final state is givenby12(III + ZIZ + IZX + ZZ(X.Z))|ψ〉|+〉. (3)Since the Pauli operators X and Z anti-commute andthat X |+〉 = |+〉 and Z|+〉 = |−〉, the state can be re-written as,12((II + IZ)|ψ〉|+〉+ (ZI − ZZ)|ψ〉|−〉), (4)after which the ancilla is then measured in the computa-tional basis. If the measurement result is |0〉, |ψ〉 is pro-jected to CZ|ψ〉, otherwise it is projected to (IZ).CZ|ψ〉upon which a local IZ correction is then applied.We use the above method to perform a logical CZacross two nodes. A single physical Bell state is pre-pared between two nodes each containing a logical qubit.Each half of the Bell state is used as a control qubit onthe respective data block of an encoded qubit. For ex-ample, to measure the logical Z¯Z¯ operator across twological blocks, local CZ gates are applied between eachBell pair qubit and the five ions representing the singlelogical qubit in each node. For a general state of twological qubits |ψ〉L, the transformation is1√2(|00〉+ |11〉)|ψ〉L → 1√2(|00〉II + |11〉Z¯Z¯)|ψ〉L, (5)where Z¯ is as in Eq.1, a logical phase gate for the [[5,1,3]]code. A local Hadamard gate is applied to both interfacequbits, leading to the state,12√21∑j,k=0|jk〉(II + (−1)j+kZ¯Z¯)|ψ〉L. (6)Measuring the parity of interface qubits projects the dataqubits into a ±1 eigenstate of Z¯Z¯ for an even/odd parityresult, hence performing the required measurement.Measuring an appropriate sequence of operators willenact a logical controlled phase rotation across two nodes.To perform the full CZ gate, an ancilla is needed whichis finally measured in the computational basis. This an-cilla does not need to be a fully encoded logical qubit inits own trap, it can just as easily be a single ion con-tained in either the control or target trap. However, tomaintain fault-tolerance this ancilla qubit should be en-coded. By using operator measurements between traps.inter-logical operations can be performed directly on the[[5,1,3]] encoded data using only one interface qubit pertrap.Localizing a single logical qubit plus appropriate an-cilla ions for local error correction has several advantages.Intra-trap operations have been demonstrated on up toeight ions [8] so local operations and error correctionshould suffer minimal overhead. Probabilistic entangle-ment generation [24, 25, 26, 27] does not pose a prob-lem for inter-node operations as local error correction4Non-FT: Measure K 1Non-FT: Measure K 2Non-FT: Measure K 3Non-FT: Measure K 4Non-FT: Measure K 1Prepare Bell LinkRepeat N TimesRepeat N TimesXXXXXXXXXXHH MMZZZZZCorrectionNon-FT: Measure K 2Non-FT: Measure K 3Non-FT: Measure K 4CorrectionEncodeEncodeION TRAP #1ION TRAP #2Non-FT: Measure K 1000000000000005 55 50000000000Non-FT: Encoded Bell State PreparationFIG. 4: Full quantum circuit for non-fault-tolerant, non-localpreparation of an encoded Bell state across two nodes. Fiveions in each trap are first encoded into the |0〉L state afterwhich local error correction is repeated continuously (say Ntimes) to protect against memory errors while the Bell linkis created. Once the Bell link is created, each interface ion isused as a control qubit for a blockwise X gate on each trap.The interface qubits are then measured locally and a classicalZ¯ gate is applied to the second trap if the measurement resulthas odd parity.

This is substantially more advantageous thanother highly distributed schemes [12] where all ions in-teract via these non-local linkages which would be highlysusceptible to memory errors while waiting for non-locallinks to be established. If required, local control per-mits the use of purification protocols in order to increaseinter-trap gate fidelity [19]. Also, by structuring all inter-logical operations such that they are mediated by entan-gled links, larger trap structures, for example the CCDdesign of Kielpinski et. al. [2], need only be designed,and optimized, for local error correction.From an experimental standpoint, the preparation ofa logically encoded Bell pair does not require the oper-ator CZ gate in full. If the initial state is |0〉L|0〉L, themeasurement of the operator X¯X¯ is sufficient to producethe state (|0〉L|0〉L + |1〉L|1〉L)/√2. Hence experimentaldemonstration of encoded Bell state preparation does notneed the third ancilla qubit required by the operator CZgate.Without maintaining fault-tolerance, we only requirefive (data block) + one (ancilla) + one (interface) ions pertrap to implement the protocol. Fig. 4 shows the com-plete quantum circuit required to implement the statepreparation non-fault-tolerantly, assuming that N fulllocal error correction cycles are performed in the timerequired to prepare the inter-trap Bell link.2. Fault-Tolerant encoded state preparation.This general method for preparing a distributed, en-coded Bell state is not fault-tolerant. Utilizing a singlequbit for correction allows errors to cascade into the datablock. Also, the Bell pair interface can induce logical er-rors if it is not prepared correctly.Maintaining fault-tolerance for local error correctionis fairly straightforward [1, 33]. The stabilizers for the[[5,1,3]] code have a maximum weight of four, hencethe ancilla ion used for correction is replaced with fiveions, four of which are prepared in the entangled state(|0000〉+|1111〉)/√2, after which the fifth is used to verifythe ancilla state against X errors that can propagate tothe data block. If verification fails, the ancilla block is re-set and re-prepared. Once the state is verified, each of thefour ancilla ions are coupled to the data block, with localCNOT and Hadamard gates (depending on the stabiliserstructure) and measured to determine the syndrome. Toprotect against Z errors, occurring or propagating to theancilla block, the syndrome is measured multiple times.At least two syndrome measurements are made, if theydisagree a third syndrome is measured and a majorityvote taken [Fig. 3(b)]. We adapt this general method tooperator measurement gates between traps.Errors in the Bell link between node, either duringpreparation or during operation, can lead to multiple er-rors propagating to the data blocks. For fault-tolerancewe again use several ancillas, thereby ensuring that onlyone ancilla qubit interacts with one qubit within thedata block. Measuring the operator U¯1 ⊗ U¯2, whereU¯j ∈ {X¯, Z¯}, requires a Bell link between the two nodesand the ability to perform CNOT or CZ gates betweeneach qubit in the Bell pair and their respective datablock. If an X error occurs on the Bell pair then thiscan propagate to possibly all of the qubits within one ofthe nodes. If this occurs, the single qubit error will in-duce a logical error. To counter this, we introduce severalmore ancilla qubits into each node and verify the inter-face qubit state before coupling ions to the data block.The required circuit needed to prepare a sufficient in-terface ancilla for the [[5,1,3]] code is shown in Fig 5.We use two Bell pairs and two additional ancilla qubitsin each node that are coupled to the original Bell pairthrough CNOT gates. After preparation, the ancillablocks of the two nodes are in the state,|An〉 = 12(|000〉1|000〉2+ |111〉1|111〉2)(|00〉v+ |11〉v) (7)The subscripts 1 and 2 represent the three ancilla qubitswithin each node, while the subscript v represents a sec-ond Bell link between the two nodes used for ancilla ver-ification. Now a CNOT gate is performed between thelast qubit in each node and the verification Bell state. Ifno errors have occurred then the CNOT operations willleave the verification Bell pair invariant. Considering allthe possible single X error locations during the prepa-ration of the ancilla state we find the following unique5XXXXPrepare Bell StatePrepare Bell StateXXMM00000000Repeat for odd parity measurement.ION TRAP #1ION TRAP #2FIG. 5: Circuit to prepare and verify the interface ancillablocks for fault-tolerant operator measurement on the [[5,1,3]]code. The ancilla state requires the preparation of two Belllinks between the separate data traps. After the local CNOTgates the second Bell link is measured. If the measurementresult has odd parity, the interface block is reset and re-prepared. Local error correction can be performed on eachdata block while waiting for a verified interface ancilla block.states are possible.|An〉 = 12(|000〉1|000〉2 + |111〉1|111〉2)(|01〉v + |10〉v),|An〉 = 12(|000〉1|111〉2 + |111〉1|000〉2)(|01〉v + |10〉v),|An〉 = 12(|000〉i|011〉j + |111〉i|100〉j)(|01〉v + |10〉v),|An〉 = 12(|000〉i|001〉j + |111〉i|110〉j)(|01〉v + |10〉v),(8)Where [i, j] ∈ {[1, 2], [2, 1]}. The verification qubits aremeasured in the computational basis and if an even par-ity result is obtained, then the ancilla state is verified,otherwise either the ancilla or verification qubits haveexperienced a single X error and we repeat the prepara-tion.The inclusion of the second Bell link between two nodesand the additional ancillas allows the verification of theancilla state prior to coupling it to the data qubits, pro-tecting the ancilla state from a single X error. Phaseerrors in the ancilla block result in an incorrect deter-mination regarding which eigenstate the data qubits areprojected to. To protect against this, the operator ismeasured two to three times and a majority vote taken.At each stage, error correction can be continuously per-formed on each data block while the interface ancillablock is prepared and verified.In Section IIA 1 we showed how the Bell link can al-low the measurement of a given Hermitian operator. Thisrequired performing a controlled operation from the Belllink qubits to each of the data qubits. For the [[5,1,3]]code, this allows for a logical X¯ and/or Z¯ operator mea-surement since these logical operations can be performedblock-wise. To maintain Fault-Tolerance, this would re-quire five ancilla qubits in each node connected to theBell pair. However we can reduce this to three in eachnode by exploiting the stabiliser structure of the [[5,1,3]]code.Any given logical state |ψ〉L encoded with the [[5,1,3]]code is stabilised by the operators K1 to K4. Therefore|ψ〉L = Ki|ψ〉L, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. If a logical Z¯ (X¯) op-eration is performed on the state, it is not necessary toapply five single qubit Z (X) gates, but we can redefinethe logical operators in terms of the stabilisers. Considerthe first stabiliser K1 = XZZXI. Then,Z¯|ψ〉L = Z¯K1|ψ〉L = (X.Z)II(X.Z)Z|ψ〉 (9)therfore only three operators, hence four ancilla qubits,are required for the interface block, instead of five.The total number of ions in each trap for full fault-tolerant local correction and coupling between the trapsis fourteen. Five ancilla ions are needed for local fault-tolerant error correction of the five ion logical qubits,while four ions are needed as the interface ancilla blockincluding two non-local Bell links, one to actually linkthe traps and one to verify the ancilla block. The totalnumber of qubits needed for this scheme and the num-ber of non-local Bell links for a general quantum code issignificantly less depending on the size of the code used.For a general, CSS, n qubit code correcting a single error,and assuming that no purification protocols are used, nBell links are required to perform a block-wise CZ gatein one time step. In contrast, this scheme only requirestwo Bell links (regardless of the code size) to perform aCZ gate in several time steps. In between each step, lo-cal error correction can be performed to protect againstmemory errors.B. Extending the scheme to larger architecturesThe above scheme of preparing a non-local encodedBell state between two separate nodes can easily be ex-tended to a much larger distributed system. Each nodewould be designed to house a single logical qubit, or sev-eral logical qubits for a general [[n,k,d]] code with k > 1.If multiple concatenation levels are warranted, then thenode system would also have the requisite number ofqubits and routing system to allow full Fault-Tolerant er-ror correction at all levels. The inter-logical operations,at the highest level of encoding are then performed usingthe non-local Bell links and the operator measurementprotocol. For a multiply concatenated (mth) level qubit,the operator measurement formalism can be extended ina straightforward manner.For all CSS codes, block-wise Z and X operations arepossible. Hence to measure these operators across two6nodes at the mth level of encoding, a CZ or CNOT gateis performed between each half of a Bell link pair of qubitsand all of the physical qubits in the two separately en-coded nodes. Fault-tolerance would require a similar an-cilla system as that used in the [[5,1,3]] example. Insteadof using two Bell links and four ancilla qubits per trap,the total number of ancillas will be equal toNumber of Ancilla = Wt(U¯)m + 1, (10)where m is the concatenation level and Wt(U¯) is theminimum weight of the n qubit operation that invokes ablockwise logical U operation on the kth qubit (if multiplequbits are encoded within a single node). The numberof Bell links required between nodes remains constant attwo, unless a quantum code is employed that encodesmultiple logical qubits. In this case inter-logical oper-ations between states located in different nodes will re-quire two Bell links for each pair of qubit interactionsbetween nodes. Figure 6 shows an example structurefor a distributed computer using the CCD trap design.Each CCD chip is designed exclusively for a single log-ical qubit encoded with the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. Eachchip houses seven data qubits, an additional 28 ancillaqubits which would allow for the simultaneous prepara-tion and verification of two separate ancilla blocks usingthe rapid method of Steane [30], and the four interfacequbits which are required for fault-tolerant operator mea-surements using the Steane code. Each chip is manufac-tured and characterized separately and would be pluggedin to the optical multiplexer, linking it to the rest of thecomputer.Within a larger architecture, the logical qubits neededfor a given quantum algorithm are interspersed with log-ically encoded ancilla traps that are then used to per-form logical CZ gates using the methods described inSection IIA 1.III. NODE DESIGNTo summarize the architecture, each node should sat-isfy the key requirements:• A sufficient number of long lived physical qubits foran error corrected logical qubit.• An additional number of ancilla qubits for errorcorrection and operator measurements. Measure-ment of these ancilla should be fast and reliable.The absolute coherence time of these ancilla maybe traded against fast operations.• A qubit which can be entangled with its counter-part in another node. This process can be proba-bilistic but heralded.• Fast and reliable single and two-qubit operationswithin the node for single logical qubit operations,error correction, operator measurements, and en-tanglement purification.OpticalMultiplexerSingle Level [[7,1,3]]QCCD Logical Qubit2 Ancilla BlocksInterface IonsData IonsQECAncillaIonsLogical Qubit NodeAncillaVerificationIonsSingle Level [[7,1,3]]QCCD Logical Qubit2 Ancilla BlocksSingle Level [[7,1,3]]QCCD Logical Qubit2 Ancilla BlocksSingle Level [[7,1,3]]QCCD Logical Qubit2 Ancilla BlocksFIG. 6: CCD micro-trap structure for a single logical qubitusing the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. Each chip houses 39 ions: 7data ions, 28 ancilla ions (allowing for simultaneous prepa-ration and verification of two ancilla blocks using Steane’srapid correction method [30]) and 4 interface ions for couplingto other logical qubits. The interface state required for the[[7,1,3]] code is identical to the [[5,1,3]] code since each of theseven dimensional stabilizers for the Steane code has weightfour, hence Wt(Z¯) = Wt(X¯) = 3. Each of these chip nodescan then be connected to the optical multiplexer, increasingthe total size of the quantum computer as needed.If multiple Bell links are required with a single node, thestate of the interface qubit can be swapped to an ancillaand the interface qubit re-entangled. Of course, multi-ple interface qubits would allow for parallel entanglingoperations but are not strictly necessary. Entanglementpurification may be required to increase the fidelity ofthe entangled links between traps. Nested entanglementpumping [36] reduces the number of ancilla required forhigh fidelity Bell pairs.Segmentation of a linear trap could be used to isolatethe interface ion from the rest of the trap until required.By suitable geometry, the interface region would not im-pinge on intra-trap operation, either by phonon couplingor photon scattering. When entanglement is needed, thetrap potentials are rearranged so that an ancilla ion couldbe placed into a common mode with the interface ion andquantum state transfer performed, afterwards which theancilla would be brought back to the rest of the ions forfurther processing.Though we have primarily considered a linear Paultrap as a node, one could replace it with any other small7qubit system as long as the above requirements are met,e.g. a CCD trap with an optical interface region as in Sec-tion II B. The Penning trap [37] has also been suggestedas a candidate for quantum computation, with hundredsor thousands of ions in a single two-dimensional Coulombcrystal [38, 39] and two-qubit gates via transverse phononmodes [40]. The large number of physical qubits wouldallow larger code words protecting against multiple errorsand/or optimised for different error models. However,the rotation of the crystal would complicate ion address-ing [51] and would restrict strong cavity coupling to thecentral ion [52].Within each node, the physical qubits play differentroles opening up the possibility of optimization of theirseparate properties. The data qubits require long coher-ence times, whilst we may want to optimise the ancillaqubits for fast operations and measurement. The inter-face qubit should have suitable optical properties for theentanglement generation procedure. In a Paul ion trap,different ionic species could be utilized and loaded in or-der by frequency selective ionization [43]. The use ofheavier ions (such as Cd+) for data storage may reducegate errors due to spontaneous decay from intermediatemetastable states [42], or else direct microwave drivingof hyperfine transitions could eliminate this entirely [44].Lighter ions could be used as ancilla in order to lower themass of the ion string and hence raise the axial phononfrequencies aiding cooling and two-qubit gate times.To reduce the number of ions in each node, the useof multiple levels in the ground hyperfine manifold toencode multiple qubits could be considered [45]. Sincemeasurement is likely to distinguish the state of all theencoded qubits of an ion, this method may not be suitablefor data qubits, but is not necessarily a drawback foruse for ancilla qubits which en bloc are measured andinitialized repeatedly.IV. CONCLUSIONWe have proposed the use of entanglement to di-rectly implement non-local operations between sepa-rately housed logical qubits. These ideas may also be ap-plicable to other physical quantum computing implemen-tations which satisify the requirements in Section III [53].The entanglement is created by a point-to-point processwhich reduces routing difficulties and enables parallel op-eration. Logical operations via operator measurementsrequire minimal entangled resources compared to a di-rectly teleported sequence of block-wise gates but stillretains fault tolerance. By keeping data local to a sin-gle node, the node can be of comparatively simple de-sign and size, optimized for local high fidelity operations.The technique should be able to be generalized to multi-qubit operations utilizing multi-partite entangled statesand may serve as the basis for a full scalable quantumcomputing architecture. A proof of principle demonstra-tion with two traps containing seven or eight ions andan optical interface each is within the reach of currentexperiment [8, 11]. Even simpler to demonstrate are op-erator measurement gates, the optical interface could beomitted and a gate performed between two three-qubitencoded (single X or Z-error) logical qubits coupled viaa single Bell pair. Such a distributed architecture is astrong alternative to monolithic designs.AcknowledgmentsDKLO acknowledges the support of the Cambridge-MIT Institute Quantum Information Initiative, EUgrants RESQ (IST-2001-37559) and TOPQIP (IST-2001-39215), EPSRC QIP IRC (UK), and Sidney Sussex Col-lege, Cambridge.

Whether the appellant's Petition for a Writ of Certiorari should be denied because it does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 46(c) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. COURT OF APPEALS' OPINION The Utah Court of Appeals' opinion in this case, Ashcroft v. Industrial Commission, 855 P.2d 267 (Utah App. 1993), is attached hereto as Addendum \"A.\" UTAH SUPREME COURT JURISDICTION The Utah Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari pursuant to Utah Code Ann. §§ 78-2-2(3)(a) (1992), 78-2-2(5) (1992), and Rule 45 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. CONTROLLING STATUTORY PROVISIONS The statutes which govern the Utah Supreme Court's acceptance of and deliberation upon a Petition for Writ of Certiorari are Utah Code Ann. §§ 78-2-2(3)(a) (1992) and 78-2-2(5) (1992), as well as Rule 45 and Rule 46 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. These provisions (attached hereto as Addendum \"B\") indicate that the Supreme Court's certiorari jurisdiction can be utilized to review decisions of the Utah Court of Appeals, but not decisions of Utah's administrative tribunals, when the following circumstances are present: Review by a writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, but of judicial discretion, and will be granted only for special and important reasons. The following, while neither controlling nor wholly measuring the Supreme Court's discretion, indicate the character of reasons that will be considered: (a) When a panel of the Court of Appeals has rendered a decision in conflict with the decision of another panel of the Court of Appeals on the same issue of law; (b) When a panel of the Court of Appeals has decided a question of 2 state or federal law in a way that is in conflict with the decision of the Supreme Court; (c) When a panel of the Court of Appeals has rendered a decision that has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings or has so far sanctioned such a departure by a lower court as to call for an exercise of the Supreme Court's power of supervision; or (d) When the Court of Appeals has decided an important question of municipal, state or federal law which has not been, but should be, settled by the Supreme Court. [Emphasis added.] (See Rule 4 6 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure attached hereto as Addendum \"B.\") Contrary to the contentions raised on page 2 of the appellant's Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Utah Code Ann. § 35-1-77 (1988) and Utah Industrial Commission Rule R568-1-9(A) (which deal with the Industrial Commission's use of medical panels) are not \"controlling statutes\" pertinent to the Utah Supreme Court's review of the Certiorari Petition. The Court of Appeals properly refused to even address whether the aforesaid statute and rule have any applicability to the appellant's assignment of Industrial Commission error. The Court's Ashcroft decision, attached as Addendum \"A,\" simply affirms the Industrial Commission's ruling that the appellant failed to come forward 3 with competent medical evidence in support of his claim of an impairment rating greater than 5%. Accordingly, the appellant's Certiorari Petition is nothing more than an attempt to demonstrate that the Court of Appeals somehow committed serious error in affirming the Industrial Commission's evidentiary rulings. Nowhere does the appellant's Certiorari Petition come close to demonstrating such error. Rather, the appellant focuses on § 35-1-77 and R568-1-9, and thereby improperly asks the Supreme Court to conduct a de novo review of the Industrial Commission's Final Order rather than an analysis of the Court of Appeals' opinion. His Certiorari Petition, therefore, fails to address the Rule 46 considerations deemed pertinent by the Utah Supreme Court. STATEMENT OF THE CASE A. Nature of the Case, Course of Proceedings, and Disposition Below. The above-entitled action derives from an industrial accident that occurred on September 25, 1989. (R. I.)1 Following Mr. Ashcroft's industrial injury, he and the appellees entered into a Compensation Agreement which included a xThe designation \"R. 1.\" refers to page 1 of the record on appeal transmitted by the Industrial Commission to the Utah Court of Appeals. 4 Stipulation indicating that Mr. Ashcroft had sustained a 5% permanent impairment due to his industrial accident. (See the parties' Compensation Agreement attached hereto as Addendum \"C.\") Following settlement of the claim, Mr. Ashcroft decided that he would ask the Industrial Commission to increase his permanent impairment rating and award him additional compensation and medical expense benefits. (R. 1.) After the submission of numerous medical records, and an Industrial Commission hearing conducted by Administrative Law Judge Lisa-Michele Church, an Order was entered denying the relief sought by Mr. Ashcroft. (R. 39.) (See the Administrative Law Judge's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order attached hereto as Addendum MD.fl) Mr. Ashcroft then filed a Motion for Review with the Industrial Commission (R. 47.) In his Motion, Mr. Ashcroft argued (without reference to any evidence contrary to his position) that the relief he had requested was generally supported by \"objective evidence.\" He also argued that the administrative law judge had committed prejudicial error in failing to submit the case to a medical panel when the medical evidence contained a supposed conflict between physicians' impairment ratings. Following its consideration of the record evidence, the Industrial Commission correctly found that no medical evidence conflict existed, and the Commission affirmed the administrative law judge's Order. 5 (R. 64.) (See the Industrial Commission's final Order attached hereto as Addendum \"E.\") Mr. Ashcroft then appealed the Industrial Commission's final Order (R. 69), and filed a Rule 10 Motion for Summary Disposition. (R. 106.) The Rule 10 Motion was denied. Following oral argument on the merits of the case, the Court of Appeals upheld the Industrial Commission's refusal to use a medical panel on the grounds that the appellant failed to come forward with competent medical evidence which could have justified referral of the evidence to a medical panel. (See Addendum \"A.\") The Court also concluded that the Industrial Commission erred when it used the phrase \"substantial evidence\" in reviewing the Administrative Law Judge's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order. Accordingly, the case was remanded to the Industrial Commission so that the appropriate \"preponderance of evidence\" standard of review could be applied. B. Statement of Background Facts. As a preliminary matter, appellees should point out that the \"Statement of Facts\" contained in the applicant's Certiorari Brief are not the facts which were adopted by the Industrial Commission or by the Court of Appeals. In the Statement of Facts outlined below, appellees present the pertinent facts as found by the Industrial Commission and as relied upon by the Court of Appeals. 6 On September 25, 1989, Mr. Ashcroft sustained an industrial injury while unloading freight from a truck. (R. 1.) Mr. Ashcroft promptly reported his injury and left work to seek medical treatment. In the emergency room, x-rays were taken, and Mr. Ashcroft was given muscle relaxants and pain medication. (No medical records are available from this visit.) Mr. Ashcroft then consulted with Dr. McGregor, his family physician, on September 28, 1989. (R. 130.) Dr. McGregor continued to see Mr. Ashcroft for two months. (R. 130.) Dr. McGregor's records indicate a diagnosis of bulging disc/spinal stenosis and refer the applicant to Dr. Bliss, a neurosurgeon. (R. 13 0.) Dr. Bliss saw Mr. Ashcroft on October 20, 1989, and diagnosed \". . . central disc herniation with minor spinal stenosis at this level.\" He recommended conservative treatment. (R. 146.) In December, 1989, Dr. Bliss noted Mr. Ashcroft's continuing bilateral leg pain and reviewed his myelogram and CT scan. (R. 150.) Dr. Bliss diagnosed \" . . . sciatica-like symptoms with central disc herniation and no definite evidence of neural impingement.\" Mr. Ashcroft was then referred to Dr. Moress for a neurological consult. (R. 150.) Dr. Moress saw Mr. Ashcroft on February 1, 1990 and recommended a complete myelography. (R. 155.) Dr. Bliss reviewed this 7 recommendation and noted \" . . . MRI scan of c. spine demonstrates multilevel disc disease. [Emphasis added.] Previous lumbar myelogram and CT scan demonstrated multiple level bulging discs without definite stenosis. [Emphasis added.]11 (R. 151.) Later in the same report, Dr. Bliss states, \"patient clearly interprets all of his problems as stemming from his recent accident although multiple level disc disease indicates that he has had pre-existing problems and in addition, back pain is not his major complaint at this time. [Emphasis added.]\" (R. 151.) On February 2, 1990, in response to an inquiry from the State Vocational Rehabilitation Office, Dr. Bliss described Mr. Ashcroft's status as \"medically stable for return to limited employment in nonlaboring activity.\" (R. 153.) Further, Mr. Ashcroft testified at his May 19, 1992 Industrial Commission hearing that he had applied for unemployment benefits in late 1989. (R. 41.) On April 12, 1989, Mr. Ashcroft consulted another orthopedic physician, Dr. Neal Capel. Dr. Capel recommended a program of conditioning for Mr. Ashcroft. (R. 158.) On May 10, 1990, Dr. Capel described a visit Mr. Ashcroft had made to the emergency room for intrascapular pain and noted, \" . . . [t]he most likely explanation is an anxiety reaction with somatization.\" (R. 159.) Dr. Capel continued to 8 recommend swimming, bicycle riding and general conditioning, noting that Mr. Ashcroft was to begin an architectural drafting course at Dixie College on May 22, 1990. (R. 159.) Dr. Capel's June 5, 1990 office note states, \" . . . [t]he patient has no change in his status and was given a work release. He has a job as a cook that is eminent [sic] and was given a release from the welfare department.11 (R. 160.) Mr. Ashcroft testified at the hearing that he did apply for the cook position, but following this work release he chose not to return to work and began attending school at Dixie College. (R. 41.) On July 12, 1990, Dr. Capel stated that the sitting required by Mr. Ashcroft's school activities was making him uncomfortable. He also had some aching muscles. (R. 161.) Later in the summer, Dr. Capel prescribed Xanax for Mr. Ashcroft's anxiety symptoms. (R. 162.) Mr. Ashcroft began working for his father in his father's grocery store in Arizona in September, 1990. (R. 163.) This job lasted a few weeks. Dr. Capel's September 20, 1990 office note states, \" . . . [h]e has found that the back did fairly well but his legs got tired as he was on his feet all day on concrete.\" (R. 163.) Dr. Capel continued to prescribe Xanax and Naprosyn. (Id.) Dr. Capel's notes for a November 13, 1990 visit indicate that Mr. Ashcroft was having back and leg pain, and had discontinued some 9 of his conditioning activities. (R. 164.) Dr. Capel's November 29, 1990 office notes describe a \"new episode\" of back pain occurring when Mr. Ashcroft lifted firewood and had a \". . . sudden onset of low back pain.\" (R. 165.) On the basis of this new episode, Dr. Capel diagnosed facet syndrome and low back strain. (Id.) At his January 29, 1991 office visit, Mr. Ashcroft reported to Dr. Capel that he had worked in his father's grocery store again during Christmas and experienced leg aches. (R. 166.) He requested a prescription of Ascendin, but Dr. Capel declined to prescribe it due to side effects. At Mr. Ashcroft's visit with Dr. Capel on March 15, 1991, Dr. Capel reported another new episode of back pain: \"The patient has been getting along reasonably well until March 14, 1991, when he bent down to clean up manure from his dog. He developed a sudden pain in the low back and had difficulty standing up straight.\" (R. 167.) Dr. Capel concluded that the applicant had had a recurrence of iliolumbar strain sprain and, \" . . . I further advised him that as far as the Industrial Commission is concerned, he is an administrative catch 22 situation where he cannot force them to assume care of his present complaint and while it is possibly associated in quality relation, it is a new episode.\" (R. 167.) 10 Following Dr. Capel's treatment, the applicant was examined by Dr. D. R. McNaught on May 8, 1991. (R. 174.) Dr. McNaught concluded that Mr. Ashcroft did have severe sciatica, due to the bulging of lumbar discs L4,5 and possibly LS. He recommended that the applicant investigate surgery, although Dr. McNaught expressed some reservations about that approach. (R. 189.) Mr. Ashcroft was not able to pursue surgical intervention on his back, due at least partially to the fact that he has Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The medical records indicate that Mr. Ashcroft tested positive for the HIV virus in the 1980s, and this condition has since developed into AIDS. Dr. Hagen has treated the applicant for AIDS since 1989. (R. 120.) He stated in a letter dated May 14, 1992, that the applicant's AIDS condition does not prevent him from conducting his normal activities; Dr. Hagan's records also indicate that he treated Mr. Ashcroft for a variety of conditions, and that Mr. Ashcroft was taking Prozac for depression. (R. 137.) Dr. McNaught referred the applicant to Dr. John Sanders for consideration of his back condition. (R. 190.) Dr. Sanders produced several reports, including one dated August 9, 1991 which concluded that surgical intervention was not warranted at that time, with no reference to the AIDS factors. (R. 190.) Dr. Sanders also wrote a one paragraph report dated October 7, 1991 stating: \". • 11 .It is my opinion that because he is unable to return to his usual work that he should have been given a disability rating of fifteen percent on that basis alone.\" (R. 193.) (See Addendum \"F.\") Dr. Boyd Holbrook performed a file review on the applicant's case on April 10, 1992, and found that the majority of his problems were not industrial in nature. (See Report attached as Addendum MG.ff) Dr. Holbrook stated in part, \" . . . [t]his man does have significant multi-level cervical disc disease that is not related to his industrial injury and is not being considered for any possible surgical treatment and appears to be a relatively minor portion of his symptom complex.\" (Id.) Dr. Holbrook stated that no further medical treatment was needed in connection with Mr. Ashcroft's 1989 injury, because \". . .it does not appear that more medical examinations or more diagnostic studies will assist in the delineation or management of his problem,\" and that Chymopapain injections are not advisable. (See Addendum \"G.\") Subsequently, on April 23, 1992, Dr. McNaught dictated an office progress note which indicates that \"I would have suggested a 10% disability . . . .\" (R. 177.) This \"disability rating\" (which Mr. Ashcroft now relies upon as a medically sound impairment rating) cites no medical records nor the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment for support. (See Dr. McNaught's office note attached hereto as Addendum \"H.\") 12 Mr. Ashcroft also sought c! i ropractic care from Dr. - - JO.\"I St. Geor~ ie cnxr-;---*\" ^ \"; as show the applica~*\" —.—:ved treatmeni. ::^ . ^ep^emb^ . .

POINT I APPELLANT'S CERTIORARI PETITION DOES NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 46(d) OF THE UTAH RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE In Point I of the Certiorari Brief, the applicant argues that Utah Code Ann. § 35-1-77 (1988) and Utah Industrial Commission Rule R568-1-9(A) required both the Industrial Commission and the Utah Court of Appeals to enter orders directing that a medical panel be convened to review the evidence submitted at the appellant's Industrial Commission hearing. Because the Industrial Commission refused to convene such a panel, and because the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed the Industrial Commission's Order, the appellant argues that the Utah Supreme Court must now exercise its certiorari jurisdiction so that it can instruct the lower courts in the proper use of medical panels. Unfortunately, the appellant has completely misread the Orders entered by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), the Industrial Commission, and the Utah Court of Appeals. The three rulings quite clearly indicate that § 35-1-77 and R568-1-9 have no relevance to the facts of this case because those provisions only come into play after the appellant has presented the Industrial Commission with competent medical evidence that can, as a threshold 14 matter, give rise to the need for - ied i cai Dane I.

Consistent with Price River and Jensen, the Court of Appeals7 Ashcroft opinion merely defers to the Industrial Commission in its assessment as to whether the medical evidence in this case was sufficient to give rise to the need for medical panel assistance.2 There is no factual or legal basis, therefore, for the appellant's Certiorari Petition under Rule 46(d). Appellant's sole argument during the Industrial Commission proceedings below was that a medical panel needed to be convened in this case due to an alleged 5% difference in permanent impairment ratings assigned to the appellant by different physicians.3 A brief review of the evidence analyzed by the Industrial Commission amply demonstrates that the appellant has never had a meritorious argument supporting his request for medical panel referral. Indeed, the administrative law judge properly observed that the so-called 2It should be observed that the Ashcroft opinion is narrowly limited to the facts of the present case and will not generally extend to those cases where an injured worker or his attorney has provided the Industrial Commission with competent medical evidence. 3Appellant's arguments that a panel had to be convened due to the Industrial Commission's use of \"summary medical forms\" and due to conflicting medical expense and medical stabilization evidence are arguments that were never raised at any stage of the Industrial Commission proceedings! Clearly, such hindsight arguments (which the appellant obviously wishes he could have made to the Court of Appeals) cannot now be considered for the first time in a Rule 46 certiorari context.

Given the insufficiency of Dr. Sanders' and Dr. McNaught's \"ratings\", the administrative law judge/ the Industrial Commission, and the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that Mr. Ashcroft wholly failed to shoulder his burden of proof (imposed by a long line of Utah cases including Allen v. Industrial Commission, 729 P.2d 15 (Utah 1986)); Mr. Ashcroft simply failed to submit to the Industrial Commission any records containing a well supported impairment rating. (See page 7 of Addendum \"D.\") Because of the deference the Court of Appeals affords to Industrial Commission findings of fact, and based on the \"reasonableness\" standard of review governing the Court's subject evidentiary issue (under Morton International v. Auditing Div., 814 P.2d 581 (Utah 1991)), the Industrial Commission's final Order was properly affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Finally, given all of the new arguments the applicant has raised for the first time at the certiorari stage, the appellant is really asking the Supreme Court to grant him a de novo review of the Industrial Commission's final Order. However, as this Court recently stated in Butterfield v. Okubo, 831 P.2d 97, 101, fn. 2 (1992) : 18 We take tnis opportunity to remind the Bar that when exercis ing our certiorarI j urisdicti on granted by section 78-2-2 (3) (a), we review a decision of the Court of Appeals, not of the trial court. See Utah Code Ann. § 78-2-2(3)(a). Therefore, the briefs of the parties should address the decision of the Court of Appeals, not the decision of the trial court. To re-state the matter: We do not grant certiorari to review de novo the trial court's decision. See Utah R.App.P. 46.

More specifically, the appellant contends that he properly preserved an insufficiency of the evidence issue below and that the Court of Appeals' opinion should be reversed due to the Court's conclusion that: . . • we deem that Ashcroft has waived the issues of sufficiency of the evidence and adequacy of the ALJ's findings and that he cannot now raise them for the first time on petition for judicial review. (See Addendum \"A\" at pp. 268-69.) The appellant's Rule 46(c) argument lacks merit and should be denied for three reasons. First, the appellant's argument should be seen for what it is. All that the appellant is asking the Supreme Court to do is re-examine the Motion for Review he filed with the Industrial Commission on the grounds that the judges sitting on the Court of Appeals bench are apparently incompetent when it comes to evaluating lower court pleadings and determining whether certain legal issues have been raised in those pleadings. Appellant's argument must fail. The Court of Appeals is amply competent to examine an Industrial Commission Motion for Review and determine whether a legal argument (such as a sufficiency of the evidence argument) is contained in the pleading. The Court of Appeals conducted this examination, and then very clearly stated that the appellant's Motion for Review does not contain a sufficiency of the evidence challenge.

Without undertaking the marshalling process, the appellant never began to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underpinning the Administrative Law Judge's final Order. Again, a Writ of Certiorari should not be granted under Rule 46(c) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. Third, the appellant mistakenly refers to Rule 49(a)(4) of the Utah Rules of Appellant Procedure in arguing that this Court should grant his requested Writ. Rule 49(a)(4) — which provides that a statement of a certiorari issue will be deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein\" — applies only in a context of a certiorari proceeding. The Rule cannot be used to somehow suggest that the appellants' Motion for Review filed with the Industrial Commission must be read in such an overly broad fashion that it can be deemed to contain a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. In short, the appellant simply has no factual or legal basis for arguing that he legitimately raised a sufficiency of the evidence challenge.

Peter-son, Salt Lake City, for Airfax Exp., Inc., and Liberty Mut Ins. Co. Benjamin A. Sims, Salt Lake City, for Indus. Com'n. Before GARFF, GREENWOOD and ORME, JJ. OPINION GARFF, Judge: --Petitioner, Denis Ashcroft, seeks review by this court of an Industrial Commission order denying him workers compensation benefits. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. FACTS ' -'On September 25, 1989, Ashcroft sus-tained an industrial injury while unloading freight from a truck. The employer's com-pensation insurer paid temporary total dis-ability benefits from September 26, 1989 through June 5, 1990 as well as compensa-tion for a five percent permanent partial impairment On September 26, 1991, Ashcroft peti-tioned for additional temporary disability compensation, an increased permanent par-tial disability rating and medical expenses. Ashcroft alleged that the same September 25, 1989 industrial injury rendered him un-able to work. -After a formal hearing, the administra-tive law judge (ALJ) denied Ashcroff s claim. The ALJ did not convene a medical panel, despite a request by both parties' counsel to do so. The ALJ discounted con-elusory statements of two expert witnesses regarding Ashcroft's impairment ratings: Dr. Capel merely recites what the insur-ance adjustor was offering and post-pones a rating; Dr. Sanders makes a conclusory statement of 15% without ref-erence to any underlying facts or indus-trial cause. The ALJ made findings of fact and con-clusions of law, which the Commission es-sentially adopted. She determined that \"the true cause of [Ashcroft's] continuing problems stem from pre-existing degenera-tive problems, intervening non-industrial events, and unrelated health conditions. Therefore, his claim fails for lack of medi-cal and legal causation/' Ashcroft moved the Industrial Commis-sion for review. In his motion, Ashcroft failed to raise issues regarding sufficiency of the evidence and adequacy of the ALJ's findings, concentrating his administrative appeal on the ALJ's refusal to convene a medical panel The Commission, after adopting the AU's findings, affirmed the ALJ's denial of benefits. Ashcroft now seeks review of the Commission's denial. ' PRESERVATION OF ISSUES [1] We first consider the threshold is-sue of whether Ashcroft properly pre-served for review the issues he now raises, namely issues of sufficiency of the evi-dence, standard of proof and adequacy of the AU's findings, given that he failed to raise these issues before the Commission. Pease v. Industrial Comm'n, 694 P.2d 613 (Utah 1984) is dispositive. The Pease court held that a petitioner, in moving for review, has \"the obligation to raise all the issues that could have been presented at that time, and those issues not raised [are] waived.\" Id. at 616; accord Smallwood v. Industrial Comm'n, 841 P.2d 716, 718 n. 1 (Utah App.1992). The rationale is that by raising an issue at the administrative level, \"either the administrative law judge or the Commission could have adjudicated the is-sue.\" Pease, 694 P.2d at 616. Ashcroft failed to raise the above issues before the Commission. Of those issues, all except for his claim that the Commis-sion employed the wrong standard of proof, are claims that could have been pre-sented to the Commission. See id. Thus, we deem that Ashcroft has waived the is-ASHCROFT v. INDUSTRIAL COftTN OF UTAH Utah 269 Cite o 853 POd 267 (UtahApp. 1993) sues of sufficiency of the evidence and adequacy of the ALJ's findings and that he cannot now raise them for the first time on petition for judicial review. Id. Ashcroft could not have raised the claim that the Commission employed the wrong standard of proof until after the Commission had made its review. Thus, this claim is prop-erly before this court even though it is raised for the first time on judicial review. STANDARD OF PROOF [2] Ashcroft claims the Commission ap-plied the wrong standard of proof when it denied his motion for review. In its review of the ALJ's decision, the Commission em-ployed the phrase \"substantial evidence.\" This is not the correct standard. The quan-tum of evidence required to prove compens-ability is a preponderance of the evidence. Lipman v. Industrial Comm'n, 592 P.2d 616, 618 (Utah 1979). The distinction between preponderance of evidence and substantial evidence is sig-nificant A reviewing body, such as this court, applies the standard of substantial evidence to examine whether the record contains evidence supporting the findings made by the trier of fact The reviewing court does not weigh the evidence, in con-trast a trier of fact including the Commis-sion, determines whether the petitioner has met his or her burden of proof, the stan-dard being preponderance of the evidence. The Commission's mistake as to the stan-dard of proof is not one of mere phraseolo-gy. Both Ashcroft and this court are enti-tled to know that his proof was evaluated under the correct standard. We therefore remand the claim for the Commission to evaluate it under the stan-dard of preponderance of the evidence. MEDICAL PANEL Ashcroft claims the Commission acted unreasonably and irrationally in not con-vening a medical panel. Ashcroft pre-served this issue by including it in his mo-tion for review before the Commission. See Pease v. Industrial Comm'n, 694 P.2d 613, 616 (Utah 1984). [3] The \"Commission may refer the medical aspects of [a workers compensa-tion] case to a medical panel appomted by the Commission.\" Utah Code Ann. § 35-1-77(lXa) (1992) (emphasis added). This stat-utory language is permissive, not mandato-ry. See Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Industrial Comm'n, 839 P.2d 841, 845 (Utah App.1992). Pursuant to section 35-l-77(lXa), the Commission enacted Rule 568-1-9 as a guideline in determining if a medical panel should be convened. In contrast to the statute, the wording of the agency rule is mandatory: A. A panel will be utilized by the Ad-ministrative Law Judge where: 1. One or more significant medical is-sues may be involved. Generally a sig-nificant medical issue must be shown by conflicting medical reports/ Significant medical issues are involved when there are: (a) Conflicting medical reports of per-manent physical impairment which vary more than 5% of the whole person, Utah Code Admin.P. R568-1-9 (emphasis added). Thus, the rule requires the Com-mission to convene a medical panel when the evidence supports conflicting industrial impairment ratings with more than a five percent difference. If the evidence regard-ing impairment ratings supports ratings that vary by more than five percent as petitioner asserts, a medical panel would be necessary to resolve the differences. In short the statute explicitly grants dis-cretion to the Commission as to whether to convene a medical panel. The Commission, in turn, restricted its own discretion by promulgating the Rule requiring it to con-vene a medical panel in certain instances. [4,51 Our review is pursuant to Utah Code Ann. § 63-46b-16(4)(h)(ii) (1987) be-cause this issue requires us to consider whether the agency acted contrary to its own rule. Thus, \"we will not disturb the agency's interpretation or application of the [rule] unless its determination exceeds the bounds of reasonableness and rationali-270 u t a h 855 PACIFIC REPORTER, 2d SERIES ty.\" King v. Industrial Comm'n, 850 P.2d 1281, 1286 (Utah App.1993).1 . Here, the Commission determined: The bald statement by Dr. Sanders, in connection with his assertion that a 15 percent rating was appropriate, was sup-ported by absolutely no medical analysis or logic. We need some justification, and in the absence of such, we cannot specu-late. In the case of Dr. Capel, there is no statement by him as to any appropri-ate rating, other than a statement that the adjuster had decided upon a five per-cent rating. We therefore conclude that the evidence does not support the appli-cant in this regard. In short, the Commission found no specific or supported impairment rating in the rec-ord, much less conflicting impairment rat-ings. Nor did the Commission find that the ratings given related to an industrial cause. Thus, there was no departure from the agency rule because the agency rule did not apply. Therefore, we need not consider whether any departure was reasonable and rational. CONCLUSION Ashcroft could have, but failed to raise the issues of sufficiency of the evidence and adequacy of the AU's findings. We therefore deem that he has waived those issues. We affirm the AU's refusal to convene a medical panel as reasonable and rational because the A U found no specific or supported impairment rating in the rec-ord. On the other hand, we cannot affirm the Commission's decision because the Commission employed the wrong standard of proof in its review of the evidence. We therefore reverse the Commission's order and remand for the Commission to conduct a review employing the proper standard of preponderance of the evidence. 1. In the event we determine an agency has in fact departed from its own rule, we would then consider whether the departure was reasonable and rational.

Commission Conference Room, Washington County Commission offices, 197 East Tabernacle, St. George, Utah on May 19, 1992, at 9:00 o'clock a.m. Said hearing pursuant to Order and Notice of the Commission. The Honorable Lisa-Michele Church, Administrative Law Judge. The applicant was present and represented by Bruce Wilson, Attorney at Law. The defendants were represented by Michael Dyer, Attorney at Law. This is a claim for additional temporary total disability compensation and medical expenses in connection with a 9/25/89 industrial injury. The defendant insurance carrier denies liability on the basis of medical and legal causation. An evidentiary hearing was held, during which oral and written evidence was presented. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the matter was taken under advisement by the Administrative Law Judge. Having been fully advised in the premises, the Administrative Law Judge now enters the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. FINDINGS OF FACT: The applicant in this matter, Denis Ashcroft, was employed as a driver for Airfax Express in 1989, earning 18 cents per mile. He was unmarried with no dependent children at the time of his injury. n ^ DENIS ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE TWO On September 25, 1989, the applicant was unloading boxes with a dolly to persons on the ground at a Salt Lake K-Mart location, and he bent over and could not straighten up. He felt pain in his back, crawled to the edge of the truck bed and called his employer. His employer told him to finish unloading, but Ashcroft had the store employees do it for him. He then drove to another K-Mart and did the same. Ashcroft drove to Ogden, parked the truck, and took a taxi to the McKay Dee Hospital Emergency Room. At the emergency room, they took x-rays, gave him muscle relaxants and pain medication. No medical records were available from this visit. Thereafter the applicant rode the bus back to St. George. There, he consulted Dr. McGregor, his family doctor, on September 28, 1989 (Ex. D-01, p. 5). Dr. McGregor advised complete bed rest and continued to see him for two months. Dr. McGregor's records indicate a diagnosis of bulging disc/spinal stenosis and refer the applicant to Dr. Bliss, a neurosurgeon. Dr. Bliss saw the applicant on October 20, 1989, and diagnosed, \". . . central disc herniation with minor spinal stenosis at this level.11 He recommended conservative treatment. (Ex. D-l, p. 19.) In December, 1989, Dr. Bliss noted Ashcroft's continuing bilateral leg pain and reviewed his myelogram and CT scan. He stated his impression was \"• . • sciatica-like symptoms with central disc herniation and no definite evidence of neural impingement.\" The applicant was then referred to Dr. Moress for a neurological consult. Dr. Moress saw Ashcroft on February 1, 1990 and recommended a complete myelography. Dr. Bliss reviewed this recommendation and noted w. . . [Dr. Moress] suspects possible demyelinating disorder if symptoms are not explained by stenosis. MRI scan of c. spine demonstrates multilevel disc disease. Previous lumbar myelogram and CT scan demonstrated multiple level bulging discs without definite stenosis.H Later in the same report, Dr. Bliss stated, H. . . Patient clearly interprets all of his problems as stemming from his recent accident although multiple level disc disease indicates that he has had pre-existing problems and in addition, back pain is not his major complaint at this time.11 (Ex. D-l, p. 24.) On February 2, 1990, in response to an inquiry from State Vocational Rehabilitation, Dr. Bliss described Ashcroft's status as M. . . medically stable for return to limited employment in non-laboring activity.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 26.) The applicant testified •- C40 DENIS ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE THREE that he applied for and was denied unemployment benefits in late 1989, due to a prior lien. On April 12, 1990, the applicant consulted another orthopedic physician, Dr. Neal Capel. Dr. Capel saw him on 4/12/90 and recommended a program of conditioning for Ashcroft. In the notes of that visit, Dr. Capel also mentioned, \". . . Liberty Mutual account manager determined his permanent partial disability as 5%, March 26, 1990, is the cutoff of benefits.The patient will have his disability rating deferred until the conclusion of his work hardening and conditioning in 6 weeks.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 32.) At the May 10, 1990, visit with the applicant, Dr. Capel described a visit Ashcroft had made to the emergency room for intrascapular pain and noted, \" . . . The most likely explanation is an anxiety reaction with somatization.\" Dr. Capel continued to recommend swimming, bicycle riding and general conditioning. At the June 5, 1990, visit, Dr. Capel's office notes state, \". . . The patient has no change in his status and was given a work release. He has a job as a cook that is eminent [sic] and was given a release from the welfare department.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 34.) Ashcroft testified he did apply for the cook position. Following this work release however, the applicant did not return to work, but began attending school at Dixie College. At the July 12, 1990, office visit, Dr. Capel stated that sitting required by the applicants school activities was making him uncomfortable. He also had some aching muscles. Later in the summer, Dr. Capel prescribed Xanax for Ashcroft's anxiety symptoms. Ashcroft began working for his father in his grocery store in Arizona in September, 1990. This job lasted a few weeks. Dr. Capel/s notes state, \". . .He has found that the back did fairly well but his legs got tired as he was on his feet all day on concrete.\" Dr. Capel continued to prescribe Xanax and Naprosyn. (Ex. D-l, p. 37.) Dr. Capel's notes for November 13, 1990, visit indicate that Ashcroft was having back and leg pain, and had discontinued some of his conditioning activities. His November 29, 1990, office notes describe a \"new episode\" of back pain occurring when Ashcroft lifted firewood and had, \". . . sudden onset of low back pain.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 39.) Dr. Capel diagnosed facet syndrome and low back strain. The applicant testified that this episode involved him lifting two or three pieces of wood branches that would fit in his fireplace. 041 DENIS ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE FOUR At his January 29, 1991, office visit, the applicant reported to Dr. Capel that he had worked in his father's grocery store again during Christinas and experienced leg aches. He requested a prescription of Ascendin, but Dr. Capel declined to prescribe it due to side effects. At Ashcroft's visit with Dr. Capel on March 15, 1991, Dr. Capel reported another episode of back pain: MThe patient has been getting along reasonably well until March 14, 1991, when he bent down to clean up manure from his dog. He developed a sudden pain in the low back and had difficulty standing up straight.11 Dr. Capel concluded that the applicant had had a recurrence of iliolumbar strain sprain and, \". . .1 further advised him that as far as the Industrial Commission is concerned, He is an administrative catch 22 situation where he cannot force them to assume care of his present complaint and while it is possibly associated in quality relation, it is a new episode.\" (Ex. D-l, p. 41.) Ashcroft testified that he was using a 3/4 length shovel and bent over and felt back pain. He then had difficulty straightening up. Following Dr. Capel's treatment, the applicant was examined by Dr. D.R. McNaught on May 8, 1991. Dr. McNaught concluded that Ashcroft did have severe sciatica, due to the bulging of lumbar discs L4,5 and possibly LS. He recommended that the applicant investigate surgery, although Dr. McNaught expressed some reservations about that approach. In fact, the applicant was not able to pursue surgical intervention on his back, due at least partially to the fact that he has Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. (Ex. D-l, p. 61-62.) The medical records indicate that Ashcroft tested positive for the HIV virus in the 1980s, and this condition has since developed into AIDS. (Ex. D-l, p. 10-17.) Dr. Hagen has treated the applicant for AIDS since 1989. He stated in a letter dated May 14, 1992, that the applicant's AIDS condition does not prevent him from conducting his normal activities, (Ex. A-l). Hagan's records also indicate that he treated Ashcroft for a variety of conditions, and that Ashcroft was taking Prozac for depression. Dr. McNaught referred the applicant to Dr. John Sanders for consideration of his back condition. Dr. Sanders produced several reports, including one dated August 9, 1991, which concluded that surgical intervention was not warranted at that time, with no reference to the AIDS factors. Dr. Sanders also wrote a one paragraph report dated October 7, 1991 stating: \". . .It is my opinion that because he is unable to return to his usual work that 04? DENIS ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE FIVE he should have been given a disability rating of fifteen percent on that basis alone,H (Ex. D-l, p. 66.) Dr. Boyd Holbrook performed a file review on the applicant's case on April 10, 1992, and found that the majority of his problems were not industrial in nature. Dr. Holbrook stated in part, H. . . This man does have significant multi-level cervical disc disease that is not related to his industrial injury and is not being considered for any possible surgical treatment and appears to be a relatively minor portion of his symptom complex.11 Dr. Holbrook opined that no further medical treatment was needed in connection with Ashcroft's 1989 injury, that, w. . .it does not appear that more medical examinations or more diagnostic studies will assist in the delineation or management of his problem,\" and that Chymopapain injections are not advisable, (Ex. D-l, p. 67). Ashcroft also sought chiropractic care from Dr. Wageman in St. George. Those chiropractic records show the applicant received treatments from September 27, 1991, through December, 1991 for 35 visits. Dr. Wageman believed that Ashcroft suffered, \". . .an exacerbation of his post-traumatic injuries sustained in the original accident,H of 1989 (Ex. A-l). The applicant's medical records indicate that he has undergone the following diagnostic procedures since his industrial injury: x-rays (10/89), CT scan (10/89), myelogram-CT scan (12/89), MRI (2/90), CT scan (5/91), x-rays (10/91), MRI (10/91). The applicant currently experiences aches in his back and legs. He takes AZT, wellbutrin and dalmane, as well as headache medicines. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW: The applicant in this matter, Denis Ashcroft, unfortunately has failed to sustain his burden of proof that further temporary total disability benefits or medical expense benefits are causally related to his industrial accident of 1989. In fact, according to medical specialists, the true cause of the applicant's continuing problems stem from pre-existing degenerative problems, intervening non-industrial events, and unrelated health conditions. Therefore, his claim fails for lack of medical and legal causation. At the time of the hearing, there was no evidence that Ashcroft was unable to work during the period of his additional temporary total disability claim. The applicant testified that he r>43 DENIS ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE SIX applied for unemployment, applied for a job as a cook, and in fact, attended school full-time. He also worked in his father's grocery store for a time. Two doctors had released him to work (Dr. Bliss, 2/2/90) (Dr. Capel, 6/5/90) and considered him medically stable. No other medical provider has taken him off work. Utah workers compensation law is specific on this issue, lf. . . Once a claimant reaches medical stabilization, the claimant is moved from temporary to permanent status and he is no longer eligible for temporary benefits.11 Booms v. Rapp Construction, 720 P.2d 1363, 1366 (Utah 1986.) Lack of stabilization is the plaintiff's burden to prove, Griffith v. Industrial Commission. 754 P.2d 981 (Ct. of App. Utah 1988) . Applicant's counsel argues that Ashcroft is entitled to further benefits while he is still in the \"diagnostic\" stage of his treatment for his back injury. Unfortunately, the medical records clearly indicate that this case has long ago exhausted the diagnostic stage. In fact, the applicant has been seen by at least six specialists, and has had every possible diagnostic test performed at least twice for his back pain symptoms. The case is also tragically complicated by the presence of the applicant's AIDS condition, which may not have become a \". . .severe medical problem,\" but ultimately is life-threatening and therefore bound to influence the applicant's choices with regard to surgery, employment, as well as any optional medical treatment. Further, the medical records in this file indicate that the applicant's case involves psychological components. Moreover, when carefully reviewed, it is illogical for one to attempt to pin all the troublesome circumstances of a situation on a single incident of lumbar strain several years ago, particularly when that condition stabilized within months and was one which the doctors refused to surgically treat. Applicant's counsel further argues that the applicant may fall into the rare category of one who suffers a sacroiliac condition that is difficult to diagnose. There is no indication, however, of that suspicion on behalf of Ashcroft's numerous physicians. Such arguments are speculative and general, and cannot be the basis of extending workers compensation benefits indefinitely to the applicant. The Administrative Law Judge agrees with Ashcroft's physicians who have identified this case as a complex one, involving pre-existing and psychological factors. In addition, the applicant experienced two subsequent non-industrial events which occurred when his doctor said he was doing well. The improvement he was DENIS ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE SEVEN making, together with the strenuous nature of the incidents themselves, render those subsequent events intervening and causally contributing to his continuing back problems. As to the permanent partial impairment rating, the applicant was paid compensation on a 5% whole person permanent partial disability rating by the defendants. The Administrative Law Judge does not find a specific rating in the records: Dr. Capel merely recites what the insurance adjustor was offering and postpones a rating; Dr. Sanders makes a conclusory statement of 15% without reference to any underlying facts or industrial cause. Without a well-supported rating in the record, and the Administrative Law Judge can only note that a 5% impairment is reasonable for an unoperated disc problem according to the AMA Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Table 53. ORDER: IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the claim of the applicant, Denis Ashcroft, for additional temporary total disability and medical expenses compensation in connection with his industrial injury of September 25, 1989, should be and is hereby denied for lack of legal and medical causation. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any Motion for Review of the foregoing shall be filed in writing within thirty (30) days of the date hereof, specifying in detail the particular errors and objections, and, unless so filed, this Order shall be final and not subject to review or appeal.

The applicant's claim asks for additional compensation and payments in connection with medical expenses, temporary total compensation (TTC), permanent partial compensation (PPC), travel expenses, interest, and medical treatment as a result of his back injury on September 25, 1989. The administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that the applicant had failed to show legal and medical causation, and therefore denied his claim. It is from this denial that the applicant appeals based on allegations of the following errors: 1. Rejection by the ALJ of two permanent partial disability ratings in favor of a two year old rating done by the \"Liberty Mutual account manager.\" 2. The failure of the ALJ to order that a medical panel be convened to consider among other items the question of maximum medical improvement. 3. The ALJ did not consider that the treating doctors were in the diagnostic stages of the case, and the doctors had not decided upon a course of treatment. 4. The ALJ lost or ignored the chiropractor's results that the applicant was improving with chiropractic treatment. 5. This case contains objective evidence of several radiographically verified disc injuries, and surgery was a \"clear possibility but for the complication of the AIDS.\" The respondents argue in rebuttal that the medical evidence did not give rise to the need for a medical panel review, and that there is no conflict in the medical evidence regarding the applicant's attainment of maximum medical improvement. We will DENIAL OF MOTION FOR REVIEW Case No. 91000984 061 ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE TWO briefly discuss the pertinent facts as they relate to the allegations of error. There seems to be no dispute about the basic facts of the original industrial injury, in 1989. At that time, the applicant was a driver for Airfax Express. On September 25, 1989, he was using a dolly to unload boxes at a K-Mart. He bent over, and could not thereafter stand straight. Experiencing pain in his back, he crawled to the edge of his truck, and called his employer. His employer told him to finish unloading.1 He apparently was able to have the K-Mart employees complete the task, and he subsequently drove to another K-Mart where he was again able to have its employees do the same. The applicant then drove to Ogden, parked his truck, and used a taxi to get to a hospital emergency room. The emergency room treatment and procedures consisted of x-rays, muscle relaxants, and pain medication. After a trip back to St. George by bus, the applicant was treated by his family doctor, Dr. McGregor, on September 28, 1989. After a period of bed rest, the applicant was seen by the doctor during the following two months. Dr. McGregor diagnosed the applicant as having bulging disc/spinal stenosis. The doctor referred the applicant to Dr. Bliss, a neurosurgeon. Dr. Bliss saw the applicant on a number of occasions during the period October 20, 1989 through February 20, 1990. The doctor recommended that the applicant receive conservative treatment, and stated that \".Patient clearly interprets all of his problems as stemming from his recent accident although multiple level disc disease indicates that he has had pre-existing problems and in addition, back pain is not his major complaint at this time.\" Exhibit D-l, at 24. Further, the doctor concluded on February 2, 1990 that the applicant was w.medically stable for return to limited employment in nonlaboring activity.11 I£., at 26. During the period April 12, 1990 through March 15, 1991, the applicant was treated by Dr. Capel. Dr. Capel placed the applicant on a work hardening and conditioning program. On May 10, 1990, the applicant experienced intrascapular pain, and went to an emergency room for treatment. The doctor explained this episode as an anxiety reaction with somatization, and recommended general conditioning, bicycle riding, and swimming. On June 5, 1990, the applicant was given a work release, and apparently told the doctor that he had an imminent job as a cook. Apparently, the applicant did not return to work, but instead attended Dixie College as a student. Between July 12, 1990, and March 15, 1991, the applicant 063 ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE THREE experienced muscle aches, back and leg pain, and anxiety symptoms on various occasions. Low back pain appeared after the applicant lifted two or three pieces of firewood, and a second episode occurred when the applicant attempted to clean up some of his dog's excrement. Dr. Capel noted on November 13, 1990 that the applicant had discontinued some of his conditioning exercises. It appears that surgery is either not warranted for the applicant's medical problems, or is not recommended due to AIDS which has developed in the applicant from his initial contact with the HIV in the 1980's. Although one doctor recommended that the applicant investigate surgery (Dr. McNaught), another (Dr. Hunter) indicated that some surgery may be possible, two other doctors have indicated that surgery is not warranted (Dr. Holbrook and Dr. Sanders) . Dr. Holbrook reviewed the applicant's file and concluded that the majority of the applicant's problems were not industrial in nature. The doctor concluded that additional medical examinations or diagnostic studies will not assist in the \"delineation or management of [the applicant's] problem [in connection with the 1989 injury.M Exhibit D-l at 67. Contrary to the view of Dr. Holbrook, and others, is that of a treating chiropractic physician, Dr. Wageman, who believed that the applicant suffered \".an exacerbation of his post-traumatic injuries sustained in the original accident.\" of 1989. Exhibit A-l. We have concluded that the specialists who determined that the applicant's problems were not industrial in nature outweigh the opinion of Dr. Wageman. The ALJ concluded that the applicant had failed to sustain his burden of proof that he was further entitled to TTC or to medical expense benefits. There is substantial evidence in the file in light of the entire record to show that the applicant's continuing problems result from conditions unrelated to the industrial accident. Thus, the applicant has failed to show medical and legal causation. Under these circumstances, no medical panel is necessary. The file shows that two doctors considered the applicant to be medically stable during the period that the applicant claims additional TTC. As a result, they had released the applicant to work. It is clear that when an injured worker is released from temporary total disability status that TTC should no longer be received. Booms v. Rapp Construction. 720 P.2d 1363, 1366 (Utah 1986). The applicant's argument that he was still within the diagnostic stages of treatment is contrary to the evidence. Six 066 ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE FOUR specialists have reviewed his case over time, and the applicant has had numerous diagnostic tests completed. None of the specialists with the possible exception of Dr. Hunter have concluded that surgery is warranted or possible. Dr. Holbrook, for example, concluded that no further examinations or diagnostic tests were warranted. This statement shows that the diagnostic period was complete. This case is complicated by the applicant's pre-existing medical problems, and by his limitation on medical choices forced upon him by AIDS. In addition, the applicant suffered two subsequent nonindustrial accidents which can be considered to be intervening and causally contributing events to the applicant's continuing back problems. In connection with the permanent partial impairment rating, the applicant argues that he should be given a higher rating since Dr. Sanders indicated that a 15 percent rating was appropriate since the applicant could not work. The applicant also cited Dr. Capel as support for this contention that the rating previously determined at five percent was too low. We note that the applicant was paid for his permanent partial impairment compensation. We agree with the ALJ that a five percent impairment is reasonable for an unoperated disc problem based upon the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. Table 53 (3d ed. rev. 1990) published by the American Medical Association. The bald statement by Dr. Sanders, in connection with his assertion that a 15 percent rating was appropriate, was supported by absolutely no medical analysis or logic. We need some justification, and in the absence of such, we cannot speculate. In the case of Dr. Capel, there is no statement by him as to any appropriate rating, other than a statement that the adjustor had decided upon a five percent rating. We therefore conclude that the evidence does not support the applicant in this regard. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the ALJ's findings, conclusions of law, and order were based upon substantial evidence in light of the entire record, and the legal conclusions were correct. The applicant has failed to prove his case. ORDER: IT IS ORDERED that the order of the administrative law judge dated June 29, 1992 is affirmed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any appeal shall be to the Utah 067 ASHCROFT ORDER PAGE FIVE Court of Appeals within 30 days of the date hereof, pursuant to Utah Code Annotated, Sections 35-1-82.53(2), 35-1-86, and 63-46b-16.

REVIEW OF FILE: The employer's first report of injury dated 9-27-89 indicates that this 40 year old truck driver was injured 9-25-89 unload-ing freight when he twisted his back. He last worked the following day and consulted Dr. M. K. McGreg-or September 28, 1989 with acute low back pain and profound muscle spasm in all directions and pain radiating down to the midposterior thigh. It notes \"injury to lower back while unload-ing a trailer\". 10-20-89 He was seen by Donald G. Bliss, M.D. who completed a comprehensive evaluation. MHe was lifting boxes while unloading a truck on 9-25-89 when he had a sudden severe pain in his back. The pain was like a \"ripping sensation\" and he had a hot burning sensation going up into his neck\". The pain was so severe he went to the emergency room. He has gradually improved with treatment but suddenly worse six days ago radiating into the left and then the right leg. He has had some intermittent minor low back pain on occasion with work in the past. On examination he found a slight list to the left. Some difficulty arising from the bent position and SLR 45 degrees. Reflexes, sensation and motor power normal but not tested in detail. X-rays felt to be normal. CT scan 10-17-89 shows a symmetrical central bulge at the L-3-4 disc with some compromise of the spinal canal but no root impingement. He recommended conservative treatment but noted Page two Re : Denis B. Ashcroft and continued under the care of Dr. Bliss with bilateral leg pain severely aggravated my myelogram. He had mild persistent pares-thesia in his toes. Myelogram and CT show significant disc bulg-ing at three levels but the spinal canal is fairly capacius with-out specific nerve root involvement. 2-1-90 He was evaluated by Dr. Gerald Moress. His back pain is al-most gone and he only notices it now when bends over or does some lifting. Beginning in October he started having impotence. He has now noticed some tingling in the upper extremities. He found no evidence of spinal stenosis and sensory findings in upper and lower extremities. He believed the pathology was within the cer-vical cord, either a hard disc or some demyelating disease and recommended complete myelography and CSF studies. 26 February 1990 MRI of the cervical spine with the following im-pression: 1. Multilevel cervical spine disease (narrowing including for-aminal narrowing and prominence of the facet joints. 2. Small herniated discs at C-4-5 and C-6-7 levels. 3. Mild concentric posterior bulge at C-5-6 level. 4. Mild to moderate narrowing at the intervertebral foramina at multiple levels as described. 2-27-90 Dr. Bliss recommended review with Dr. Moress. Patient clearly interprets all of his problems as stemming from his recent accident although multiple level disc disease indicates that he has had pre-existing problems and in addition, back pain is not his major complaint at this time. March 22, 1990 he was examined by Neal C. Capel, M.D. who per-formed a complete study. He has burning discomfort from D-7 - L-2, midline in both right and left paravertebral and ache in posterior thighs to the knees and calves with numbness. He further described his symptoms and x-rays. His diagnosis was acute low back strain and sprain with dysesthesiasbut no definite root signs with multi-ple segment disc protrusions most prominently 5-S-l with degener-ative disc segments. Psychosocial changes are quite prominent in the clinical context. He has not moved toward employability in his mind at all and has a passive approach. Most of the changes pre-existed the accident date. He should have a vigorous condit-ioning program followed by a rating of 5% impairment of the whole person. He is not a candidate for surgical intervention and fur-ther treatment measures or evaluation measures would probably best be applied to psychodynamic study and psychiatric consultation as he believes these factors are impacting his disability. He subsequently was on an exercise program and taking architect-viral drafting at Dixie College. He continued with moderate sympt-,^ 4-v* .^ .^i^ 4-„,. ^ ^^^+.4^^ ar,^ si-ress buildup. He went to Arizona C G L ^ C Ulij.ww Re: Denis B. Ashcroft and worked in his father's grocery store. His back did fairly well, but his legs got tired as he was on his feet all day on concrete. He is back in school again now. 11-13 He had the flu in the last 2 to 3 weeks and has not been carrying out his proper rehabilitation program. 11-29-90 New episode. On Sunday last, November 25th the patient picked firewood with sudden onset of low back pain more on the right. His diagnosis was facet syndrome and low back strain. He worked in his parent's grocery store about a month at Christ-mas time, has difficulty straightening up, has had psychological counseling and was again noted to have normal objective examinat-ion with subjective complaints. He recommended he continue his exercise program. By 3-15-91 he was getting along reasonably well until March 14th when he bent down to clean manure from his dog and sudden pain in the low back and trouble standing up. Bed rest was recommended. 9-26-91 He was in requesting that Dr. Capel relate the lifting of firewood episode November 25th to the accident of 9-25-89. He has been seeing other doctors for MRl and surgical considerat-ion. \"I have, of course, made that decision long ago\". MRI 4 October 1991 with the following impression: 1. Multiple degenerative disc disease with Grade II central bulge L-2-3, Grade I-XI central bulge L-3-4 and L-4-5, and Grade I central and slightly to the right central bulge L-4-S-1. 2. Borderline to moderate central spinal stenosis L-2-3. 3. Mild facet arthritis multiple levels with mild left foraminal stenosis L-5-S-1. Willard S* Hunter, M.D., Phoeniz, Arizona reported October 14, 1991 an absence of his right ankle reflex not previously noted, limitat-ion of straight leg raising at 30 degrees on the right and 50 de-grees on the left, decreased sensation outer aspect of the right foot and rather severe cervical disc disease which cannot be treat-ed except by an open operative intervention. Because of the recent change he recommended Chymofast test. I think he now has a herniat-ed disc at L-5-S-1. I advised that he could be injected. Dr. Hunter later noted that the decision regarding surgical inter-vention is affected by his HIV status. Also, would mean more caution for hospital personnel. May 8, 1991 office consultation by D. R. McNaught is out of chrono-logical order here. He again performed a complete evaluation. He is tired of living with the complaints and being unable to sleep at night although severe pain does not appear to be his major pro-blem. The left calf is 1 cm smaller than the right. There is tend-Page four Re: Denis B. Ashcroft erness. Reflexes normal. Slight weakness dorsiflecion both great toes. Reduced sensation bilaterally L-5 and in the calf and lat-eral border of feet which is quite numb, extending into the fifth toes of both feet. He reviewed the x-rays. He felt he did not have severe sciatica but ongoing complaints presumably due to at least significant bulging of lumbar discs primarily L-4,5 and per-haps some at the L-S level. It is doubtful he is a surgical cand-idate but does not want to go on living with his present complaints. He suggested possible epidural steroid injections if a new MRI is normal. He also suggested the possibility of Chymopapain injection. August 9, 1991 he was seen in consultation by John M. Sanders, M.D. who noted at the beginning his history seems to be fairly straight forward dating back to 1989 when he was unloading a truck and fur-ther reviewed the history. Nothing has given him any sustained re-lief. He has nothing to gain financially from having a surgical procedure done. I would have given the patient a 15% disability rating on the basis of his inability to return to his usual work. I think he got a 5% disability rating. (This clearly demonstrates a wide spread problem - the lack of understanding of rating of per-manent physical impairment in industrial cases.) He performed straight leg raising reasonably well. Reflexes were normal. Some sensory difference on alternate sides with difficulty knowing how to evaluate that. No atrophy. Motor power apparently normal. He reviewed his films and does not see a surgical lesion. In the lumbar region he has considerable fullness of the disc at L-3-4, 4-5 and L-5-S-1 but the nerve outlets seem to be satisfact-ory. He was still concerned they may be missing some neurological problem and he may see another neurologist or return to Dr. Moress. He did note a possibility of Chymopapain injection and/or aspirat-ion of the disc spaces because he doesn't have a focal lump of disc that would be missed by those procedures. \"Those are procedures that I have not been pleased with as I have seem them from this point in time but some people have done them and in their hands have reported good results so I' 11 leave that evaluation to you and someone else who sees him that might do those procedures) October 23, 1991 Dr. Sanders further reported that MRI didn't really show what he considered to be a specific surgical lesion though there are clearly some problems at multiple levels. None of them seem significant to warrant surgical intervention at the present time. SPECIAL STUDIES: 9-28-89 X-rays of the lumbar spine were interpreted by Dr. McGregor as normal. 10-17-89 CT lumbar spine Dixie Medical Center disc bulging at three levels with some decrease in AP diameter at L-3-4.

Ashcroft of the thecal sac or nerve roots. There does appear to be a degen-erative disc with vacuum phenomena at L-5-S-1. The above findings are somewhat equivocal. 12-19-89 Lumbar myelogram with CT scan Dixie Medical Center. Bulg-ing discs at multiple levels with slight nerve root asymmetry at L-5-S-1 on the myelogram. With CT there was noted to be bulging at L-2-3. At L-3-4 there was mild impression of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but no focal protrusion to suggest herniation and no encroachment of nerve roots. At L-4-5 there was disc degen-eration vacuum phenomenon with no impingement. At L-5-S-1 there is disc space narrowing and degeneration and vacuum phenomenon. With the bulging there is slight asymmetry to the right which en-croaches on the right first sacral root slightly. This should be correlated with clinical symptoms but is suggestive of focal hern-iation at L-5-S-1 and could account for a right S-l radiculopathy. 2-26-90 MRI of the cervical spine performed at Utah Valley Hospital showed significant findings but does not require further considerat-ion at this time. 5-7-91 Lumbar spine CT Valley View Medical Center showed degenerat-ive disc disease at L-5-S-1 with narrowing the disc space and gas in the disc. The posterior disc margin has a smooth, mild poster-ior bulge, without herniation. Posterior disc bulging is demonstrated at L-3-4 and 4-5 but this appears to be on a degenerative basis without actual herniation. 10-2-91 X-rays lumbar spine Utah Valley Hospital demonstrate mild changes at L-4-5 and L-5-S-1. 10-4-91 MRI lumbar spine Cottonwood Hospital shows multi-level disc disease with bulging at the four lower levels. L-2-3 disc is desiccated with central bulging, flattening of the thecal sac and moderate spinal stenosis. L-3-4 focal central bulging with desiccated disc and minimal flat-tening of the thecal sac. L-4-5 disc is desiccated with focal central bulging. L-5-S-1 disc is desiccated with focal grade I - II central disc bulge slightly asymmetric to the right without extruded fragment or nerve root comprssion. There is no significant compression of the thecal sac. Minimal foraminal stenosis is present slightly greater on the left but no definite nerve root impingement is apparent. Degenerative changes were noted at all levels. 22 January 1992 lumbar discography assessment: r Q ^ c 0J.A Re: Denis B. Ashcroft Internally disrupted discs with sizable posterior protrusions from L-3 through S-l. The L-4-5 and L-5-S-1 levels appear to be the most significant. Never the less, typical reproduct-ion of the patientfs usual leg pain was not achieved. The patient did have his typical back pain which, by his own admission, is his least pain with injection at the L-4-5 level. DISCUSSION: There are those individuals who seek interminably more and more medical care as a solution to their problem. Medicine cannot solve all problems. Doctors cannot solve all problems. Surgery cannot solve all problems. This man does have significant multi-level cervical disc disease that is not related to his industrial injury and is not being con-sidered for any possible surgical treatment and appears to be a relatively minor portion of his symptom complex. Major problem hinges on the lumbar area. In your letter you suggest that the L-3-4 disc was the one that was being considered for treatment but ray review of this case indic-ates that the L-5-S-1 is the disc being singled out for treatment. There is no question but what multiple studies have been performed which in general all agree with each other. There have been no specific new revelations by any succeeding tests and these have been done because the patient has seen more and more doctors who felt more and more tests should be required. If one continues to see an unending string of doctors almost an unending therapy pro-gram will be prescribed and tests will be repeated over and over to ensure that something has not been missed. Once a person has seen two competent physicians it is almost never that any significant pathology that is different is going to be uncovered by a third. Thus repeated medical evaluations becomes a goal in itself in a desperate search by the patient who is unable to say enough is enough and to accept the diagnosis, the prognosis, and more par-ticularly accept his role as the patient. It appears that this person has been unwilling to do this but he is looking for some doctor to solve his problem. One hears of these rare and magical cases that are reported and continue to give all persons hope, but this is not realistic. This man has had every benefit of medical care and evaluation having been seen and evaluated and in some instances treated by five specialists prior to seeing Dr. Hunter. Dr. Hunter has extensive experience in Chymopapain injections and was, in fact, personally one of the very early persons to receive this treatment and was gratified by the results. In general, after extensive publicity the procedure has receded to where it is now seldom performed. Newer procedures such as percutaneous discectomy and suction discectomy have come along and they are be-ing tried as well. Anything that is new is good and everybody J T C L ^ ^ »3*5V*-.** Re: Denis B. Ashcroft wants the new thing whether it is proven to be as good or better than the old thing or not. Dr. Hunter is the only one of these five previous physicians who has really had any kind of feeling that surgical treatment could actually be recommended though Dr. McNaught and Dr. Sanders did mention it as a possible consideration. I suspect that this was primarily prompted by the encouragement or insistence of the pat-ienlfc. I may not be properly characterizing their opinion regard-ing Chemonucleolysis in this patient. Thus, I don't know if his referral to Dr. Hunter was really initiated by his attending phy-sician's here or was more or less requested or demanded by the pat-ient. Dr. Hunter is the only one who found any reflex changes and he is the only one who has felt that there was any real surgical conclusion to be drawn from the sensory pattern that this man demonstrates. If one goes all the way back to the time he was under the care of Dr. Capel and reads the last few notes of Dr. Capel it still very clearly states this man's status and I don't believe that all of the other evaluations and studies have chang-ed that. It is difficult to delineate the level of his pain but I would surmise that his fears regarding his physical condition have over-whelmed him. That he may not be dealing well with his HIV status and that he may well be transferring his health care concerns to something that he can specifically identify in his back and hope that some magic is going to significantly improve his condition. I am not sure how strongly Dr. Hunter feels about this surgical condition and how strongly he is urging this because he states \"I think he now has a herniated disc at L-5-S-1 and advised that he could be injected\" (emphasis added). This gives this reviewer more of an impression that Dr. Hunter would be acquiescing in the wishes and desires of the patient more than he is actively pro-moting this procedure himself. There are two additional factors in this case. 11-25-90 the pat-ient had a significant new episode. Prior to this it would appear that he was getting along quite well and was definitely substanti-ally worse following that episode. 3-15-91 It was noted he was getting along reasonably well until March 14, 1991 when he bent down to clean manure and had sudden pain in the low back and trouble standing up representing another further significant episode though not really associated with undue stress or strain. Thus, there are two significant episodes thathave continued to contribute to his problem subsequent to the industrial accident though there was not shown to be any substant-ial change in the specific diagnostic studies from the time before until the time after these two episodes. One should additionally note the lack of specificity of the disco-page eigne Re: Denis B. Ashcroft gram as to the delineating the level of the problem to which treatment should be directed. ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: 1. No further additional, medical treatment is reasonable and nec-essary for Mr. Ashcroft as a direct result of the industrial event of September 25, 19 89. 2. The proposed Chymopapain injection is not a reasonably necess-ary medical treatment in light of Mr. Ashcroft1s overall medical condition and more specifically in regards to these two specific factors: a. There is diffuse degenerative disc disease involving four levels of his lumbar spine. b. Even the worst reading relative to the L-5-S-1 disc interprets this as a rather benign protrusion or disc herniated that could not reasonably be expected to compress the nerve roots on both sides. This would not explain apparent weak dorsiflexion of the toes and sub-jective paresthesia and would not appear to be sufficient to recommend or urge surgery. Dr. Hunter has based his conclusions regarding surgery a good deal on the absence of his right ankle reflex which appears to be a change since his last prior examination by Dr. Sanders associat-ed with limitation of straight leg raising and decrease sensation on the outer aspect of the right foot. In view of the extensive studies and evaluations that this patient has had it does not appear that more medical examinations or more diagnostic studies will assist in the delineation or management of his problem. If one felt compelled to obtain additional evaluat-ion to help clear the air then perhaps a re-evaluation by Dr. Mor-ess who saw him some time ago and could review all of his subsequent radiographic studies if he felt it would be helpful in additon to the reports. 3. If Mr. Ashcroft undergoes the Chymopapain injection in any event this is generally considered to be a rather benign operative procedure with a low complication rate and a rather low morbidity rate but sometimes temporary total disability will continue beyond three months and sometimes associated with rather severe muscle spasm and extended aggravation of symptoms. Frequently there is no improvement. The additional problem is that a multi-level disc disease and the inability to be certain that one is attacking an area that is the primary cause of his pain in view of all of the studies including the discography. Even \"good\" relief at this level may constitute very little improvement in the total picture. Under no circumstances would a fusion be considered in view of his other medical conditions as well as the extensive nature of his lumbar spine disease. Page nine Re: Denis B. Ashcroft There is increased surgical risks with Aids but a simple Chymopapain injection would appear to carry minimal additional risks. 4. Most of those who have examined this applicant have felt that his neurological symptoms are primarily not related to a protruded or herniated intervertebral- disc and thus not specifically related to the alleged injury of 9-25-89.

Wilcox and Jason J. Moses Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory Cleveland, Ohio Washington March 1947 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930081982 2020-06-17T21:17:05+00:00ZNATIONAL ADTISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS EXPmIMENTAIL AND THEOlXlXCICAL STUDIES OF SURGING IN CONTIN[ JOUS -FLOW COMPRESS0;RS By Robert 0. ~ullock, Ward W. Wilcox and Jason J. Moses Experiments have been conducted to determine the conditions that cause surging in co~;tr)ressors and to determine the effect of various installations and opera%ing conditions on the character of the velocity and pressure variations occurring dur1ing surging. These investigations were m d e  on three compressor units and the variation of static, total, or velocity pressure with time was recorded. In addition to the e~2erimental studies, a siaplified analysis was made to determine how instability of flow may occur in a compressor. An examination, based on this analysis, %ras made of several possible . methods of inhibiting the occurrence af surging. Surging was found to be a periodic variation of pressures and velocities that may occur when the slope of the compressor characer- istic cnrve is positive. A tra~sition region of finite extent and characterized by erratic pulsations of small ~agnitude separated surging from stable operation. The freqxency of the pulsations was always the sama thrcughout the unit,; the wave form was frequently nonsinusoidal. The actual magnitude of the slope at which surging begins is determined by the iime required for the static gressure in the external pipes to adJust itself to a change in flow conditions in the conpressor passages. The ma~nitudc ar;d the frequency of the pressure 2ulsations, as well as the point on thc characteristic curve at which surging begins, depend on a comylex relation of the capacity and the resistance of each component of the total system. Because the occurrence and manifestaticn of unsta5le oparation is dependent on the d,vnamic ?roperties of the ccnplete air-flow system, attem~ts to utilizc one ~f the several methods for inliibitlng surge should be rnade only on ths actual installation with which thc\"com- pressor is to bs used. NACA TN Eo. 1213 INTRODUCTION I n  modern high-s~eed superchargers and' compressors a periodic pulsating flow known a s  surging terminates the operating range a t  low flow ra tes .  I n  order t o  obtain the desired f l e x i b i l i t y  of operation of an a i r c r a f t  power plant,  the range of the compressorj indicated by the r a t i o  of maximum volume flow t o  minimum volume flow, must be a s  large as  possible. The range of centrifugal compressors rapidly decreases as  the impeller t i p  speed is inc rea~ed .  The demand fo r  increased power-plant performance a t  high a l t i tudes ,  however, has placed increasing emphasis on the necessity f o r  high t3.p speeds. A s  a r e su l t ,  when a compressor is designed f o r  m a x i -  mum power, the cruising power may be l imited by the occurrence of surging. An extension of the surge-free range of operation of centrifugal compressors i s  therefore an important par t  of compressor research. References 1, 2 ,  and 3 have s tated tha t  surging i s  essent ial ly  the r e su l t  of a flow ins tab i l i ty ,  which occurs only when the slope of the character is t ic  curve (pressure r a t i o  against flow function) is posit ive.  The slope of the character is t ic  curve where surging begins, however, is not the same f o r  alL corn-pressors; i n  fac t ,  when a given compressor uni t  i s  tested i n  two ins ta l la t ions ,  the value of the flow function a t  whizch swging begins ( the surge point) is frequently different .  Although the slope of the character is t ic  curve influences the occurrence of surging, several unknown prop- e r t i e s  of the complete in s t a l l a t ion  apparently a l so  govern i t s  occurrence. I n  the t e s t s  reportea i n  reference 3, an attempt was made t o  influence the posit ion of the surge point by introducing a fluc- tuat ing flow a t  che compressor in l e t .  This forced periodicity of flow w a s  found t o  have a negligible e f fec t .  Observations of the character is t ics  of the pressure pulsations during surging (references 2 and 3) indicated tha t  the frequency and magnitude of the pulsations a re  somewhat affected by the volume of the compressor and the pipes of the system. I n  general, an increase i n  t h i s  vol~une apparently resulted i n  an increase i n  the amplitude of the pulsatians and a reduction i n  the frequency. I n  the present investigation, a special  recording instrument wap used t o  obtain an estimate of the magnitude and frequency of the pressure p~xlsaticns during surging. Experimental studies wers made of the t rans i t ion  f ~ o m  steady flow t o  surging and of the phase re la t ion  of s t a t i c ,  t o t a l ,  and velocity pressures during swging. 1L Other experiments were made t o  detemine how the frequency and the magnitu4e of the pulsations were affected by changes i n  the volme .of the compressor system and the t i p  speed of the impeller, Several of the records of the pressure pulsations a re  presented and discussed. A simplified analysis is presented t o  show how insta-  b i l i t y  of flow may be produced i n  a compressor and an examination based on t h i s  ana.lysis is  made of several possible methods of inhibi t ing the occurrence of surging. Part  of the experimental work was done on two t e s t  uni ts  a t  the NACA Langley Field' laboratory, More complete t e s t s  a 3 h e  Cleveland laboratory were made on a th i rd  t e s t  which was especially designed fo r  surge studies. Compressor Test Rigs Three separate t e s t  uni ts  were used fo r  the experimental inves- t igat ions.  Each unit  was s e t  up t o  conform t o  the standards and specifications recommended i n  reference 4. I n  each instance, the compressor uni t  was mounted d i rec t ly  on a speed increaser having a step-up r a t i o  of 15:l  and was driven by an a i r c ra f t  engine or a dynamome-her. The a i r  flow w a s  determined by measuring the pressure drop across a calibrated o r i f i ce  with an TJACA micromanometer. P i to t  tubes of 0.060-inch s t e e l  tubing were instal led a t  the  i n l e t  and the out le t  measuring stations; s t a t i c  or i f ices  of C,050-inch diameter were placed a short distance upstream of the p i to t  tubes. Throttles were placed i n  the i n l e t  and oc t le t  pipes t o  regulate the flow, Tests were f i r s t '  made on uni t  A, which consisted of a f u l l y  shrouded im2eller and a. vaned diffuser  mounted i n  a standard NACA variable-component t e s t  r i g  having a torus-shaped collector of 15-cubic-fo~t  c a p c i t y ,  (see reference 4. ) Unit B consisted of a mixed-flow impeller and a 20-inch-diameter vaneless diffuser ,  which were a l so  mounted i n  a variable-component t e s t  r ig .  The greatest  par t  of the work was done on t e s t  unit  C ( f i g ,  l ) ,  which was especially designed fo r  investigations of the cause and character of the surge pulsations. Because the volume enclosed i n  the collector may have had an ef fec t  on the r e su l t s  of previous investigations, t h i s  unit was designed t o  make.the t o t a l  volume of the compressor i t s e l f  as  small as  possible. A conventional impeller, which was modified by reducing both the diameter at the inlst and the height cf the blades at the tips, was used in this rig. The vaneless diffuser, which formed an integral unit with the scroll coll.ector, was designed to avoid the occurrence of separation in the diffus~r. Eie disturbances in the flow system at low volume flows were reduced by designiq the lip at the discharge of tlie collector to have a 0' angle of attack at a low volume flow. A schematic diagram of the rig in ~~hich t is unit was tested is shown in figure 2. Instantmeocs Pressure Recorder The pressure an6 velocity pv.lsations during surging were measured. on a stan3mrd X-AC-4 dlff erentiaL-pressuTe recorder. This instrument has been described in references 5 and 6 but, for \"ue convenience of the reader, SOMO of its principles are described again. The instrument with two cells installed is sho~~n i fig- ure 3. Two simultaneous -pressure recordings can be taken by using ~TTO cells with a single film unit. Because the pressure cell actu- ally measures differential pressures, the variations in static pressure, total pressure, or velocity ~reasure may be recorded. Static and total rressures are o~posed'by some lz~own pressure, usval-ly atmospheric, to oStain a drrsct trace of pressuse variation with time: The variatzon in velocity pressure is recorded by introducing static pressure on one side of the diaphragm and total pressure on the other; the instrument records the differential pressure and a t~ace of the velocity-pressure variation is thereby obta.ined. .ALsc, by recordinr; a differential pressure rather than an absolute pres- swe, a sensitive cell can be us=d for a large range of compressor operating condi tZons. I , When uscd with-test units A and B, thtt 'instrument com~rised two cells: one with a differential-pressure range from 0 to 5r) inches of water, the other with a range from 0 to 30 inches of water. Cells with progsure ranaes from 0 to 5 inches of water and 0 to 50 inches of water worc used for tests on uniB C. When the sensitive cell was uscd, the vibrations of the motor and the gear train that movod tha film past the light orifice were recorded along with the pressure var:ations, Although these vibrations combined with the pressure vihations to superimpose a low-frequency osciT- lation on the film record, tho accuracy ~f tbe frequency measure~on5s was not affected. A study of t he  cha r ac t e r i s t i c s  of t h e  pressure-recoyding system showed t h a t  t he  indicated mgni tudes  of t he  Dressure va r ia t ions  were not, al.togo?ther r e l i ab l e ,  being a f fec ted  b; the  s i z e ,  t h e  type, and t h e  length of t h e  pressure tubeti, I n  general,  however, t h e  nagni- tudes of t he  pressure va r ia t ions  indicated by the  t r a ce s  were roughly proport ional  t o  thoso ac tua l l y  occurring i~ the  system when t he  i n s t a l l a t i o n  remained unchar~ged f o r  t h e  e n t i r e  s e r i e s  of t e s t s .

The volune was  the re fore  varied 3y using each of 6 NACA TN No. 12 13 three inlet conditions in conguncticn with each of three ou21et throttle locat ions (fig . 2) ; thus nine different combinations af inlet and outlet conditions were tested. The three inlet conditions were: 1. Inlet throttle wide open (located 24 diameters upstream from the campressor inlet, station K) 2. Inlet throttle partly closed (station K) 3, Inlet pipes replaced by a nozzle at the compressor inlet (station L) The three outlet conditicns were: 1. Outlet throttle 51 ddameters downstream of compressor outlet (station A) , .  2. Outlet throttle 33 diameters downstream of comyressor outlet (station B) 3. Outlet throttle replaced by a 3-inch gate valve at compressor outlet (station D) All the tests to determine the effect of volume of the system on surg- , 4ng were made at an impeller tip speed of 960 feet per second. Tests were also made on test unit C to determine the effect of tip speed on the chas-acteristics of surging. For these tests complute compressor data and a number or\" velocity-pressure traces were talcen a< several tip speeds. In order to apply the results of the analysts of surging, the variation of the pressure drq across the throttles with mass flow had to be determined. The throttlc setting was maintained constant and the weight flow of air was varied over a w-ide range by varying the impeller speed. The weight flow of air and the pressl.re drops across the throttles were recorded. All tests were run at sea-level conditions with inlet-air tcmperstures from 6 8 O  to 100° F.

In general, this trend agrees with the observqtions of p.revious investigations; that ie, a large external-system volume reeults in a low-frequency, high-amplitude vibration; whereas a small volume results in a high-frequency, low- magnitude vibration. No .simple relation, however, could be found to express the fyeque;?cy as a function of the inlet and the outlet volumes, which indicates that factors other than the effective volme also control the surging characteristics. The pressure dro? across the throttle and the inertia of the air in motion aust be considered. The following table shows the effects 09 volume on frequency of surge pulsations for test unit C: i Inlet cu ft)l- - volume '- Frequency (c-ps) (CU ft)L \\.,; Effcjct of impeller tip speed on magnitude and frequency of ?res- --- sure pulsations during surging. - In the course of these investiga- -tions, additional tests were conducted on test unit C t6'detemine the effect of tip speed-on the magnitude and the frequency of the pressure pulsation. The records taken a% 960 and 1200 feet per second with the outlet throttle 30 diameters do-cmstrearb of the com~~essor outlet and the inlet throttle 24 diarrieters upstrean of the compressor inlet are presented in figure 12. Although the ampl?tx&e of the pulsations is approximately doubled, the frequency is changed very little by an increase in tip speed. Thfs result is representative of tests on other compressors. Instability of Flow in Compressors. Tht2 results of the preeent ar,d previous inyestigations (refsr- ences 1, 2, and 3) have shown that surging occurs only when the slope of the characteristic c7Jrve is positive and that the volume of air enclosed by the system has a definite effect on the frequency and the NAC A TN No. 12 13 11 magnitude of the pressure variations. In addition, the variations in pressure and velocity during surging need not have a sinusoidal variation with time. Tilese o'oservations indicate that surging is a self-induced vibration resulting from an inherent instability of the flow in some p&rt of the operating range. The slope of the characteristic curTe is a criterion of the stability of the flow. Inasmuch as the frequency and the ma~mitude of the pulsations are affected by the volue, this quantity aight also be expected to afi'ect the stability. Vibrations or\" this type seldom have purely sinusoidal qualities. The general method used to study the stability of a given motion is to assumc that a small deviation from %he steady form of motion is produced and then to investigate whether the ensuing reactions tend. to oppose the deviation or accentuate it (references 7, pp, 32-35, and 8). The reactions are brought about by the inertia, elastic, and frictional forces induced by the deviation, The inertia forces are a function of the rate of change of the velocity of the motion; the elastic forces are a function of the magnitude of the deviation itself; the frictional forces are a function of the velocity of the ~otion. Because stability of the motion is the issue rather than the motion itself, only the linear terms are considered. In a compressor operating at constant speed, the inertia forces are due to changing the velocity of the C,otal Ease of alr in motion. Elastic forces result from the elastic prozerty of air. Friclkional forces are (1) the true frictional force caused by skin friction and throttling, and (2) the force that causes the pressure rise in the compressor, which is, in a sense, a neg&tive friction force. These forces are interrelated in a co~plex manner and efforts to develog an analytical expression to describe the influence of these forces for a general compressor systera indicated that the equations become greatly involved. By the use of sim~lifying assumptions, however, an approximation was developed (see the appendix) to detarmine the relative inflcence of the various forces affecting the stability of the operation of a compressor. The derivation is somewhat limited because it is based on a simyle systeol of an inlet pipe, an inlet throttle, and-a compressor unit, Further limitations are imposed on the devclop&nt because of the following~simplifyfng assumptione: (1) The difference between the static prassure and the total pressure is small. ' (2 ) The pressure and the mass df stribution in the inlet pipe vary linearly zlong the pipe length, 12 NACA TN No. 1213 t. (3) The volume of the compressor is negligible. Two simu'ltaneous differential equations can be set up from these as,sumptior_s,to btain the expr, -ssions and 6Mc = K2 est sin ( w  + d2) where 6Mi small changb of mass flow rate through inlet throttle 6Mc small change of mass flow rate through compressor Klz K2 constants determining relative amplitude of vibratory motion fl lr  constants governing phase relation of vibratory motion s stability term t t ime . . uj frequency term Only the exponefit s need be examined to investigate the sta- bility of the system. When scO, the system is in stable equilib- rium; whcn sZO, instability results. The frequency term u, is of no interest for this discussion becauee the method of small deviations does not apply after instability occurs and the amplitude of the motion becomes large.

When y algebraically exceeds x, the sign of s is positive and instability results, A physical picture of the relation between the slopes of the throttle and the compressor characteristic curves and the stability of operation can be obtained by visualizing the effect of small dis- turbances in the flow. The throttle characteristic curves represent the variation of the total restrlctions to flow in the e-xternal piping with mass flow. When the disturbance causes the pressure rise through the compressor to exceed the pressure drop through the exker~al pi~ing, the mass flow will increase; coxversely, when the throttle pressure drop is greater than the pressure rise of the compressor, the mass flow will decrease. Figure 13(a) ~~hows the variation of the pressure drop in the external piping and the pres- sure rise across the compressor with mass flow for a b~othetical unit.

Although the calculated values of y are much less than the actual values, they are both much saaller than x. Good correlation between the calculated an& the actual values was not expected because the conditions of the equation and those of opera- tion were very different . In the development of equation (I), the assumptions were made tha-t only the flow upstream of the imyeller inlet was restricted and that the volume of the compressor was negligible; whereas, in the actual case, there were flow restrictions at both the inlet and the outlet of the compressor and the volume enclosed by the compressor was appreciable, Although equation (1) cannot be used as an absolute criterion of surging, it is useful in obtaining a physical picture of the phenomenon, Compressibility effects can be pictured with the aid of fig- ure 13(a), If the point of operation of the compressor momentarily drops to point A from point E, the operating point of the throttles would Dove to point A' if the air were incom~ressible, Before the pressure in the pipe can drop to the pressure required for this condition, the mass of air contained by the pipe must decrease; that is, far a definite interval of time the m s s  flow of air leaving the pipe must be greater than that entering it. Thus a finite time is required for the static pressure to adjust itself completely to the change in flow conditions. ('This time lag should not be ccnfused with the tins lapse due to the finite velocity of sound.)

If t h e  value of y is t o  be posit ive,  t h e  pressure losses  i n  t h e  com- pressor  must increase as the  flow decreases (except f o r  c e r t a in  imr~e l le r s  wlth forward-sweyt blades) ,  which would be indicative of t h e  development of a breakdown i n - t h e  flow at some point in t h e  system.

The value of vc31ume f law at which a large-scale breakdown of fl-ow occurs may be considered as t h e  ulti.mate l m e r  l i m i t  at which surge - f ree  operation may bo obtained with any given impeller.

A s  t h r o t t l i n g  a t  t he  i n l e t  is increased, t h e  incoming a i r  is given a ro t a t i on  i n  t h e  d i rec t ion  of impeller t r a v e l  and t he  g r ea t e r  t h e  mount of p re ro ta t ion  t h e  i e s s  w i l l  be t h e  pressure r i s e  crf'thc comnrcssor.

A dovice t h a t  opcratcs on t he  principle of delaying tho response of t hc  compressor was dev~lopcd  by t h e  Gcncral E ldc t r i c  Company f o r  18 NACA TN No. 12 13 inhibiting surging. A sizable chamber'is connected to the flow .passage at the leading edges of the diffuser blades by means of very mall orifices. If the positive slope of the compressor cume is due to a momentary breakdom in the flow at the diffuser tips, , the resulting drog of pressure in this region will cause the chamker to discharge air into the passages and thus delay the rates of' cfiacge of the dscrease in the over-all pressure ratio. The effeztiveress of operation of an arrangement of this type will depend on the purpose for which the compressor is to be ussd. A typical compessor installation for a modern aircraft engine has a large number of components, each of which contributes its own particular resistance, capacity, and inertia effects to the totals for the system. The surge point,obuervsd during bench tests usually corresponds. fairly closely to that found for the actual installation. A device for inhibiting surge by changing the response of the unit for any one system, however, cannot be expected to function properly when used in another system where the resistance, the capacity, and the inertia effects are greatly different. For this reason, investi- gatlons made to increase the surge-free range must be made on the complote installation with which %he compressor unit is to be used. SUIME;RY OF RESULTS The results of experiments with thee compressor test rigs and analytical studies of surge show that : 1. As a rule, a transition region characterized by erratic pulsations of small.mgnitude existed between the region of stable operation and the point where definite surging begins. 2. The fact that the frequency of the pulsations thi-oughout the ' system was uniform indicated that the system surged as a unit. 3. Although the pressure pulsations were periodic, their varia- tions with respect to time were frequently nonsinusoidal. 4. Dccreasing the volumetric capacity of the external pipes increased the frequency and decreased the uplitude of the pressure pulsations. Apparently the frequency and the o::~rpiitude both de~ended on a cbillplex relation of the capacity and the resistance of each coxponent of the system. CONCLUSIONS From the foregoing results, the following conclusions have been dram: 1. Surging is the mnLfestation of a instzbility of flow In a compressor, If this condition is to exist, the slope oZ the compressor chnmcteristic curve must be positive and a time interval must exist between 3 change in flcw conditions in the compressor passages and the static-pressure adjustment in the external p-ipss. 2. The surge-free range of any compressor may possibly be extended or the &?gnitude of the surging pulsations be reduced by either reducing the magnitude of the positive slope of the character- istic curvg or by changing the volumetric capacity of the compressor componellts. All such investigations should be mde on the actual inatallation with 'iili$ch the compressor is to be used.

When a small deviation or displacement from the state of equilibrium of a system is assumed, certain vibrations will occur that may be analytically studied. If these vibrations have a tendency to die out, equilib- rium is maintained; otherwise, it is destroyed. In addition to the compressor itself, a typical compressor installation contains one or more throttling units and several lengths of piping. A rigorous analysis of the stability of such a system requires a knowledge of the distribution of the pressure, the temperature, and the velocity at each point in the system. At present, a thorqugh study of the stability of any specific system is not so feasible as formulating a relation between the various factors affdcting stability and tbus obtaining information on the fundamental causes of unstable operation. For simplicity, a compressor system (fig. 15) consisting of an inlet throttle, an inlet pipe, and the compressor unit will be assumed. Air enters the throttle directly from the atmosphere and is directly discharged from the compressor into the atmosphere. NACA TN No. 1213 Rt equiiibriurn, ;he drop in static pressure Apio across the inlet throttle is equal to the rise in static pressure bpco acrosd the compessor (from the assmption that the difference between static and total pressure is smail). ' If A is assumed to be e function of the mass flow Mi through the throttle, the occurrence of- a disturbance that causes a small change EMi In the main flow will cause the pressure drsp across the;throttle to become and This disturbance may or may not be equal to that through the throttle. At any instant, the static pressure p2 i;mnediately.downstream of the throttle must be equal to the difference between the pressure p1 of the atmosphere and Ape. Similarly, the pressure pg imme- diately upstream of the compressor must equal the difference between pl. and Apt. These requirements provide the relation When the values of Api and Ap, determined in equations (2) and (3) are substf tuted, The displacements assumed for studying the stability of the system are so smll {hat x and y may be treated as constants. The existence of this difference in pressure at the two extrem- ities of the inlet pipe will change the momentum of the mass of air enclosed by the inlet pipe. If friction forces are neglected, the rate of change of momentum will equal the product of the pressure difference by the area of the pipe. Thus NACA TX N c  . 12 13 This exprsssion m y  also be writ+uen Because the dis t r ib~xt ion of the changes i n  mass flow i n  the i n l e t  pipe i s  unkno~in, t h s  mass flow r a t e  is  assumed t o  vary l inear ly  along the pipe length.

After the sim~xltaneous differential equations (4) and (6) are solved the resulting sxpressisns for 6% and 6Mc are FMi = Q est sin. (d~ + 6Mc = K2 eSt sin ( & I  c 82)  where Kl and fll are arbitrary constants that determine the values of K2 ($2. When expressions of this type are used to represent the dynamic characteristics of a system, the significance of the terms is as follows : (a) The constants K1 and K2 determine the relative amplitude of the vibratory motion. (b) The term est indicates the variation of the amplitude of vibration'with time. E s is positive, the vibrations increase with time and unstable operation geaults; a negative value of s indicates stable operation. ( c )  The term sin (at + fil) designates the frequency and phase reiations. The frequency depends upon wt and PI1 governs the phase relation. NACA TN No. 12 13 2 5 inamycli as the main interest of tliis discussion is centered on tbc question or\" stability, t41o tcrm est wrll be considered more fully. The expressions for s and o are and 'As previously stated, when the-sign of s is negative, the vibrations are diminished as time passes and:%he operation is stable. On the other hand, a positive value of s results in unstable oper- ation. The determination of stability is therefore reduced to the detennination of the sign of tho varia3les in equation (1). All of the terns in this oxpression are ~ositfve with the exception of Fne slope y or' the conpre~sor character'istic curve, which may be either pot3itive or negative.

"Optimal sub-wavelength structures (SWS) with parabolic hole on glass substrate are designed using effective medium theory (EMT), which will reduce the reflectance over wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm and 0 degrees to 80 degrees angle of incidence. The performance of SWS integrated glass is verified by genetic algorithm. The optimized SWS with the cross-sectional profile of parabolic hole have parameters with similar to 120 nm diameter and 300 nm height. The average reflectance over wavelength range from 300 to 1200 mm and 0 degrees to 80 degrees angle of incidence could be reduced to only 0.5% by applying the optimized SWS onto glass.

PRC staff work with community members in Cuba on various projects including the Cuba Farmers’ Market and Community Garden which help to increase access to fresh, healthy foods. They also work on collabora-tive efforts with the Step Into Cuba Alliance to make the community more walkable and pedestrian-friendly. HEALTHY EATING-CUBA FARMERS MARKET AND COMMUNITY GARDEN In the summer of 2011, the Cuba Farmers’ Market began its second Update on the UNM Prevention Research Center’s Healthy Kids, Healthy Cuba Project By Shari Smoker, BA and Susan DeFrancesco, JD, MPH Healthy Kids Healthy Cuba year of operation offering the resi-dents of Cuba and the surrounding areas a place to buy and sell lo-cally grown fresh foods, learn about healthy eating, and socialize with neighbors.

Young people from the Cuba com-munity are also involved in the Cuba Community Garden which contin-ues to expand with new garden beds built, additional plantings and more members. Young people involved in these projects are increasing their skills to successfully grow healthy food and recognizing their ability to contribute to community efforts that improve health. MAKING FAIR FOODS HEALTHIER Another Healthy Kids, Healthy Cubaproject launched this summer at the Sandoval County Fair, in collabora-tion with the Sandoval County Fair Board, provided support to participating food vendors to buy, prepare, and sell health-ier foods. Some of the food and drinks served were new, while some were healthier twists on classic Fair favor-ites, such as hamburgers on whole wheat buns instead of white buns served with baked chips, salad or a fruit cup as a side, rather than french fries. A survey showed that fairgoers en-joyed having more food op-tions at the fair and thought the healthier choices were tasty ones! SAFE AND ACTIVE LIVING Through a collaborative effort of the Village of Cuba, the Step Into Cuba Alliance, the PRC, and the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT) work began in Septem-ber on a new sidewalk con-struction project in Cuba to make the Village more walkable and safe along U.S. 550. Sidewalks and buffer areas that separate the pedestrian from traffc along U.S. 550 are being con-structed from the intersection of NM 197 northeast to Cordova Avenue. A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) report prepared by PRC staff, with input from the community, and that describes the positive health effects of improved pedestrian safety along U.S. 550 for Cuba residents, was included in the NMDOT’s Environmental As-sessment for the sidewalk project. CONGRESSMAN BEN RAY LUJAN VISITS CUBA On Au-gust 22nd, Congressman Ben Ray Lujan visited Cuba. He toured the Nacimiento Community Foundation and Public Health offces, the Cuba Food Pantry, and then walked to the Cuba Community Garden. At the garden, the Congressman was met by local community members, garden members, and local youth who had written to the Congressman asking him to visit. The Congressman spoke to the children about the importance of growing and eating healthy foods, and congratulated them on their involvement in community projects. He praised the Cuba Community Garden for a job well done in getting the community to-gether in such a great place to grow! The Congressman also experienced frsthand the chal-lenges of a pedestrian attempting to cross U.S. 550 and learned about the efforts to make Cuba’s Main Street more pedes-trian friendly. He also hiked part of the new Fisher Trail. The Congressman was impressed with and supportive of all of the efforts the Village and Fair vendors Marla Rafael and daughter Alyssa participated in the healthy vending project at the Fair The Connection - WINTER - 2011                                                                                     UNM Prevention Research CenterVisit us at http://hsc.unm.edu/som/prc/        3 Photo credits: Shari Smoker U.S. 550 sidewalk construction in Cuba, New Mexico in late summer 2011 community residents and the UNM Prevention Research Center put forth to improve the health and safety of community residents. Congressman Lujan’s visit was a follow-up to a trip made to Washington D.C. by Susan DeFrancesco, HKHC Project Director, and Dr. Richard Kozoll, Step Into Cuba Volunteer Coordina-tor, in March 2011 sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Healthy Kids Healthy Communi-ties project. During their trip, Ms. DeFrancesco and Dr. Kozoll visited all of the New Mexico Congressmen’s offces and talked about the efforts of Step Into Cuba and Healthy Kids Healthy Cuba to encourage healthy lifestyles among families in Cuba. They had invited Congressman Lujan to visit Cuba to learn more about all the exciting healthy eating and active living projects! Right Photo: Congressman Lujan visits the Cuba Community Garden.

Data were collected to examine the implementation of evidence-based strategies to increase physical activity at the community level. The strategies are detailed in the CDC’s Community Guide for Promoting Physi-cal Activity (http://www.thecommunityguide.org/pa/ index.html) and include access to places for physical activity, an individual health-behavior change pro-gram, social support, a community-wide campaign, and point-of-decision prompts. Over 300 people were invited to take the survey; among those eligible 58% completed the survey. The interviewees that participated were interested in learn-ing more about the study, and were eager to provide input about physical activity in Cuba and in their lives. After the data are analyzed, the results will be provided to the community, to other profes-sionals, and to other communities interested in the project. We hope to see an increase in the amount of walking and other physical activity in the Village over time, and also on the various trails that have been established within and around the community. The PRC is excited to be working collaboratively with the community-based Step into Cuba program on this project and is looking forward to our continued partnership. We appreciate all of the organizations and businesses who allowed VIVA staff to set up on their property to conduct the surveys including the Village of Cuba, Mickey’s Saveway, Subway, El Bruno’s, and the Nacimiento Community Foundation.

STAND UP FOR YOUR HEALTH! By Sarah Sanders, MA and Mary Hanrahan, BFA These days “standing desks” are becoming a popular trend in places like the Pentagon and Silicon Valley, but the shift to standing at work is historically much older than you might think. The frst reports of standing desks were in 19th century industrial and state legislature journals. Standing desks were popular at the time in offces, banks, architectural frms, and newspapers and instead of indi-vidual desks there were communal areas where employees would stand or lean with stools over banks of large communal tables. In 1889, Dr. Ludwig Wilhelm Johannes Kotelmann describes in his book, ‘School Hygiene,’ the importance ofstanding desks: “too much sitting is liable to injure the abdomi-nal organs and the circulation,” he states. The most popular useof standing desks by famous people throughout history were:Thomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill andEarnest Hemingway to name a few. What is old is now newagain and today schools and businesses are experimenting withgiving their students and employees adjustable height desks thatallow them the options to stand or sit.   For many of us, “working” means sitting in front of a comput-er for eight hours a day, fve days a week (or more). Add to thatdriving to and from work, sitting for meals, relaxing in front ofthe television or with a book, and suddenly you realize that mostof your awake time is spent sitting, or rather, in the most recentjargon, you spend most of the day being sedentary. Even if youexercise religiously for 1 or even 2 hours each day, you may stillbe considered a “couch potato” given the total amount of timethat you sit, because the amount of time that you spend beingsedentary affects your health. Sitting for long periods brings health risks which are separatefrom the risks attributed to not exercising. Recent studies haveshown that sitting for 6 hours or more each day has seriousdeleterious health effects.SITTING TOO MUCH CAN:•\t increase \tyour \trisk \tof \tdiabetes, \theart \tdisease \tand \tobesity \t\t•\t shorten \tyour \tlife \t•\t negatively \timpact \twaist \tcircumference, \tblood \tsugar, \tand \t  cholesterol  All of these health risks are increased if you are female or  overweight.  In addition to long-term health effects, sitting for too long canlead to multiple acute discomforts such as low back pain, andswelling, tingling or numbness of the lower legs or feet causedby restricted blood fow. Are you ready to jump out of your chairyet? When you do, remember to change position frequently.In addition to low back pain and restricted blood fow, thosewho stand for extended amounts of time complain of foot and legpain, bunions, corns, heel spurs, plantar fasciitis, Achilles ten-donitis, and varicose veins. Prolonged standing is not encouragedany more than prolonged sitting. The idea is having theoption to stand, which provides and encourages change of posi-tion throughout the work day. The benefts of incorporatingmore standing during the day are numerous. Standing more dur-ing the day can have the following positive health effects:•\t increased metabolism and calorie burning •\t increased blood flow •\t improved muscle tone •\t increased energy and concentration •\t improved posture If you’re interested in burning extra calories, a standing desk can help you burn about 150 to 200 extra calories over a sitting one. Check out www.juststand.org and use their calculator to see how many calories you can burn in a day of standing.

Its purpose is to promote walking and bicycling to school as a way to increase physical activ-ity among students, reduce traffc congestion and air pollution caused by traffc 2 beet roots, diced Nutrition Facts4 garlic cloves, peeled per servingand minced Serving size: ½ cup1 teaspoon ground cumin Calories: 3531 teaspoon fresh rosemary, Total Fat: 11g fnely chopped Saturated fat: 1.5g3 Tablespoons extra virgin Carbohydrate: 70golive oil Fiber: 12g3 Tablespoons lemon juice Protein: 7g½ teaspoon paprika Sodium: 233 mgSalt and black pepper, to taste 1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spread the pumpkin, potatoes, onion, and fennel on a baking sheet. Put the beets on a smaller, separate baking sheet so they don’t color the other vegetables. 2. In a small bowl, whisk the garlic, cumin, rosemary, olive oil, lemon juice, paprika, salt and pepper. Drizzle on top of vegetables and toss to coat. 3. Roast for 25-35 minutes, until vegetables are soft but not mushy. Allow vegetables to cool before adding the beets.

WRTSD, held the frst Wednesday of October, took place on October 5th this year. Sixty-nine schools from across the state and around 10,000 students participated. Each school decides how to celebrate WRTSD, but typical events include WRTSD parades, school assemblies, pedestrian safety classes, bicycle rodeos, poster contests, Walking School Buses, Bicycle Trains, WRTSD proclamations, guest speakers and local media cover-age. Helmet giveaways and fttings are also often used to promote helmet use, in keeping with the NM Child Helmet Saftey Act.   The NM Safe Routes to School (NM SRTS) program collabo-rates with the PRC each year to track the number of schools and students participating, encourage schools and communi-ties to get involved, and provide technical assistance. The pro-gram helps to distribute incentive items like refective zipper pulls and NM SRTS pencils to schools to give to students that walk or “roll” (on bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, wheel-chairs and scooters) to school that day.   Some of the WRTSD highlights this year included seniors from the Senior Center walking with Head Start students at the Pueblo de Jemez, giant puppets escorting the WRTSD parade in Silver City, and the entire student body at Valley View Elementary in Las Cruces walking and dancing around the playing feld to a tune from the movie Madagascar – “You got to move it, MOVE IT.” For more information please contact Leona Woelk at (505) 272-4462 or email at LWoelk@salud.unm.edu.

A small perturbation causes gradual change in spatial location of spiral’srotation center and frequency, i.e. drift. The response functions (RFs) of a spiral wave are the eigenfunctionsof the adjoint linearized operator corresponding to the critical eigenvalues λ = 0,±iω.

INTRODUCTIONAutowave vortices, or spiral waves in two-dimensions (2D),are types of self-organization observed in dissipative media ofphysical [1–4], chemical [5–7], and biological nature [8–13],where wave propagation is supported by a source of energystored in the medium. The common feature of all these phe-nomena is that they can be mathematically described, withvarious degrees of accuracy, by reaction-diffusion partial dif-ferential equations,∂tu = f(u) +D∇2u, u, f ∈ Rℓ, D ∈ Rℓ×ℓ, ℓ ≥ 2, (1)where u(~r, t) = (u1, . . . uℓ)T is a column-vector of thereagent concentrations, f(u) = (f1, . . . fℓ)T is a column-vector of the reaction rates, D is the matrix of diffusion coef-ficients, and ~r ∈ R2 is the vector of coordinates on the plane.The existence of vortices is not due to singularities in themedium but is determined only by development from initialconditions. A rigidly rotating spiral wave solution to the sys-tem (1) has the formU˜ = U(ρ(~r − ~R), ϑ(~r − ~R) + ωt− Φ), (2)∗Present: The University of Potsdam, Campus Golm,Department of Physicsand Astronomy (Haus 28), Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 24/25, 14476 Potsdam,Germanywhere ρ(~r − ~R), ϑ(~r − ~R) are polar coordinates centered at~R, vector ~R = (X,Y )T defines the center of rotation, and Φis the initial rotation phase. For a steady, i.e. rigidly rotating,spiral ~R and Φ are constants. The system of reference co-rotating with the spiral’s initial phase and angular velocity ωaround the spiral’s center of rotation is called the system ofreference of the spiral. In this system of reference, ~R = 0,Φ = 0, and the polar angle is given by θ = ϑ + ωt. In thisframe the spiral wave solution U(ρ, θ) does not depend ontime and satisfies the equationf(U) − ωUθ +D∇2U = 0. (3)In this equation, the unknowns are the field U(ρ, θ) and thescalar ω.A slightly perturbed steady spiral wave solutionU˜(ρ, θ, t) = U(ρ, θ) + ǫg(ρ, θ, t), g ∈ Rℓ, 0 < ǫ≪ 1,substituted in (1), at leading order in ǫ, yields the evolutionequation for the perturbation g,∂tg = ∂uf(U)g − ω∂θg+D∇2g.Thus, the linear stability spectrum of a steady spiralLV = λV (4)is defined by the linearized operatorL = D∇2 − ω∂θ + ∂uf(U). (5)2The operator L has critical (Re (λ) = 0) eigenvaluesλn = inω, n = 0,±1, (6)which correspond to eigenfunctions related to equivariance of(1) with respect to translations and rotations, i.e. “Goldstonemodes” (GMs) [14–17]V(0) = −∂θU(ρ, θ),V(±1) = −12e∓iθ(∂ρ ∓ iρ−1∂θ)U(ρ, θ). (7)The stability spectra of steady spiral waves was originally ob-tained numerically by Barkley [16]. Subsequently the spec-trum was analysed for infinite and large bounded domains bySandstede and Scheel [18–20] with follow-on numerical in-vestigations by Wheeler and Barkley [21] confirming the largedomain behavior of the stability spectrum.In a slightly perturbed problem∂tu = f(u) +D∇2u+ ǫh, h ∈ Rℓ, 0 < ǫ≪ 1, (8)where ǫh(u, ~r, t) is some small perturbation, spiral wavesmay drift, i.e.change rotational phase and/or center location.Then, the center of rotation and the initial phase are no longerconstants but become functions of time, ~R = ~R(t) andΦ = Φ(t).In linear approximation, assuming that~˙R, Φ˙ = O(ǫ),the drifting spiral wave solution can be represented asU˜ = U(ρ(~r− ~R(t)), ϑ(~r− ~R(t))+ωt−Φ(t))+ǫg(~r, t), (9)where ǫg(~r, t) is a small perturbation of the steady spiralwave solution U.Then, the solution perturbation g in the laboratory frame ofreference will satisfy the linearized system(∂t − D∇2 − ∂uf(U))g= h(u, ~r, t)−1ǫ( ~˙R · ∇+ Φ˙∂θ)U. (10)The solvalability condition for equation (10) for g , i.e. Fred-holm alternative, re-written in the spiral frame of reference,requires that the free term must be orthogonal to the kernelof the adjoint operator to L defined in (5). This leads to thefollowing system of equations for the drift velocitiesΦ˙ = ǫF0(~R, t), ~˙R = ǫ ~F1(~R, t). (11)Thus, the drift velocities Φ˙ and ~˙R are determined by the“forces” F0 and ~F1 = (Re (F1) , Im (F1))T which, after slid-ing averaging (more specifically, central moving average) overthe spiral wave rotation period, can be expressed [15] asFn(~R, t) = einΦt+π/ω∮t−π/ωωdτ2πe−inωτ×〈W(n)(ρ(~r − ~R), ϑ(~r − ~R) + ωτ − Φ), h(~r, τ)〉,n = 0,±1. (12)(of course, F−1 = F¯1). Here 〈· , ·〉 stands for the scalar prod-uct in functional space,〈w , v〉 =∫R2w(~r)Tv(~r) d2~r.The kernels W(n) of convolution-type integrals in (12) arethe spiral wave’s response functions (RFs), i.e., the criticaleigenfunctionsL+W(n) = µnW(n), (13)whereµn = −iωn, n = 0,±1, (14)of the adjoint linearized operator:L+ = D∇2 + ω∂θ + (∂uf(U))T, (15)chosen to be biorthogonal〈W(j) , V(k)〉= δj,k, (16)to the Goldstone modes (7). Note that the RFs do not dependon time, i.e. are functions of the coordinates only, in the co-rotating system of reference.The asymptotic theory just outlined reduces the descriptionof the smooth dynamics of spiral waves from the system ofnonlinear partial differential equations (1) to the system of or-dinary differential equations (11), describing the movementof the core of the spiral and the shift of its angular velocity.Several qualitative results in the asymptotic theory of spiraland scroll dynamics have been obtained without the use of re-sponse functions, e.g. [15, 17, 22–30]. However, an explicitknowledge of RFs makes possible a quantitative description,which obviously can be much more efficient for the under-standing and control of spiral wave dynamics in numerous ap-plications, e.g. control of re-entry in the heart.The asymptotic properties of the RFs at large distancesare crucial for convergence of the convolution integrals in(12). An early version of the asymptotic theory, developedby Keener [31] for scroll wave dynamics, considered the RFsasymptotically periodic in the limit ρ→∞, in much the sameway as spiral waves are, thus requiring an artifical cut-off pro-cedure to tackle the divergence of the integrals in (12) follow-ing from such an asumption.Based on observations and empirical data of spiral wavedynamics, Biktashev [14, 32] conjectured that the responsefunctions quickly decay at large ρ, i.e. are effectively local-ized. This conjecture implies that the integrals in (12) con-verge and no cut-off procedure is required.To prove existence of the localized responce functions, Bik-tasheva et al. [33] explicitly computed them in the complexGinzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) for a particular set of pa-rameters. Those computations exploited an additional sym-metry present in the CGLE, which permitted the reduction ofthe 2D problem to the computation of 1D components. Thecomputations were verified by numerical convergence of the3method with respect to the space discretisation and the sizeof the medium. Following this work, the computed RFs weresuccessfully used for quantitative prediction of the spiral’s res-onant drift and drift due to media inhomogeneity [34, 35]. Byexplicitly computing the RFs in the CGLE for a broad rangeof the model’s parameters, Biktasheva and Biktashev [36, 37]showed that the RFs are localized for stable spiral wave solu-tions and qualitatively change at crossing the charachteristiclines in the model parameter plane.Recently, there has been a significant theoretical progressin mathematical treatment of the localization of the responsefunctions. Sandstede and Scheel [38, Corollary 4.6] analyti-cally proved such localization for one-dimensional wave dis-locations, which may be considered as analogues of a spiralwave in one spatial dimension. Hopefully this can be extendedto two spatial dimensions, i.e. to spiral waves.For cardiac applications, dynamics of spiral waves in ex-citable media is more important than in oscillatory media suchas the CGLE, as most cardiac tissues are excitable. Thesemodels do not allow reduction to 1D, making quantitativelyaccurate computation of the response functions more chal-lenging. So far, the response functions have been computedin the Barkley [39, 40] and FitzHugh-Nagumo [41] modelsof excitable media. For the chosen sets of model parameters,the computed RFs appeared effectively localized in the vicin-ity of the spiral wave core. Hamm [39] and Biktasheva etal. [41] calculated RFs on Cartesian grids, but the accuracywas not sufficient for quantitative prediction of drift. Hakimand Henry [40] took the advantage of a polar grid and Barkleymodel to compute the spiral wave solution with an accuracyof 10−8 and RFs with accuracy 10−6 (both in the sense ofl2-norm of the residue of the discretized equations) leading toquantitative prediction of drift velocities with about 4% accu-racy.Encouraging as these results are, there is a need for a morecomputationally efficient, accurate and robust method to com-pute the response functions of spiral waves in a variety of ex-citable media with required accuracy. The aim of this paperis to present a method which is superior to previous methodsused to compute response functions and to demonstrate that itworks for stationary rotating spirals in FitzHugh-Nagumo sys-tem. We also demonstrate convergence of the method with re-spect to the computational parameters, i.e. discretization stepsand size of the medium, and show that the method is vastlymore efficient than the methods used before [40, 41].II. METHODSA. ComputationsTo compute the response functions, we use methods similarto those described in [16, 21].The nonlinear problem (3) is considered on a disk ρ ≤ρmax, with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions,∂ρU(ρmax, θ) = 0. The fields are discretized on a regularpolar grid (ρj , θk) = (j∆ρ, k∆θ) where 0 < j ≤ Nρ and0 ≤ k < Nθ plus the center point ρ = 0. Hence there areNρNθ+1 grid points and correspondinglyN = ℓ(NρNθ+1)unknowns and the same number of equations in the discretiza-tion of (3). For the inner points j < Nρ, the ρ-derivativesare calculated via second-order central differences. The θ-derivatives are calculated using Fornberg’s weights.f sub-routine [42] which uses all Nθ values so, in theory, providesan approximation of θ-derivatives of the order of Nθ. The dis-cretization of the Laplacian at the center point is via the differ-ence between the average around the innermost circle ρ = ∆ρand the center point, and the approximation at j = Nρ takesinto account the boundary conditions at ρ = ρmax.The discretized nonlinear steady-state spiral problem (3)is solved by Newton’s method, starting from initial approx-imations obtained by interpolation of results of simulations ofthe time-dependent problem (1) using EZSPIRAL. The New-ton iterations involve inversion of the linearized matrix whichhas a banded structure with the bandwidth 1 + 2ℓNθ. This isachieved by the appropriate ordering of the unknowns of thediscretized problem within the N -dimensional vector of un-knowns, so that the index enumerating components of reagentvectors from Rℓ varied fastest, followed by the index enumer-ating angular grid points k∆θ, followed by the index enumer-ating the radial grid points j∆ρ.The thus posed discretized nonlinear problem inherits thesymmetry of (3) with respect to rotations. To select aunique solution out of a family of solutions generated bythis symmetry, we impose a “pinning condition” of the formUℓ∗(j∗∆ρ, k∗∆θ) = u∗, where ℓ∗, u∗ and j∗ may be selectedarbitrarily and k∗ is chosen as the θ-grid point in the ρ = j∗∆ρcircle that gives the ℓ∗-component value closest to u∗ in theinitial approximation. Since Uℓ∗(j∗∆ρ, k∗∆θ) is fixed, it isno longer an unknown, and its place in the RN -vector of un-knowns is taken by ω, also to be found from (3). In this way,the balance of the unknowns and equations is preserved. Asω is present in all equations, the corresponding non-zero col-umn of the linearization matrix destroys the bandedness of thematrix. This obstacle is overcome by employing the Sherman-Morrison formula [43] to find solutions of the correspondinglinear systems using only banded matrices. Newton iterationsare performed until the residual in solution of the discretizedversion of equation (3) becomes sufficiently small.The linearized problems (4) and (13) are considered in thesame domain with similar boundary conditions. The criticaleigenvalues and eigenvectors of the discretized operators Land L+ are computed with the help of a complex shift andCayley transform.For a matrix L, be it discretization of L or L+, the complexshift is defined asA = L+ iκIand the subsequent Cayley transform asB = (ξI+A)−1(ηI+A) (17)where κ, ξ and η are real parameters and I is the identity ma-trix. If λ, α and β are eigenvalues of L, A and B, respectively,this impliesα = λ+ iκ, β =η + αξ + α.4The selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the thus con-structed matrices B are then found by the Arnoldi method,using ARPACK [44].We have used ξ = 0, η = 1 and κ = 0,∓ω when seeking,respectively, V(0,±1) and W(0,∓1), where ω is the solutionof the corresponding nonlinear problem previously obtained.With this choice of ξ, η and κ, the numerical eigenvalues λˆand µˆ closest to the theoretical critical eigenvalues (6) and (14)correspondingly, generate the largest |β|. Hence, the Arnoldimethod in each case is required to obtain the eigenvalue withthe largest absolute value.To normalize the eigenvectors, we use the “analytical”Goldstone modes V˘(k), obtained by numerical differentiationof the numerical spiral wave solution Uˆ, namely,V˘(0) = −∂θUˆ(ρ, θ),V˘(±1) = −12e∓iθ(∂ρ ∓ iρ−1∂θ)Uˆ(ρ, θ),where differentiation has been implemented using the samediscretization schemes as used in calculations.First, the response functions Wˆ(k) computed by ARPACKare normalized with respect to the “analytical” Goldstonemodes V˘(k) so that〈Wˆ(k) , V˘(k)〉= 1, k = 0,±1,where numerical integration involved in 〈· , ·〉 has been carriedout using the trapezoidal rule.Then, the “numerical” Goldstone modes Vˆ(k) computed byARPACK are normalized with respect to the normalized re-sponse functions so that〈Wˆ(k) , Vˆ(k)〉= 1, k = 0,±1.Thus, we finally obtain• a numerical solution for the spiral wave problem (3) to-gether with the angular velocity ω,• “analytical” Goldstone modes V˘(k),• normalized “numerical” Goldstone modes Vˆ(k), and• normalized response functions Wˆ(k).B. AnalysisTo validate the computed response functions, we have todemonstrate convergence of the solution with respect to thenumerical approximation parameters such as the size of themedium ρmax, and the discretization steps ∆ρ and ∆θ.First of all, we have to demonstrate convergence of thecomputed eigenvalues of λˆn and µˆn to their theoretical values(6) and (14), taking forω its numerical approximation ωˆ foundby numerical solving the discretized problem (3). Since the“theoretical” value for ω is not available, we can only checkconvergence of ωˆ to some limit.The accuracy of the “numerical” Goldstone modes is quan-tified by the distance between the “numerical” and “analyti-cal” Goldstone modes, in L2 normDj =∫S∣∣∣V˘(j)(~r)− Vˆ(j)(~r)∣∣∣2 d2~r1/2as well as C0 normD′j = max~r∈S∣∣∣V˘(j)(~r)− Vˆ(j)(~r)∣∣∣over a disk S of half the radius of the computational domain:S = {~r : |~r| ≤ ρmax/2}.The smaller disk is used to exclude the effects of boundaryconditions. The issue is that the exact GM V˘ do not satisfyNeumann boundary conditions whereas Vˆ do, hence there isan inevitable deviation between them near ρ = ρmax, whichis an artefact of restricting our problem to a finite domain, andis not indicative of the accuracy of the computed Wˆ, whichare expected to be exponentially small near ρ = ρmax.The accuracy of the computed response functions Wˆ couldbe tested directly in the same way as the accuracy of the com-puted ωˆ, i.e. by the numerical convergence to some limit. Thisis however, difficult to implement for the numerical solutionsobtained on different grids. Nevertheless, we are able to ex-amine the convergence in ∆ρ where coarser grids are subgridsof the finer grids by restricting the fine-grid solutions to thecoarse grid, without the need for any interpolation. Specifi-cally, we calculateEj =∫B∣∣∣Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r)− Wˆ(j)∆ρ∗(~r)∣∣∣2 d2~r1/2andE ′j = max~r∈B∣∣∣Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r)− Wˆ(j)∆ρ∗(~r)∣∣∣over the whole computational domainB = {~r : |~r| ≤ ρmax},where Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r) are the numerical response functions calcu-lated at the radius step ∆ρ which is an integer multiple of theminimal radius step ∆ρ∗, and the finest numerical responsefunctions Wˆ(j)∆ρ∗(~r) have been restricted to the coarser gridof Wˆ(j)∆ρ(~r) of the solution to which they are compared, sothe numerical integration is done over the coarser grid. Notethat in the series with varying ρmax and fixed ∆θ and ∆ρ, thecoarser grids are also subgrids of the finer grids, but as thepinning point is defined via ρmax, solutions at different ρmaxare again not directly comparable to each other so this seriesis not used in this comparison.5We also assess accuracy indirectly via the bi-orthogonalitybetween the response functions and the Goldstone modes re-quired by (16). Specifically, we examine the orthogonality ofthe RFs to the “analytical” GMs, quantified byOa =∑j=0,±1∑k=0,±1∣∣∣〈Wˆ(j) , V˘(k)〉− δj,k∣∣∣2 (18)and orthogonality of the RFs to the “numerical” GMs quanti-fied byOn =∑j=0,±1∑k=0,±1∣∣∣〈Wˆ(j) , Vˆ(k)〉− δj,k∣∣∣2 .Note, that by construction the diagonal elements of both the“numerical” and “analytical” bi-orthogonality matrices hereare all equal to 1 up to round-off errors.The measures Oa and On require some discussion. The bi-orthogonality should be exact for exact RFs and GMs. How-ever, what we calculate are approximations of these functions,subject to discretization in ρ and θ and restriction to a finitedomain ρ ≤ ρmax. The bi-orthogonality of numerical solu-tions is therefore not exact and its deviation from the ideal isan indication of the accuracy of calculation, and its conver-gence in ∆ρ, ∆θ and ρmax is an indication, albeit indirect, ofthe accuracy of the solutions.In more detail, if the the matrices representing discretiza-tion of L and L+ were transposes of one another, then theireigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues would beexactly orthogonal in l2, and so a measure of their orthog-onality would not depend on the spatial discretization butonly on the accuracy of the calculation of the eigenvectors byARPACK. However, L and L+ are conjugate with respect tothe scalar product which is approximated by a discrete innerproduct with a weight, hence the matrices of L and L+ arenot transposed. Moreover, because of the approximation usedfor these operators (e.g. high-order approximation in ∆θ vssecond-order approximation in ∆ρ), the corresponding matri-ces are not adjoint of each other with respect to the weightedl2 either. So, On provides a measure of the consistency ofthese matrix representations together with the accuracy withwhich the eigenvectors are computed with ARPACK.Moreover, apart from the question of accuracy of findingthe eigenvectors of the discretized operators and accuracy offinding the eigenfunctions of the original continuous opera-tors, there remains a question of whether the found eigenvec-tors and eigenfunctions are the ones that we need, that corre-spond to 0 and±iω, rather than eigenfunctions correspondingto eigenvalues which happened to be close to 0 and ±iω [49].For the GMs, the answer to this question is ensured by check-ing the distanceDj ; however, this answer is not absolute as thecomparison is made only over part of the disk, for reasons dis-cussed above. We note, however, that the L+ eigenfunctionscorresponding to the eigenvalues close to but different from0,±iω, are orthogonal to the GMs and for them Oa would benot small [50]. Since Oa is defined in terms of scalar productswith the mode determined directly from the underlying spiralwave, its smallness provides the additional assurance that theadjoint eigenfunctions are indeed the RFs that we are after,not just some adjoint eigenfunctions.III. RESULTSA. GeneralWe have tested our method for computing the responsefunctions in the case of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, ℓ = 2,f1 = ε−1(u1 − u31/3− u2),f2 = ε(u1 − au2 + b),D =[1 00 0], with parameters a = 0.5, b = 0.68, ε = 0.3.For pinning, we have used ℓ∗ = 2, u∗ = 0.1 and j∗ = Nρ/2.Newton iterations have been performed until the Euclidean(l2) norm of the residual in the discretized nonlinear equa-tion falls below 10−8. For comparison, we have also runcases, discussed later in fig. 5, in which iterations continueuntil the norm of the residual no longer decreases (typicallysuch norms were below 10−9 down to 10−13). The tolerancein ARPACK’s routines znaupd and zneupd has been setto the default “machine epsilon”. For the Krylov subspacedimensionality we have tried 3 and 10, with no perceptibledifference in either the numerical results.Before discussing the performance of our numerical tech-niques, we briefly present typical solutions. Figures 1 and 2illustrate the spiral wave solution and the GMs and RFs forρmax = 25, Nρ = 1280 and Nθ = 64. This solution istaken as the best achievable given memory restrictions (4Gbof real memory). The angular velocity for it was found to beωˆ ≈ 0.5819341748776017. For the GMs and RFs, we showthe n = 0 and n = 1 modes only, since the calculated n = −1modes are almost exactly the complex conjugates of the n = 1modes, which of course they should be.One can see that the GMs Vˆ are indeed proportional to cor-responding derivatives of the spiral wave solution Uˆ, and thatthe RFs Wˆ are localized in a small region of the spiral tip andare indistinguishable from zero outside that region.The character of the RFs’ decay with distance is illustratedin more detail in fig. 3. We plot the angle-averaged values ofthe solutions, defined as〈X〉(n)i (ρ) =12π∮Xˆ(n)i (ρ, θ) dθ,for X = U, V and W . Note the difference in the behaviorof 〈U〉(n)i and 〈V 〉(n)i on one hand and 〈W 〉(n)i on the otherhand. In the semilogarithmic (linear for horizontal axis, log-arithmic for vertical axis) coordinates of fig. 3(c) the graphsof 〈W 〉(n)i (ρ) are straight for a large range of ρ, not too closeto 0 or ρmax = 25, and for several decades of magnitude of〈W 〉(n)i . This shows clearly the expected exponential localiza-tion of the RFs. For comparison, we also show convergenceof ωˆ = ωˆ(ρmax) in a disk as a function of the disk radiusρmax. Theory [36, 45–47] predicts that the 〈W 〉(n)i (ρ) and∆ω(ρmax) = ωˆ(ρmax)− ωˆ(∞) dependencies should both bedecaying exponentials with the same characteristic exponent;this agrees well with the numerical results shown in fig. 3(c).6FIG. 1: Solutions of the nonlinear problem (3) and the linearized problem (4,5), i.e. the Goldstone modes, at the “best” parameters, ρmax = 25,Nρ = 1280, Nθ = 64, as density plots. Numbers under the density plots are their amplitudes A: white of the plot corresponds to the value Aand black corresponds to the value −A of the designated field. Upper row: 1st components, lower row: 2d components.FIG. 2: Same visualization as in fig. 1, for the adjoint linearized problem (13,15), i.e. the response functions.7FIG. 3: Radial dependence of the angle-averaged solutions for the spiral wave (a), Goldstone modes (b) and response functions (c). In (c), thedependence of ∆ω(ρmax) = ωˆ(ρmax) − ωˆ(25) is shown for comparison, where ωˆ(ρmax) is the numerically found spiral angular velocity inthe disk of given radius ρmax.Sandstede and Scheel [19, 20] have computed exponentialdecay/increase rates of eigenfunctions of periodic wavetrainsin one spatial dimension. A similar technique should, in prin-ciple, also work for the adjoint eigenfunctions. Knowning theasymptotic wavelength of the spiral wave, this can be used topredict the exponential decay rates of the RFs of spiral waves.As can be seen from the results of Wheeler and Barkley [21],although such correspondence between 1D and 2D calcula-tions can be established, the accuracy of decay rate estimatesfor two-dimensional eigenfunctions achieved in this way is in-sufficient for a meaningful estimate of the accuracy of thoseeigenfunctions.B. ConvergenceWe now turn to the main results of our study. Convergenceof the method has been tested by changing one of the threenumerical approximation parameters ρmax, Nρ and Nθ whilekeeping the other two at the fixed values set by the “best ex-ample”. More specifically, while changing ρmax, we considertwo variants: one with fixed Nθ , and one with changing Nθso that the combination ρmax∆θ, which is the size of the out-ermost computational cells in the angular direction, remainsconstant.Fig. 4 illustrates the results of the study, where the fourcolumns correspond to different series of calculations, and thethree rows correspond to the three different methods of as-sessing the accuracy: closeness of the eigenvalues to the theo-retical values, distance between “numerical” and “analytical”GMs and orthogonality between non-dual RFs and GMs. Thescales of ∆ρ, ∆θ and the error estimates are logarithmic, andthe scales of ρmax are linear. Here shown is the distance be-tween the “numerical” and “analytical” Goldstone modes inL2 norm, the distance in C0 norm looks similar.A typical feature on many of the curves is a “knee”-shape,when the measure of the error decreases as ρmax grows or ∆θor ∆ρ decrease, but only until a certain point, beyond whichit reaches a plateau. This behavior is expected and explicable.The calculation error is affected by many factors, and if thefactor varied in a particular series becomes negligible, then theerror remains at a constant level determined by fixed values ofother factors.The position of the “knees” on the curves indicates thatthe accuracy of the rotational (n = 0) modes would be im-proved if ∆θ were further decreased (there are no knees onthe curves corresponding to the rotational modes, red online,in the fourth, i.e. rightmost column), whereas the limiting pa-rameter for the translational (n = 1) modes is ∆ρ (thereare no knees on the curves corresponding to the tanslationalmodes, blue online, in the third column). The analysis ofthe first two columns is more complicated. The errors esti-mates at the maximal ρmax are similar in both columns asthey correspond to the same “best” spiral. These limit val-ues are achieved, i.e. plateaux are observed, at much smallerρmax values if ∆θ = const, than if ρmax∆θ = const. This isbecause reduction of ρmax at fixed ∆θ produces an additionalimprovement of approximation due to the angular discretiza-tion. When ρmax∆θ is kept fixed, as in the first column, thedependence of the solution on the disk radius is without thisextra benefit.The rates of convergence with respect to parameters can beassessed by the slopes of the curves above the knees beforethey plateau. In some cases the data is somewhat irregular,primarily at parameters corresponding to lower values of er-ror estimates. This is not unexpected and we attribute it to in-complete convergence of the iterative procedures (see below).On the whole, the slopes can be determined clearly from theseplots.The constant slope in the first (leftmost) and the secondcolumns corresponds to the exponential convergence withρmax. The constant slope in the third column corresponds topower-law convergence, and the typical slope is 2. This iswell seen on the curves for translational modes, blue online,and not well on the curves for rotational modes, red online,which are very small anyway. Slope 2 in the third columnis to be expected as our discretization is second-order in ∆ρin all cases. The curves in the fourth (rightmost) column areconvex, which is consistent with the fact that the order of ap-proximation is Nθ , which varies along the curve as ∆θ varies,since Nθ = 2π/∆θ, so the slope is bigger for smaller ∆θ. Inother words, the high order of the Fornberg approximation ofthe θ derivatives implies the convergence in ∆θ is faster thanany fixed power.8FIG. 4: Convergence in numerical parameters: of deviation of the numerical eigenvalues from theoretical (upper row), of L2 distance betweennumerical and theoretical eigenfunctions (second row) and of orthogonality, i.e. Frobenius norm of the difference of the matrix of scalarproducts of eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions from the unity matrix (third row), all in logarithmic scales, as dependencies of diskradius (first and second columns, linear scale), radius discretization step (third column, logarithmic scale) and polar angle discretization step(fourth column, logarithmic scale). In the first column, ρmax is changed while the values of ∆ρ and R∆θ are kept constant. In the secondcolumn, ρmax is changed while ∆ρ and ∆θ are kept constant.FIG. 5: (a,b) Effect of the accuracy of the unperturbed spiral wave solution on the convergence: (a) Newton-iteration tolerance 10−8. (b)Newton iterations until the norm of the residual stopped decreasing. (c) Convergence of the response functions in ∆ρ.The irregular shape of some of the curves in fig. 4 at verylow values of the error estimates is related to the accuracy offinding the spiral solution and is ulitmately affected by theprecision of floating point computations. Note that all cal-culations in fig. 4 have been performed with a tolerance of10−8 for Newton iterations of the spiral wave and some of thecurves fall as low as 10−15 i.e. close to machine epsilon. Achange in the tolerance of the Newton iteration reduces irreg-ularities in the curves at low values, as shown in fig. 5(a,b).Finally, fig. 5(c) illustrates convergence of numerical RFs9Wˆ(0,1) as ∆ρ → 0, calculated as the L2-distance E0,1 be-tween the solutions at a given resultion ∆ρ and the “best”solution calculated at the smallest ∆ρ∗ = 25/1280. As ex-plained in the Sec. II B, this comparsion has been restrictedto the series of calculations with varying ∆ρ, where grids atlower resolutions were subgrids of those with higher resolu-tions. The graphs of C0 distances E ′0,1 looked similar and arenot shown here.IV. DISCUSSIONThe main result of this paper is a general, robust method forobtaining response functions for rigidly rotating spiral wavesin excitable media with required accuracy.We have tested the method on the FitzHugh-Nagumo modeland we have studied the convergence of spiral wave solutionsand eigenfunctions, both the Goldstone modes and the re-sponse functions, with respect to the numerical approximationparameters ρmax, Nρ and Nθ . The rates of convergence arefound to agree with the order of approximation and indicatethe accuracy with which solutions can be found for particularnumerical parameters.The slowest (second-order) convergence is, as expected, inthe parameterNρ. Thus in a typical situation, an improvementof accuracy requires, other things being equal, an increase ofNρ, with associated increase in memory and time demands.Thus, the most promising avenue of further development ofthe method is via increase of the approximation order of theradial derivatives. This is, of course, subject to usual caveatthat the degree of approximation should be consistent with theactual smoothness of the solutions.The method used here to solve the eigenvalue problems foroperators L relies on successive application of transforma-tions of L applied to a sequence of vectors, alternating withGram-Schmidt orthogonalization. These are typical ideas,also used in [40, 41]. The difference is that in [40, 41], the lin-ear transformations were polynomial functions of L whereaswe use rational functions of L. The polynomial iterations usedin [40, 41] were in fact equivalent to solving a Cauchy prob-lem for equation du/dt = Lu by the explicit Euler method.Therefore, those methods require a large number of iterations,and convergence speed of the iterations depends on the small-ness of the absolute difference of the real parts of the eigen-values of interest compared to those of other eigenvalues. Onerequires at least O(105) and typically O(106) sparse matrix-vector multiplications to achieve the desired solutions to theeigenvalue problem using such an approach.In contrast, with the complex shift and inversion of L usedin this paper, the convergence speed of the iterations dependson the smallness of the distance of the eigenvalues from theirtheoretical values used in the complex shift, compared to thedistance to other eigenvalues. Hence the number of iterationsrequired is very small, typically O(10). More specifically,with Krylov subspace dimensionality 3, the number of ma-trix multiplications with matrix B of (17) did not exceed 7per one eigenpair; with Krylov subspace dimensionality 10,this number rose to 10. The price to pay for this accelera-tion is the necessity to solve large systems of linear equations.However, the key observation is that since the linear systemis fixed, it needs to be factorized only once, for a given com-plex shift, and used for all iterations. Multiplication by ma-trix B is achieved with only inexpensive back/forward solves.Moreover, due to the way we ordered the unknowns in thediscretized problem, the sparcity of matrix B does not dependon the order of approximation of θ-derivatives. Hence, we areable to employ high-order approximations requiring far fewerpoints in the θ direction for the same accuracy as the second-order finite difference discretization used in [40], thereby fur-ther improving the efficiency of our method.Discounting the factorization step, each iteration, which in-volves multiplication by B, is comparable to multiplicationsby L. In practice we find that the factorization itself doesnot require more than the equivalent of four to six actions ofB. On a MacPro with 3 GHz Intel processor, the factorizationstep takes e.g. about 7.5 sec for the gridNρ = 1280,Nθ = 64,and 0.67 sec for the grid Nρ = 640, Nθ = 32; the compu-tation times per B-multiplication were 1.23 sec and 0.17 secrespectively.The comparison of our present method with [41] is un-equivocal: matrix inverses were not used there, and it wasadmitted already in [41] that the resulting accuracy of solu-tions was severely limited. While direct accuracy and timingcomparisons with [40] would be most convincing, that codeis not publicly available. However, for reasons already noted,on any given polar grid, the method we report is more accu-rate due to the angular discretization and considerably fasterin floating-point operations.The computed response functions are localized in the vicin-ity of the spiral wave tip and exponentially decay with dis-tance from it. This localization ensures convergence of theconvolution integral in (12) in an unbounded domain.The eigenvectors of the linearized operator, i.e. Goldstonemodes and of its adjoint, i.e. the response functions have beencomputed using the same technique, so the qualitatively dif-ferent behavior of these solutions at large ρ is not a numericalartefact, as it was not in any way assumed in the numericalmethod.Although the method has been used here to compute the re-sponse functions in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, none of thedetails of the method depends on any specifics of the partic-ular reaction kinetics and should be widely applicable to thecomputation of response functions of rigidly rotating waves inany other model of excitable tissue, as long as its right-handsides are continuously differentiable so the linarized theory isapplicable. Moreover, the method can also be extended in astraightforward way to include additional effects, such as theeffect of uniform twist along scroll waves with linear filamentsin three dimensions [17, 40, 48].AcknowledgementThis study has been supported in part by EPSRC grantsEP/D074789/1 and EP/D074746/1.10[1] T.

"arXiv:1905.08001v1  [math.CO]  20 May 2019The extremal number of longer subdivisionsOliver Janzer∗AbstractFor a multigraph F , the k-subdivision of F is the graph obtained by replacing theedges of F with pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length k+1. Conlon and Leeconjectured that if k is even, then the (k−1)-subdivision of any multigraph has extremalnumber O(n1+1k ), and moreover, that for any simple graph F there exists ε > 0 suchthat the (k − 1)-subdivision of F has extremal number O(n1+1k−ε). In this paper, weprove both conjectures.1 IntroductionFor a multigraph F , a subdivision of F is a graph obtained by replacing the edges of F withpairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of arbitrary lengths. The k-subdivision of F is thegraph obtained by replacing the edges of F with pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths oflength k + 1, and is denoted by F k.Many researchers have studied the problem of estimating the number of edges needed ina graph G on n vertices to guarantee that it contains as a subgraph a subdivided copy of afixed graph. The first result in this direction is due to Mader [12] who proved that for anygraph F there exists a constant cF = c such that if an n-vertex graph G contains at leastcn edges, then G contains a subdivision of F as a subgraph. In this result the size of thesubdivided graph can grow with n, which is necessary since an n-vertex graph with cn edgesneed not contain a cycle of bounded length.Answering a question of Erdo˝s about planar subgraphs [5], Kostochka and Pyber [11]proved that any n-vertex graph with at least 4t2n1+ε edges contains a subdivided Kt withat most 7t2 log tε vertices. This is the first result that guarantees a subdivided Kt of boundedsize.For a family F of graphs, we let ex(n,F) be the maximum number of edges in an n-vertexgraph not containing any F ∈ F as a subgraph. When F = {F}, we write ex(n, F ) for thesame function.Let Ft,k be the family of graphs that can be obtained by replacing the edges of Kt withpairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length at most k. Jiang [9] proved that for anyt ∈ N and any 0 < ε < 1/2, we have ex(n,Ft,⌈10/ε⌉) = O(n1+ε). Here the asymptotic notationmeans that n → ∞ and other parameters are constant. We follow the same conventionthroughout the paper.Note that Jiang’s result improves that of Kostochka and Pyber in two ways. Firstly, anyF ∈ Ft,⌈10/ε⌉ has at mostct2ε vertices, so a log factor is saved. Secondly, the edges in Jiang’stheorem are replaced by uniformly short paths not depending on t. However, they can stillhave different lengths. The next result of Jiang and Seiver guarantees a subdivided Kt withprescribed path lengths.Theorem 1.1 (Jiang–Seiver [10]). For any t ∈ N and any even k ∈ N,ex(n,Kk−1t ) = O(n1+ 16k ).∗Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge, United King-dom. E-mail: oj224@cam.ac.uk.1Note that if k is odd, then Kk−1t is not a bipartite graph, so ex(n,Kk−1t ) = Θ(n2).Conlon and Lee conjectured that the following two strengthenings hold.Conjecture 1.2 (Conlon–Lee [4]). Let F be a multigraph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Thenex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+1k ).Conjecture 1.3 (Conlon–Lee [4]). Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Thenthere exists some ε > 0 such thatex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+1k−ε).In the case k = 2, Conjecture 1.2 follows from the r = 2 case of a result of Fu¨redi [7] andAlon, Krivelevich and Sudakov [1], which states that any bipartite graph with maximum de-gree at most r on one side has extremal number O(n2−1/r). The k = 2 case of Conjecture 1.3was proved by Conlon and Lee [4], and improved bounds were given by the author [8].Very recently, Conlon, Janzer and Lee proved Conjecture 1.3 for every bipartite graph F .Theorem 1.4 (Conlon–Janzer–Lee [3]). Let F be a simple bipartite graph and let k ≥ 1.Then there exists some ε > 0 such thatex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+1k−ε).As a simple corollary, they significantly improved the bound in Theorem 1.1.Theorem 1.5 (Conlon–Janzer–Lee [3]). Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 2 be even.Then there exists some ε > 0 such thatex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+2k−ε).In this paper, we prove both Conjecture 1.2 and Conjecture 1.3.Theorem 1.6. Let F be a multigraph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Thenex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+1k ).Theorem 1.7. Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 2 be even. Then there exists some ε > 0such thatex(n, F k−1) = O(n1+1k−ε).Note that these results are tight. Indeed, by a result of Conlon [2], the Theta graphθk,ℓ has extremal number Θ(n1+1/k) for all ℓ ≥ ℓ0(k), showing that Theorem 1.6 is tight.Moreover, Erdo˝s-Re´nyi random graphs show that ex(n,Kk−1t ) = Ω(n1+1/k−ck,t) where ck,t →0 as t→∞, so Theorem 1.7 is also tight.The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some of thekey definitions and give the high-level structure of the proof, with the key technical lemmasdeferred to Sections 3 and 4.22 The high-level structure of the proofA graph G is called K-almost-regular if maxv∈V (G) d(v) ≤ Kminv∈V (G) d(v), where d(v) isthe degree of vertex v. The following lemma, which is a small modification of a result provedby Erdo˝s and Simonovits [6], allows us to restrict our attention to almost regular host graphs.Lemma 2.1 (Jiang–Seiver [10]). Let ε, c be positive reals, where ε < 1 and c ≥ 1. Let n bea positive integer that is sufficiently large as a function of ε. Let G be a graph on n verticeswith e(G) ≥ cn1+ε. Then G contains a K-almost-regular subgraph G′ on m ≥ nε−ε22+2ε verticessuch that e(G′) ≥ 2c5 m1+ε and K = 20 · 21ε2+1.Using this lemma, Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.7 reduce to the following two statements,respectively. For notational convenience, we have dropped the assumption that k is even,and replaced k by 2k.Theorem 2.2. Let F be a multigraph and let k ≥ 1. Suppose that G is a K-almost-regulargraph on n vertices with minimum degree δ = ω(n12k ). Then, for n sufficiently large, Gcontains a copy of F 2k−1.Theorem 2.3. Let F be a simple graph and let k ≥ 1. Then there exists ε > 0 with thefollowing property. Suppose that G is a K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimumdegree δ = ω(n12k−ε). Then, for n sufficiently large, G contains a copy of F 2k−1.From now on we let F be an arbitrary fixed multigraph and write H = F 2k−1. Moreover,throughout the paper we tacitly assume that n is sufficiently large.The next definition was introduced in [3], and was used to prove Theorem 1.4.Definition 2.4. Let L be a positive real and let f(ℓ, L) = L5ℓfor 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k. We recursivelydefine the notions of L-admissible and L-good paths of length ℓ in a graph. Any path oflength 1 is both L-admissible and L-good. For 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k, we say a path P = v0v1 . . . vℓis L-admissible if every proper subpath of P is L-good, i.e., vivi+1 . . . vj is L-good for every(i, j) 6= (0, ℓ). The path P is L-good if it is L-admissible and the number of L-admissiblepaths of length ℓ between v0 and vℓ is at most f(ℓ, L).The next lemma will be used several times later.Lemma 2.5. Let ℓ ≥ 2 and let L > ℓ. If a path P = v0 . . . vℓ is L-admissible, but not L-good,then there exist at least L pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length ℓ from v0 to vℓ.Proof. Take a maximal set of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length ℓ fromv0 to vℓ and assume that it consists of fewer than L paths. These paths contain at mostL(ℓ − 1) internal vertices in total and any path of length ℓ between v0 and vℓ intersectsat least one of these vertices. Since there are at least L5ℓL-admissible paths of length ℓbetween v0 and vℓ, it follows by pigeon hole that there exist some 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ − 1 and somex ∈ V (G) such that there are at least L5ℓ(ℓ−1)L(ℓ−1) L-admissible paths of the form u0u1 . . . uℓwith u0 = v0, ui = x, uℓ = vℓ. Observe thatL5ℓ(ℓ−1)L(ℓ−1) > L5iL5ℓ−i, so either there are morethan L5iL-good paths of length i between v0 and x or there are more than L5ℓ−i L-goodpaths of length ℓ − i between x and vℓ. In either case, we contradict the definition of anL-good path.Our strategy will be to prove that, roughly speaking, in any almost regular H-free graphthere are many good paths of length 2k. As we will see in Section 3, the techniques in [3]can be easily applied to prove this for paths of length k. The novelty of this paper is themachinery that allows us to extend this to longer paths, using very different techniques. Thisis given in Section 4, where we prove the following lemma.3Lemma 2.6. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum de-gree δ ≥ L100k |V (H)|, and let S ⊂ V (G). Then, provided that L is sufficiently large comparedto |V (H)| and K, |S| = ω( nδ1/2) and |S| = ω( nL1/2), the number of L-good paths of length 2kwith both endpoints in S is Ω( |S|2δ2kn ).Note that in this result and everywhere else in the paper, the asymptotic notation Ω allowsthe implied constant to depend on k, |V (H)| and K, which are thought of as constants, whileδ and L are functions of n.With Lemma 2.6 in hand, the proof of Theorem 2.2 is immediate.Proof of Theorem 2.2. Suppose that G does not contain H = F 2k−1 as a subgraph. Sinceδ = ω(n12k ), we may choose L with L = ω(1), L100k |V (H)| ≤ δ and n2f(2k, L) = o(nδ2k).Then we may apply Lemma 2.6 with S = V (G) to get that the number of L-good pathsof length 2k in G is Ω(nδ2k), which is ω(n2f(2k, L)). However, by the definition of L-goodness, between any two vertices there can be at most f(2k, L) such paths, which is acontradiction.The proof of Theorem 2.3 is slightly more complicated, and it uses ideas from [8].Proof of Theorem 2.3. Firstly note that F is a subgraph of Kt for some t, so it sufficesto prove the result for F = Kt. Let ε > 0 be sufficiently small, to be specified, and let G bea K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum degree δ = ω(n12k−ε). Assume thatG does not contain a copy of H = F 2k−1.For vertices u, v ∈ V (G), let us write u ∼ v if there is a path of length 2k between uand v. Also, let us say that u and v are distant if for every 1 ≤ i ≤ 4k − 2, the numberof walks of length i between u and v is at most δi−2k+1/2. Observe that for any u ∈ V (G)the number of walks of length i starting from u is at most (Kδ)i, so the number of verticesv ∈ V (G) for which there are at least δi−2k+1/2 walks of length i from u to v is at most(Kδ)iδi−2k+1/2= Kiδ2k−1/2. Thus, the number of v ∈ V (G) for which u and v are not distant isO(δ2k−1/2).Define c0 = ε and cℓ+1 = (3 · 52k + 1)cℓ + 2kε for 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t− 1. Assume that ε is smallenough so that3 · 100k|V (H)| · cℓ ≤12k− ε (1)for all 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t. Then in particular cℓ ≤14k − ε/2 holds for all 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t. For futurereference, note that thenncℓ ≤ n14k−ε/2 = o(δ1/2). (2)Claim. For any 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ t, there exist distinct vertices x1, . . . , xℓ ∈ V (G) and a set Sℓ ⊂ V (G)such that(i) there is a copy of K2k−1ℓ in G with the vertices of the subdivided Kℓ being x1, . . . , xℓ(ii) xi ∼ y for every 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ and every y ∈ Sℓ(iii) |Sℓ| = Ω(n1−cℓ) and(iv) xi and xj are distant for every 1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ.Note that in particular for ℓ = t, condition (i) guarantees the existence of a subgraphK2k−1t , so it suffices to prove the claim.Proof of Claim. We proceed by induction on ℓ. For ℓ = 0, we may take S0 = V (G). Assumenow that we have verified the claim for ℓ.4Suppose that for some y ∈ Sℓ there exist 1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ and two paths of length 2k, one(called Pi) from xi to y and one (called Pj) from xj to y, which share a vertex other than y.Let they intersect at some vertex z 6= y. Now let the subpath of Pi between xi and z havelength α and let the subpath of Pj between xj and z have length β. Then there is a walk oflength α+ β from xi to xj through z. Moreover, there is a path of length 2k − α from z toy. Observe that 2k − α ≤ 4k − (α+ β)− 1.Let Y be the set of y ∈ Sℓ for which there exist some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ and a walk W oflength γ ≤ 4k − 2 between xi and xj such that for some vertex w on W the distance of yfrom w is at most 4k− γ− 1. By condition (iv), there are at most δγ−2k+1/2 walks of lengthγ between any xi and xj so there are O(δγ−2k+1/2) vertices appearing in at least one of thesewalks. Therefore the number of vertices at distance at most 4k − γ − 1 from at least one ofthese vertices is O(δγ−2k+1/2 · δ4k−γ−1) = O(δ2k−1/2). That is, |Y | = O(δ2k−1/2).Notice that by the discussion above, for any y ∈ Sℓ \\ Y and any i 6= j, a path of length2k from xi to y, and a path of length 2k from xj to y have no common vertex other thany. Thus, by condition (ii) there exist ℓ paths of length 2k, one from each xi to y which arepairwise vertex-disjoint apart from at y. Moreover, these paths are also vertex-disjoint fromthe paths forming the K2k−1ℓ guaranteed by condition (i), apart from the trivial intersectionsat x1, . . . , xℓ (else, there is a path of length at most 2k − 1 from y to a point on a path oflength 2k between some xi and xj , which contradicts the fact that y 6∈ Y ). Thus, for anyy ∈ Sℓ \\ Y there is a copy of K2k−1ℓ+1 in G with the vertices of the subdivided Kℓ+1 beingx1, . . . , xℓ, y.Let Z be the set of z ∈ Sℓ which are not distant to xi for at least one 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ. By thesecond paragraph in this proof, |Z| = O(δ2k−1/2).Let S′ℓ = Sℓ \\ (Y ∪ Z). Recall that |Y | = O(δ2k−1/2). Note that if δ = ω(n12k ), then,by Theorem 2.2, G contains H as a subgraph, so we may assume that δ = O(n12k ). Thenδ2k−1/2 = O( nδ1/2), which is o(n1−cℓ) by equation (2). Thus, |Y ∪ Z| = o(n1−cℓ) and so|S′ℓ| = Ω(n1−cℓ).Let L = n3cℓ. Then, by equation (1), we have L100k |V (H)| ≤ n12k−ε = o(δ). Moreover, byequation (2), we have n1−cℓ = ω( nδ1/2), and by the definition of L, we have n1−cℓ = ω( nL1/2).Hence, by Lemma 2.6, the number of L-good paths of length 2k with both endpoints in S′ℓ isΩ(|S′ℓ|2δ2kn ). Between any two vertices in S′ℓ there are at most f(2k, L) L-good paths of length2k, so the number of pairs (z, y) ∈ S′ℓ×S′ℓ with z ∼ y is Ω(|S′ℓ|2δ2knf(2k,L)). Thus, there exists somexℓ+1 ∈ S′ℓ such that the number of y ∈ S′ℓ with xℓ+1 ∼ y is Ω(|S′ℓ|δ2knf(2k,L)) ≥ Ω(n1−cℓ−2kεL52k) =Ω(n1−cℓ−2kε−3cℓ52k) = Ω(n1−cℓ+1). Set Sℓ+1 to be the set of these y ∈ S′ℓ, and note thatproperties (i)-(iv) are satisfied for ℓ+ 1.3 Short pathsOur aim in this section is to prove the following lemma.Lemma 3.1. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum de-gree δ ≥ L100k|V (H)|. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to |V (H)| and K,the number of paths of length k that are not good is O(nδkL ).The proof of this is almost identical to that of Lemma 6.4 in [3], nevertheless we includeit here for completeness and since some minor details need to be modified.The next definition is for notational convenience.Definition 3.2. A pair of distinct vertices (x, y) in G is said to be (ℓ, L)-bad for some2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k and some L if there is an L-admissible, but not L-good, path of length ℓ from xto y.5In what follows, for v ∈ V (G), we shall write Γi(v) for the set of vertices u ∈ V (G) forwhich there exists a path of length i from v to u and write N(v) = Γ1(v). The next lemmais a slight variant of Lemma 6.7 from [3].Lemma 3.3. Let 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ. Let G be a K-almost-regular graph on n verticeswith minimum degree δ > 0. Let X,Y,Z ⊂ V (G) be such that |Z| ≤ L1/10, |Y | ≤ (Kδ)ℓ−1and, for any x ∈ X, the number of y ∈ Y such that (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad is as at least (Kδ)ℓ−1f(ℓ−1,L)2.Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to k and K, there exist a path of length2i in G, disjoint from Z, whose endpoints form a set R ⊂ Y , and a subset X ′ ⊂ X such that|X ′| ≥ |X \\ Z|/(16f(ℓ − 1, L)2) and (x′, r) is (ℓ, L)-bad for every x′ ∈ X ′ and r ∈ R.Proof. After replacing X by X \\ Z, we may assume X ∩ Z = ∅. Let Y ′ be the set of thosey ∈ Y for which the number of x ∈ X such that (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad is at least |X|2f(ℓ−1,L)2. Thenthe number of (x, y) ∈ X × (Y \\ Y ′) which are (ℓ, L)-bad is at most |X||Y |2f(ℓ−1,L)2≤ |X|(Kδ)ℓ−12f(ℓ−1,L)2,so the number of (x, y) ∈ X × Y ′ which are (ℓ, L)-bad is at least |X|(Kδ)ℓ−12f(ℓ−1,L)2. Now thereexists some x∗ ∈ X such that there are at least (Kδ)ℓ−12f(ℓ−1,L)2choices y ∈ Y ′ for which (x∗, y)is (ℓ, L)-bad. If a pair (x∗, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad, then there are at least f(ℓ, L) paths of lengthℓ from x∗ to y. Hence, there are at least (Kδ)ℓ−12f(ℓ−1,L)2· f(ℓ, L) = Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3δℓ−1) paths oflength ℓ starting at x∗ and ending in Y ′.The number of such paths intersecting Z is at most |Z|ℓ(Kδ)ℓ−1. Indeed, there are atmost |Z| choices for the element of Z in the path, at most ℓ choices for its position in the pathand, given a fixed choice for these, at most (Kδ)ℓ−1 choices for the other ℓ−1 vertices in thepath. (Note that asX∩Z = ∅, the vertex in Z is not x∗.) But |Z|ℓ(Kδ)ℓ−1 ≤ L1/10ℓKℓ−1δℓ−1,so, for L sufficiently large there are Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3δℓ−1) paths of length ℓ starting at x∗ andending in Y ′ that avoid Z. Moreover, since |Γℓ−i(x∗)| ≤ (Kδ)ℓ−i, it follows that there existssome u ∈ Γℓ−i(x∗) such that there are Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3δi−1) paths of length i from u to Y ′, allavoiding Z.Take now a maximal set of such paths which are pairwise vertex-disjoint apart fromat u. We claim that there are Ω(f(ℓ− 1, L)3) such paths. Suppose otherwise. Then all theΩ(f(ℓ−1, L)3δi−1) paths of length i from u to Y ′ intersect a certain set of size o(f(ℓ−1, L)3)not containing u. But there are o(f(ℓ− 1, L)3)δi−1 such paths, which is a contradiction.So we have r = Ω(f(ℓ−1, L)3) paths P1, . . . , Pr of length i from u to Y′ which are pairwisevertex-disjoint except at u and avoid Z. Let the endpoints of these paths be y1, . . . , yr.Since yj ∈ Y′ for all j, the number of pairs (x, yj) with x ∈ X which are (ℓ, L)-bad is atleast r|X|2f(ℓ−1,L)2 . Therefore, by Jensen’s inequality, for an average x ∈ X there are at least(r/(2f(ℓ−1,L)2)2)choices 1 ≤ j1 < j2 ≤ r such that both (x, yj1) and (x, yj2) are (ℓ, L)-bad.Since(r/(2f(ℓ−1,L)2)2)≥ ( 14f(ℓ−1,L)2)2(r2), there exist 1 ≤ j1 < j2 ≤ r such that the setX ′ = {x ∈ X : (x, yj1) and (x, yj2) are (ℓ, L)-bad}has size at least |X|/(4f(ℓ− 1, L)2)2. We can now take R = {yj1 , yj2}, and the union of thepaths Pj1 and Pj2 is a suitable path of length 2i.The following lemma is a small modification of Lemma 6.8 from [3].Lemma 3.4. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum de-gree δ ≥ L100k |V (H)|. Let 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and any v ∈ V (G). Then, provided that L is sufficientlylarge compared to |V (H)| and K, the number of L-admissible, but not L-good, paths of theform v0vv2v3 . . . vℓ is at most2(Kδ)ℓf(ℓ−1,L) .6Proof. Suppose otherwise. Let Y = Γℓ−1(v) and note that |Y | ≤ (Kδ)ℓ−1. For any x ∈ N(v)and any y ∈ Y , the number of L-admissible paths of the form xvv2 . . . vℓ−1y is at mostf(ℓ − 1, L). Indeed, in any such path, the subpath vv2v3 . . . vℓ−1y is L-good, and for anyfixed y ∈ Y there are at most f(ℓ − 1, L) such L-good paths. Hence, by assumption, thenumber of pairs (x, y) ∈ N(v)× Y such that there is an L-admissible, but not L-good, pathof the form xvv1 . . . vℓ−1y is at least2(Kδ)ℓf(ℓ−1,L)2≥ 2|N(v)|(Kδ)l−1f(ℓ−1,L)2. By definition, any such pair(x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad. Let X consist of those x ∈ N(v) for which there are at least (Kδ)ℓ−1f(ℓ−1,L)2choices of y ∈ Y such that (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad. Then the number of pairs (x, y) ∈ X × Ywhich are (ℓ, L)-bad is at least |N(v)|(Kδ)ℓ−1f(ℓ−1,L)2 , and so |X| ≥|N(v)|f(ℓ−1,L)2 ≥δf(ℓ−1,L)2 .Our aim now is to find a copy of H in G, which will yield a contradiction. Write k = jℓ+iwith 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ.Note that if L is sufficiently large, then|X| ≥δf(ℓ− 1, L)2≥L100k |V (H)|f(ℓ− 1, L)2≥f(ℓ− 1, L)20|V (H)|f(ℓ− 1, L)2≥ 2L(16f(ℓ− 1, L)2)2|V (H)|,so we may apply Lemma 3.3 repeatedly |E(F )|+ |V (H)| ≤ 2|V (H)| times and still get a setX ′ of size at least L. Thus, we find disjoint paths Pe of length 2i for every e ∈ E(F ) whoseendpoint sets are Re ⊂ Y , and sets Xfinal ⊂ X and U ⊂ Y with |Xfinal| = |U | = |V (H)|such that V (Pe),Xfinal and U are pairwise disjoint and any pair (x, y) with x ∈ Xfinal andy ∈ U∪⋃e∈E(F )Re is (ℓ, L)-bad. For e ∈ E(F ), let ye−kye−k+1 . . . yek be the path of length 2kreplacing the edge e.A copy of H in G can now be constructed as follows. For each e ∈ E(F ), map the pathye−iye−i+1 . . . yei to Pe. Then map, for each e ∈ E(F ), the vertices yei+ℓ, ye−(i+ℓ) to Xfinal inan arbitrary injective manner. Also, map each yei+2ℓ , ye−(i+2ℓ) to U in an arbitrary injectivemanner. More generally, map the vertices yei+aℓ, ye−(i+aℓ) with a ≥ 1 odd to Xfinal in anarbitrary injective manner and map the vertices yei+aℓ, ye−(i+aℓ) with a ≥ 2 even to U in anarbitrary injective manner. We then just need to find paths of length ℓ connecting yei+aℓ andyei+(a+1)ℓ (and paths of length ℓ connecting ye−(i+aℓ) and ye−(i+(a+1)ℓ)) which are disjoint fromeach other and from the images of the already mapped vertices. Since (x, y) is (ℓ, L)-bad forevery x ∈ Xfinal and y ∈ U ∪⋃e∈E(F )Re, such paths exist by Lemma 2.5, provided that L issufficiently large.Corollary 3.5. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimumdegree δ ≥ L100k |V (H)|. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to |V (H)| andK, for any 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, the number of L-admissible, but not L-good, paths of length ℓ is atmost n 2(Kδ)ℓf(ℓ−1,L) .Now we are in a position to prove Lemma 3.1.Proof of Lemma 3.1. Suppose that the path u0u1 . . . uk is not L-good. Take 0 ≤ i <j ≤ k with j − i minimal such that uiui+1 . . . uj is not L-good. Then ui . . . uj is L-admissible. For any fixed i, j, by Corollary 3.5, the number of such paths is at mostn 2(Kδ)j−if(j−i−1,L) · 2(Kδ)k−(j−i) = 4Kk nδkf(j−i−1,L) ≤ 4Kk nδkL . Using that i and j can take atmost k+1 values each, it follows that the number of not L-good paths of length k is at most(k + 1)24Kk · nδkL .4 Long pathsIn what follows, for a vertex x ∈ V (G) and a nonnegative integer i, we write Pi(x) for theset of directed paths of length i starting at x. For an element P ∈ Pi(x), we let v(P ) be theendpoint of the path P .7Definition 4.1. Let i, j be nonnegative integers with i + j < 2k. Call a pair (x, y) ofdistinct vertices (i, j)-rich if the number of pairs (P,Q) ∈ Pi(x)×Pj(y) such that there areat least (|V (H)|+2)(2k+1)+1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length 2k− i− jbetween v(P ) and v(Q) is more than (2(i+j)|V (H)|(2k+1)+2(i+1)j)(Kδ)i+j−1 . Otherwise(including when x = y) call it (i, j)-poor.Lemma 4.2. Let G be a graph with maximum degree at most Kδ. Let x, y ∈ V (G) and leti, j be nonnegative integers with i + j < 2k. If (x, y) is (i, j)-rich, then there exist |V (H)|pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length 2k between x and y.Proof. Choose a maximal set of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths R1, . . . , Rα betweenx and y and assume that α < |V (H)|. Let T be the set of the vertices appearing in at leastone of these paths. Note that |T | < |V (H)|(2k + 1).Claim. If there is a pair (P,Q) ∈ Pi(x)× Pj(y) such that(i) P is disjoint from T \\ {x}(ii) Q is disjoint from T \\ {y}(iii) P and Q are vertex-disjoint and(iv) there are at least (|V (H)|+ 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths oflength 2k − i− j between v(P ) and v(Q),then there is a path of length 2k between x and y which is internally vertex-disjoint from allof R1, . . . , Rα.Proof of Claim. Clearly, it suffices to find a path of length 2k− i− j between v(P ) and v(Q)which is disjoint from the vertices of R1, . . . , Rα, P,Q, except for v(P ) and v(Q). But sucha path exists since there are at most (α + 2) · (2k + 1) ≤ (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) vertices inone of R1, . . . , Rα, P,Q and there are at least (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internallyvertex-disjoint paths of length 2k − i− j between v(P ) and v(Q).A path provided by the claim would contradict the maximality of R1, . . . , Rα, so it sufficesto prove that there are paths P,Q satisfying (i)-(iv) above.Since the maximum degree of G is at most Kδ, the number of paths of length i − 1in G intersecting T is at most i|T |(Kδ)i−1, so the number of P ∈ Pi(x) which have avertex in T \\ {x} is at most 2i|T |(Kδ)i−1. Since |Pj(y)| ≤ (Kδ)j , the number of pairs(P,Q) ∈ Pi(x) × Pj(y) failing condition (i) above is at most 2i|T |(Kδ)i−1(Kδ)j . Similarly,the number of pairs failing (ii) is at most 2j|T |(Kδ)j−1(Kδ)i. Finally, for every P ∈ Pi(x),the number of paths of length j − 1 which intersect P is at most (i + 1)j(Kδ)j−1, so thenumber of pairs (P,Q) ∈ Pi(x)×Pj(y) for which P and Q share a vertex other than y is atmost (Kδ)i · 2(i+1)j(Kδ)j−1. So the number of pairs which fail at least one of (i),(ii),(iii) isat most (2(i+ j)|T |+ 2(i+ 1)j)(Kδ)i+j−1 ≤ (2(i+ j)|V (H)|(2k + 1) + 2(i+ 1)j)(Kδ)i+j−1.By the definition of (i, j)-richness of (x, y) it follows that there is a pair (P,Q) satisfying(i)-(iv).Definition 4.3. For a vertex v ∈ V (G) and some 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, define an auxiliary graphGℓ(v) as follows. The vertices of Gℓ(v) are the (k+1)-tuples (u0, u1, . . . , uk) ∈ V (G)k+1 withu0 = v such that uiui+1 ∈ E(G) for all i. Vertices (u0, . . . , uk) and (u′0, . . . , u′k) are joined byan edge if v, u1, u2, . . . , uk, u′1, . . . , u′k are distinct and there exist 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1 such thatthe pair (uℓ, u′ℓ) is (i, j)-rich. Since the vertex set of Gℓ(v) does not depend on ℓ, we maydefine G(v) to be the union⋃1≤ℓ≤k Gℓ(v).8Lemma 4.4. Let G be a graph with maximum degree at most Kδ which does not contain Has a subgraph. Let t = |V (F )|. Then for any v ∈ V (G) and any 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, the graph Gℓ(v)is Kt-free.Moreover, let r = Rk(t) be the k-colour Ramsey number. Then G(v) is Kr-free.Proof. Suppose that Gℓ(v) contains Kt as a subgraph. Let the corresponding vertices be thevectors u1, . . . , ut. Let their respective (ℓ + 1)th coordinate be u1ℓ , . . . , utℓ. For every a 6= b,since uaub is an edge in Gℓ(v), it follows that uaℓ and ubℓ are distinct, and, by Lemma 4.2,there exist |V (H)| pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length 2k between them. It isnot hard to see that this implies that there is a copy of H in G in which the vertices of Fare mapped to u1ℓ , . . . , utℓ. This is a contradiction, so Gℓ(v) is indeed Kt-free.Suppose there is a copy of Kr in G(v). Then each edge in this Kr can be coloured withone of the colours 1, 2, . . . , k such that if an edge gets colour i, then it lies in Gi(v). By thedefinition of r, there exists a monochromatic Kt in this k-edge-coloured Kr, which gives aKt in some Gℓ(v), contradicting the first paragraph.The next lemma provides us a large set of walks of length 2k with both endpoints in S.Later, we will argue that most of them are L-good paths.Lemma 4.5. Let r = Rk(t) denote the k-colour Ramsey number where t = |V (F )|. Let Gbe an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum degree δ and let S ⊂ V (G)such that |S| ≥ 2nr/δk. Then there are at least |S|2δ2k4r2nvectors (u−k, . . . , uk) ∈ V (G)2k+1with the following properties(i) u−k ∈ S, uk ∈ S(ii) uℓuℓ+1 ∈ E(G) for every −k ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1(iii) (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor for every 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and every 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1.Proof. Since the minimum degree of G is δ, the number of (k + 1)-tuples (v0, v1, . . . , vk) ∈V (G)k+1 with vk ∈ S and vivi+1 ∈ E(G) for every 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 is at least |S|δk. WritingT (v0) for the set of such vectors for a fixed v0 and letting g(v0) = |T (v0)|, we get that∑v0∈V (G)g(v0) ≥ |S|δk. Note that∑v0∈V (G):g(v0)<rg(v0) ≤ nr ≤|S|δk2 , so∑v0∈V (G):g(v0)≥rg(v0) ≥|S|δk2. (3)Note that T (v0) ⊂ V (G(v0)). By Lemma 4.4, the graph G(v0)[T (v0)] is Kr-free. This graphhas g(v0) vertices, so if g(v0) ≥ r, then the number of non-edges in G(v0)[T (v0)] is at least1(r2)(g(v0)2)≥ g(v0)2r2. But if v = (v0, v1, . . . , vk) ∈ T (v0) and v′ = (v0, v′1, . . . , v′k) ∈ T (v0) aresuch that vv′ is not an edge in G(v0), then (u−k, . . . , uk) = (v′k, v′k−1, . . . , v′1, v0, v1, . . . , vk)satisfies all three properties in the statement of the lemma. Therefore the number of such(2k + 1)-tuples with u0 = v0 is at leastg(v0)2r2provided that g(v0) ≥ r. By (3) and Jensen’sinequality, we get∑v0∈V (G):g(v0)≥rg(v0)2r2≥ |S|2δ2k4r2n, and the proof is complete.The following simple lemma shows that most walks of length 2k are paths.Lemma 4.6. Let G be a graph on n vertices with maximum degree at most Kδ. Then thenumber of (2k+1)-tuples (u−k, . . . , uk) ∈ V (G)2k+1 such that uiui+1 ∈ E(G) for every i andui = uj for some i 6= j is at most(2k+12)K2k−1 · nδ2k−1.9Proof. There are(2k+12)ways to choose the pair {i, j} and there are n ways to chooseui = uj. Given any such choices, there are at most (Kδ)2k−1 ways to choose the vertices ubfor b 6∈ {i, j} since any vertex in G has degree at most Kδ.Our strategy now is to take all the paths guaranteed by Lemmas 4.5 and 4.6 and discardthose which contain a subpath of length k which is not L-good. The next result shows thatdoing this we discard only a small proportion of the paths.Lemma 4.7. Let G be an H-free K-almost-regular graph on n vertices with minimum degreeδ ≥ L100k |V (H)|. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to |V (H)| and K, thenumber of paths u−ku−k+1 . . . uk of length 2k in G with the property that there is some−k ≤ j ≤ 0 for which the path ujuj+1 . . . uj+k is not L-good is O(nδ2kL ).Proof. By Lemma 3.1, there are O(nδkL ) paths ujuj+1 . . . uj+k which are not L-good, andsince the maximum degree of G is at most Kδ, there are at most 2(Kδ)k ways to extendsuch a path to a path u−ku−k+1 . . . uk of length 2k. The result follows after summing theseterms for all −k ≤ j ≤ 0.The next lemma is the first step to relate the notion of L-goodness with the notion of(i, j)-richness.Lemma 4.8. Suppose that u−ku−k+1 . . . uk is a path in G which is not L-good but each ofits subpaths of length k is L-good. Then, provided that L is sufficiently large compared to|V (H)|, there exist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α+β > k such that there exist (|V (H)|+2)(2k+1)+1pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length α+ β between u−α and uβ .Proof. Choose −k ≤ i < j ≤ k with j − i minimal such that uiui+1 . . . uj is not L-good.By the minimality of j − i, every proper subpath of uiui+1 . . . uj is L-good, so uiui+1 . . . ujis L-admissible. By Lemma 2.5, there exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internallyvertex-disjoint paths of length j − i between ui and uj.By the assumption that every subpath of u−ku−k+1 . . . uk of length k is good, we havej − i > k, so i < 0 and j > 0. Thus, the choices α = −i and β = j satisfy the conditionsdescribed in the lemma.The next result is the final ingredient to the proof of Lemma 2.6.Lemma 4.9. Let G be a graph on n vertices with maximum degree at most Kδ. Then thereare O(nδ2k−1) paths u−ku−k+1 . . . uk in G with the following two properties(i) (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor for every 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and every 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1 and(ii) there exist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α+ β > k such that there exist (|V (H)|+ 2)(2k + 1) + 1pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length α+ β between u−α and uβ.Proof. Fix a pair (α, β) with 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k and α + β > k. It suffices to prove that thenumber of paths satisfying (i) and (ii) for this pair (α, β) is O(nδ2k−1).Let ℓ = α+β−k. Note that 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k. Also, let i = α− ℓ = k−β and j = β− ℓ = k−α.Observe that 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1.Suppose that u−ℓu−ℓ+1 . . . uℓ is a path such that (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor. By the definitionof (i, j)-poorness, the number of pairs of paths (u−ℓu−ℓ−1 . . . u−α, uℓuℓ+1 . . . uβ) such thatthere exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths of length α +β = 2k − i − j between u−α and uβ is O(δi+j−1). Thus, the number of ways to extendu−ℓu−ℓ+1 . . . uℓ to a path u−ku−k+1 . . . uk possessing property (ii) with our fixed choice of αand β is O(δi+j−1 · (Kδ)k−α+k−β) = O(δ2k−2ℓ−1), where the first factor bounds the number10of possible ways to extend to u−αu−α+1 . . . uβ, and the second factor bounds the numberof possible ways to extend that to u−ku−k+1 . . . uk. The number of possible choices foru−ℓu−ℓ+1 . . . uℓ is O(nδ2ℓ), so the result follows.We are now in a position to complete the proof of Lemma 2.6.Proof of Lemma 2.6. The condition |S| = ω( nδ1/2) implies that nδ2k−1 = o( |S|2δ2kn ), so byLemmas 4.5 and 4.6, there are Ω( |S|2δ2kn ) paths u−ku−k+1 . . . uk with both endpoints in Ssuch that (u−ℓ, uℓ) is (i, j)-poor for every 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k and every 0 ≤ i, j ≤ k − 1. Discard allthose paths among these in which there is a subpath of length k which is not L-good. ByLemma 4.7, we discarded O(nδ2kL ) paths, which is o(|S|2δ2kn ), by the condition |S| = ω(nL1/2).Of the remaining paths, discard all those for which there exist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α+ β > ksuch that there exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths oflength α+β between u−α and uβ. By Lemma 4.9, there are O(nδ2k−1) such paths, which isagain o( |S|2δ2kn ). Hence, we are left with Ω(|S|2δ2kn ) paths.We claim that each such path is L-good. Suppose otherwise, and take a path u−ku−k+1 . . . ukwhich is not L-good. Since each of its subpaths of length k is L-good, by Lemma 4.8 thereexist 1 ≤ α, β ≤ k with α + β > k such that there exist (|V (H)| + 2)(2k + 1) + 1 pairwiseinternally vertex-disjoint paths of length α+β between u−α and uβ . But we discarded thesepaths, which is a contradiction, and the proof is complete.References[1] N. Alon, M. Krivelevich, and B. Sudakov.

Matter in neutron star collisions can reach densities up to few times the nuclear saturationthreshold (ρ0 ' 2.7×1014 g cm−3) and temperatures up to one hundred MeV. Understanding the structureand composition of such matter requires many-body nonperturbative calculations that are currently highlyuncertain. Unique constraints on the neutron star matter are provided by gravitational-wave observationsaided by numerical relativity simulations. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical conditions ofmatter and radiation along the merger dynamics. We consider 3 microphysical equation of state modelsand numerical relativity simulations including an approximate neutrino transport scheme. The neutronstar cores collision and their multiple centrifugal bounces heat the initially cold matter to several tens ofMeV. Streams of hot matter with initial densities ∼ 1−2ρ0 move outwards and cool due to decompressionand neutrino emission. The merger can result in a neutron star remnant with densities up to 3− 5ρ0 andtemperatures ∼ 50 MeV. The highest temperatures are confined in an approximately spherical annulusat densities ∼ ρ0. Such temperatures favour positron-neutron capture at densities ∼ ρ0, thus leading toa neutrino emission dominated by electron antineutrinos. We study the impact of trapped neutrinos onthe remnant matter’s pressure, electron fraction and temperature and find that it has a negligible effect.Disks around neutron star or black hole remnant are neutron rich and not isentropic, but they differ insize, entropy and lepton fraction depending on the nature of the central object. In presence of a black hole,disks are smaller and mostly transparent to neutrinos; in presence of a massive neutron star, they are moremassive, geometrically and optically thick.PACS. 04.25.D numerical relativity – 04.30.Db gravitational wave generation and sources – 95.30.Sfrelativity and gravitation – 95.30.Lz Hydrodynamics – 97.60.Jd Neutron stars1 IntroductionSimulation in numerical relativity (NR) predict that theoutcome of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers on dynam-ical timescales is the prompt formation of a black hole viagravitational collapse or of a remnant neutron star (NS)[1]. In the latter case, the cold, β-equilibrated matter ofthe individual NSs at typical densities 1 of ρNS ∼ 2− 3ρ0is pushed to ρ ∼ 5 − 6ρ0 and temperatures up to T ∼50 − 100 MeV in the remnant (see e.g. [2,3,4]). Thoseextreme conditions are reached on a timescale of millisec-onds, and potentially differ from those of proto NS in su-pernova remnants (e.g. [5]).Our knowledge of the properties of cold matter atsupranuclear densities are still affected by large uncertain-ties, see e.g. [6,7]. Nevertheless they are key in determin-Send offprint requests to: albino.perego@unitn.it1 We consider here NSs of “fiducial” mass of MNS ∼ 1.35 −1.4 M\f.ing the internal structure and mass-radius relation of NSs.Despite many theoretical effords, also the behavior of nu-clear matter at finite temperature is poorly known, seee.g. [8] and references therein. The first composition- andtemperature-dependent versions of the equation of state(EOS) widely used in simulations of binary NS mergersand core-collapse supernovae were the Lattimer-Swesty(LS) EOS [9] and the Shen EOS [10]. Most of the EOScurrently used and compatible with present nuclear con-straints are based on the relativistic mean field (RMF)approach [8]. However, more realistic EOSs based on de-tailed microscopic interactions and many-body techniquesare becoming available, e.g. [11].A detailed knowledge of the matter interactions in themerger remnant is pivotal for characterizing the dynamicsand the related gravitational and electromagnetic radia-tion signatures. For example, tidal interactions during theinspiral are parametrized by NS compactness and EOS-dependent tidal polarizability coefficients [12,13,14,15,16,17]; the properties of the merger dynamics dependent pri-arXiv:1903.07898v1  [gr-qc]  19 Mar 20192 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergersmarily on those coefficients [18,19]. Moreover, the maxi-mum mass of nonrotating NS supported by the EOS deter-mines the threshold for the prompt gravitational collapseof the remnant [20,21]. Similarly, the EOS characterizesthe remnant NS, the disk, the ejecta, and the neutrinoemission properties (e.g. [22,4]), thus influencing the nu-cleosynthesis and ultimately the properties of the kilonovaemission [4,23]. The timescale for the gravitational col-lapse to a black hole, as well as the mass and the lifetimeof the disk, can also play a pivotal role in launching a rel-ativistic jet and producing a (short) gamma-ray burst,see e.g. [24,25,26,27]. The appearance of phase transi-tions and extra degrees of freedom, including hyperonsand quarks, can soften the EOS in the merger remnantleading to collapse and/or signatures in the gravitationalwaves (GWs) signal [2,28,29,30].NR simulations are the only means to build modelsand to interpret the observations that set constraints onthe NS properties and thus on the EOS. The measurementof tidal polarizability parameters in the GW170817 signalconstrained the EOS at ρ . ρNS, e.g. [31,32,33,34]. NRsimulations support the development of tidal waveformmodels for such measurement, e.g. [35,17,36,37,38]. Sim-ilarly, the post-merger signal from the remnant, althoughnot detected in GW170817 [39], could also place strongconstraints on the physics at extreme densities ρ . 5−6ρ0[40,41,42,28,43,44].Simulations results combined with the ejecta proper-ties inferred from AT2017gfo (the kilonova associated withGW170817) led to upper bounds on the maximum massof NS by noticing that the energy of the ejecta inferredfrom optical and infrared data are likely incompatible withboth a prompt collapse and a long lived remnant [45] (seealso [46,47,48]). Similar arguments, combined with em-pirical relations between NS radii and the threshold massfor prompt collapse mentioned above, tentatively rule outEOSs predicting very small NS radii [49]. The correlationbetween the disk mass and the tidal polarizability param-eter observed in NR simulations can complement the con-straints on the tidal coefficients in joint observation of GWand electromagnetic (EM) radiation [22,50].In this work we study in details the thermodynami-cal conditions of matter and radiation during binary NS(BNS) mergers. We explore three microphysical EOS mod-els by simulating the matter flow along the general rela-tivistic merger dynamics and including weak interactions.Our work aims at quantitatively investigating the typicaldensities, temperatures, and electron fractions that can bereached in real astrophysical mergers and their intrinsicvariability. We also explore the properties and the poten-tial role of a gas of dynamically trapped neutrinos deepinside the merger remnant. We finally point out the ro-bust features and some of the main uncertainties of cur-rent state-of-art simulations.The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 wepresent the EOSs employed in this work, the NR simu-lations setups, and the method used for the analysis ofthe neutrino trapped components. Section 3 is devoted tothe presentation of the thermodynamical conditions expe-rienced by the astrophysical plasma as obtained by severalBNS merger models, characterized by different EOSs, NSmasses and physical ingredients (e.g. turbulent viscosity).In Section 4 we report the results of the analysis of therole of trapped neutrinos, while in Section 5 we discussthe properties of disks in BNS merger remnants. Finally,we conclude in Section 6.2 MethodWe consider three different nuclear EOS models: HS(DD2)[53,54], LS220 [9], and HS(SFHo) [55], see Tab. 1 (in thefollowing, we will refer to the first and third ones simply asDD2 and SFHo, respectively). The LS220 EOS is based ona liquid droplet Skyrme model with a value of 220 MeV forthe modulus of the nuclear incompressibility. It includessurface effects and models α-particles as an ideal, classi-cal, non-relativistic gas. Heavy nuclei are treated using theso-called single nucleus approximation (SNA). The DD2and SFHo EOSs combine a statistical ensemble of sev-eral thousands of nuclei, under the assumption of nuclearstatistical equilibrium (NSE), with a RMF approach forthe unbound nucleons to treat high-density nuclear mat-ter [54]. The phase transition from nuclei to homogeneousnuclear matter at densities close to nuclear saturation den-sity is achieved by an excluded volume mechanism. DD2and SFHo use different parameterizations and values formodeling the mean-field nuclear interactions. In partic-ular, DD2 uses a linear, but density dependent coupling[53], while the RMF parametrization of SFHo is motivatedby neutron star radius measurements from low-mass X-raybinaries ([55] and references therein).All three models have symmetry energies at saturationdensity within experimental bounds. LS220 has a signifi-cantly steeper density dependence of its symmetry energythan the other models. In all models, the finite temper-ature behavior of the EOS is mainly determined by thenucleon effective mass, m∗N , with smaller effective massesleading to higher temperatures for constant entropy. TheLS220 EOS assumes that the nucleon mass is the barenucleon mass at all densities, while SFHo has m∗N/mN =0.76 at saturation density, and DD2 has m∗N/mN = 0.56,where mN is the bare nucleon mass.These EOSs predict NS maximum masses and radiiwithin the range allowed by "Bakgrunden för denna studie är problematiken kring beslutsfattande.

current astrophysical con-straints, including the recent LIGO-Virgo constraint ontidal deformability [31,32,34,33]. SFHo, LS220, and DD2support 2.06, 2.06, and 2.42 M\f cold, non-rotating max-imum NS masses. The cold, non-rotating NS radius cor-responding to 1.4 M\f is R1.4 = 11.9, 12.7, 13.2 km re-spectively. Since NS radii correlate with the pressure atroughly twice saturation density [6], we refer to EOS hav-ing smaller R1.4 as being “softer” and to EOS havinglarger R1.4 as being stiffer.

The EOS used for the initialdata are constructed from the minimum temperature slice(T ∼ 0.5 − 0.1 MeV) of the EOS table used for the evo-lution assuming neutrino-less beta-equilibrium. To createthe initial data tables we also subtract from the pressurethe contribution of photon radiation, which dominates atthe lowest densities due to the assumption of constanttemperature. Initial data properties are summarized inTab. 2.The initial data are evolved according to Einstein’sgeneral relativistic equations for the spacetime in the (3+1)Dform described in [57,58] and coupled to general rela-tivistic hydrodynamics. The (3+1)D simulations span themerger and the remnant evolution for a timescale of atleast 20-30 ms. We use the WhiskyTHC code [59,36,60,61];all the technical details are given in [23]. All simulationsinvolving the LS220 EOS and simulation DD2 M136136are reported here for the first time. All our simulations do-main covers a cube of 3,024 km in diameter whose center isat the center of mass of the binary. Our code uses Berger-Oliger conservative adaptive mesh refinement (AMR; [62])with sub-cycling in time and refluxing [63,64] as providedby the Carpet module of the Einstein Toolkit [65]. Wesetup an AMR grid structure with 7 refinement levels. Thefinest refinement level covers both NSs during the inspi-ral and the remnant after the merger, and has a typicalresolution of h ' 185 m.For a subset of binaries, we use the general-relativisticlarge eddy simulations method (GRLES; [66]) to explorethe impact of subgrid-scale turbulent angular momentumtransport. The turbulent viscosity is parametrized as σT =`mixcs, where cs is the sound speed, and `mix is a free pa-rameter that sets the intensity of the turbulence. In thecontext of accretion disk theory turbulent viscosity is usu-ally expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant α re-lated to `mix through the relation `mix = α csΩ−1, whereΩ is the angular velocity of the fluid [67]. Recently, veryhigh resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynam-ics simulations of a NS merger were reported by [68], whoused sufficiently high seed magnetic fields (1015 G) to re-solve the MRI in the merger remnant. Averaged α valuesfor different rest-mass density shells were also provided.In our models, we combine values of cs and Ω directlyobtained during the simulations with their estimate of αto compute `mix as a function of density.The high temperatures reached during the merger leadto the copious production of neutrinos of all flavors. Elec-tron (anti)neutrino production rates due to electron andpositron captures on free protons and neutrons, respec-tively, are characterized by a T 5 dependence on mattertemperature (e.g., [69]). Thermal processes producing allkinds of neutrinos have an even stronger dependence,∼ T 7(e.g., [70]). For densities in excess of ρlim ∼ 1012g cm−3and temperatures above a few MeV, the neutrino meanfree path becomes smaller than the typical length scalesof the system, and the diffusion timescale significantly ex-ceeds the dynamical timescales. Under these conditions,neutrino trapping occurs and neutrinos form a gas ther-mally and dynamically coupled with the baryonic fluid.Diffusing neutrinos are eventually emitted at the last scat-tering surface (also called neutrino surface), located at adensity close to ρlim, and propagate further in opticallythin conditions.The compositional and energy changes in the matterdue to weak reactions during the simulations are treatedusing a leakage scheme that tracks reactions involving elec-tron νe and anti-electron type ν¯e neutrinos separately [71,72]. Heavy-lepton neutrinos are treated as a single effectivespecies labeled as νx. The reactions included in the simula-tions are listed in Tab. 3; the precise formulas implementedfor neutrino production and absorption rates and for scat-tering opacities can be found in the references listed there.The total neutrino opacities are used to compute an es-timate to the optical depth following the scheme of [73].4 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergersTable 3. Weak reaction rates and references for their imple-mentation. We use the following notation: ν ∈ {νe, ν¯e, νx}denotes a neutrino species, νx any heavy-lepton neutrinos,N ∈ {n, p} denotes a nucleon, and A denotes a nucleus.Reaction Ref.νe + n↔ p+ e− [78]ν¯e + p↔ n+ e+ [78]e+ + e− → ν + ν¯ [74]γ + γ → ν + ν¯ [74]N +N → ν + ν¯ +N +N [79]ν +N → ν +N [74]ν +A→ ν +A [80]The optical depth and local opacity are then employedto calculate the neutrino diffusion timescale, as describedin [74,4]. The neutrino emission rate from optically thickregions is then computed as the ratio between the localneutrino densities and the diffusion timescale. For the for-mer quantity, we assume that the neutrinos follow Fermi-Dirac distributions with chemical potentials obtained as-suming beta-equilibrium with thermalized neutrinos as in[69]. Free-streaming neutrinos are emitted at an averageenergy and then evolved according to the M0 scheme in-troduced in [72,4]. The M0 scheme is less sophisticatedthat the frequency-integrated M1 scheme adopted by oth-ers [75,76]. However, it is has the advantage of computa-tional efficiency, it incorporates an approximate treatmentof gravitational and Doppler effects, and is well adapted tothe geometry found in NS mergers. In particular, it is notaffected by the well-known radiation shock artifact thatplagues the M1 scheme [77].2.1 Modelling of trapped neutrinosDespite the fact that trapped neutrino density is employedto compute emission rates from optically thick regions,the neutrino treatment adopted in our simulations doesnot explicitly model the presence of a trapped component.The temperature- and composition-dependent weak equi-librium that establishes between the baryonic and leptonicfluids for ρ & ρlim could potentially change the matterproperties at those densities. For example, we presentlyneglects the pressure and internal energy contributions,as well as possible changes in the electron fraction, due tothe presence of these neutrino gases.In order to explore this effect and to assess its rele-vance, we postprocess the results of our simulations bycomputing the thermodynamical conditions of the fluid inpresence of a neutrino gas in weak and thermal equilib-rium. For consistency with the underlying simulations, weconsider (anti)neutrino of all flavors modelled as three in-dependent species: νe, ν¯e, and νx. Since neutral currentreactions involving νx-ν¯x pairs decouple at significantlylarger densities than charged current reactions involvingνe and ν¯e, we distinguish between ρlim,e = 5× 1011g cm−3for both νe and ν¯e, and ρlim,x = 5 × 1012g cm−3 for νx.2 We first promote the electron fraction and the internalenergy density obtained by the simulations and measuredin the local comoving frame to the lepton and total (i.e.,fluid+neutrinos) internal energy density:Ye,sim → Ylesim → u .Indeed, the leakage scheme prescriptions evolve the leptonfraction and total internal energy, rather than the electronfraction and the fluid internal energy (see, e.g., [81]). For agiven matter density ρ, the electron fraction and the fluidenergy obtained in the simulations univocally identify atemperature through the EOS, Tsim. We then computethe electron fraction and the temperature at equilibrium,(Ye,eq, Teq) , solving the following set of equations:Yl = Ye,eq + Yνe(Ye,eq, Teq)− Yν¯e(Ye,eq, Teq) (1)u = e(Ye,eq, Teq) +ρmb[Zνe(Ye,eq, Teq)++ Zν¯e(Ye,eq, Teq) + 4Zνx(Teq)] (2)0 = ηνe(Ye,eq, Teq)− ηe(Ye,eq, Teq) +−ηp(Ye,eq, Teq) + ηn(Ye,eq, Teq) . (3)In the previous equations, Yνi and Zνi represent theneutrino particle and energy fractions, respectively, whileηi = µi/T is the degeneracy parameter for the i species.They are computed assuming weak and thermal equilib-rium between all the modelled species. The former is en-sured by the equilibrium relationship between the rela-tivistic chemical potentials µ, i.e. µνe = µe+µp−µn. Thelatter is given by the assumption that the neutrino andmatter temperature coincide. In particular, we computeYνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =4pimbρ(hc)3(kBT )3F2(ηνi) exp(−ρlim,iρ)(4)Zνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =4pimbρ(hc)3(kBT )4F3(ηνi) exp(−ρlim,iρ)(5)where Fk(x) is the Fermi function of order k, and we fur-ther assume that µν¯e = −µνe and µνx = 0. The densitydependent exponential term ensures that trapped neutri-nos are only present for ρ & ρlim (see e.g. [82]). Trappedneutrinos do provide a pressure as an ultra-relativistic gas,i.e. Pν = (ρZν)/(3mb). We thus compare the pressure ob-tained in the simulation,Psim ≡ Pfluid(ρ, Ye,sim, Tsim) , (6)with the total pressure at equilibrium,Peq ≡ Pfluid(ρ, Ye,eq, Teq) ++ρ3(Zνe + Zν¯e + 4Zνx) (Ye,eq, Teq) . (7)3 Thermodynamical evolutionWe now discuss results for the four fiducial binary neu-tron star mergers reported in Tab. 2. The binaries have2 Note that we do not include the presence of a scatteringatmosphere, which could be relevant for νx neutrinos.Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 5Fig. 1.

Peak temperatures correspond the first bounce of the NS cores, and are reached at typical densitiesρ ∼ ρ0. Collapse to black hole happens for LS220 M135135 and SFHo M135135; during collapse the maximum density reaches(max ρ) & 5ρ0.masses and EOS compatible with GW170817 [31] and, cor-respondingly, the maximal densities in each NS are 2− 3times the nuclear saturation point, ρNS1,2 ∼ 2− 3ρ0, withsofter EOS having larger maximum densities.The maximum density and temperature evolutions foreach model are reported in Fig. 1. The moment t = 0 cor-responds to the peak of the gravitational-wave amplitude(i.e. the end of the chirp signal) and it is conventionallyrefereed as moment of merger (or shortly merger, where itcannot be confused with the merger-phase of the coales-cence) [17]. During the last orbits (t < 0) the maximumdensity and temperature are approximately constant, thelatter being T ∼ 10 MeV. These high temperature arereached close to the surface of the stars and are a numer-ical artifact.At t ∼ 0 the two NS cores merge, the maximum den-sity increases rapidly up to ∼ 1.5ρNS and temperature in-creases due to (physical) hydrodynamical shocks and mat-ter compression. In the considered binaries, no promptcollapse happens and the two NS cores bounce multipletimes on a timescale of few milliseconds. During the firstof these bounces, the temperature peaks at 70− 100 MeVand most of the dynamical ejecta is expelled [83,84,4]. Thecore bounces are more violent in binaries with softer EOS,and produce larger density and temperature oscillations.Note that binary remnants are closer to the gravitationalcollapse instability point for softer EOSs [1,85,86]. Hotmaterial from the collisional interface between the NSs issqueezed out of the remnant and settles into an accretiondisk [4]. The remnant is still deformed into a bar (m = 2mode) and spiral arms are launched inside the disk. Ona timescale of 10 − 20 ms, the characteristic timescale ofthe GW transient, binaries with softer EOS collapse toa rotating black hole with typical dimensionless Kerr pa-rameter of ∼ 0.7 − 0.8 [3,19]. Binaries with stiffer EOSgenerate long-lived NS remnants whose dynamics is de-termined on timescales much longer than those presentlysimulated in numerical relativity [23].Let us discuss the thermodynamical conditions expe-rienced by the matter during the different phases of themerger. For the moment, we do not include the effect oftrapped neutrinos at ρ > ρlim, but we simply consider theoutcome of our simulations. Under the assumption thatmatter is always in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE),we focus on matter density, ρ, temperature, T , and elec-tron fraction, Ye. We consider 3D spatial hypersurfaces atspecific coordinate times and produce histograms of thebaryonic-mass as distributed at different ρ, T , and Ye, i.e.Mb(ρ, T, Ye). We used the following ranges:ρ ∈ [104, 1016] g cm−3T ∈ [10−2, 102] MeVYe ∈ [0, 0.5] ,binning them in 120 × 50 × 50 intervals. For the densityand temperature, the bins are uniformly displaced in thelogarithm, while we use a linear scale for the electron frac-tion. The artificial atmosphere of the simulations is set todensity level ρatm ∼ 104 g cm−3. Similar plots have beenpresented in [87,88] for core-collapse supernova simula-tions, in [29,89] for BNS mergers, and in [90] for BNSmerger aftermath 3. However, a detailed discussion is, tothe best of our knowledge, missing in the literature.3 Note the LS220 simulations presented here are a longer andhigher resolution versions of those shown in [89].6 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergersThe five rows of Figs. 2-6 4 refer to snapshots coveringthe entire available binary evolution. Moving from top tobottom: (1) early time during the orbital phase, (2) thetime corresponding to the temperature peak, (3) about3-4 milliseconds after the temperature peak, (4) a latertime close to collapse (if collapse happens), (5) time closeto simulation end. Each row shows a snapshot of rest-mass density on the orbital plane and two thermodynam-ical condition histograms in which two of three variables((ρ, T ) and (ρ, Ye), respectively) are shown and the thirdis integrated over its range.During the last orbits (snapshots (1)) most of the baryonmass is clearly distributed around the maximum NS densi-ties at T ∼ 1−3 MeV, with an electron fraction still closeto the cold, ν-less weak equilibrium, 0.01 . Ye . 0.12. Inall models we recognize the typical increase of Ye movingfrom ρ ∼ ρ0 to a few times ρ0 due to the increase in thesymmetry energy. The highest temperatures are reachedat densities ρ ∼ 1012g cm−3, but as mentioned above thisis a numerical artifact.After merger (t & 0, snaphshots (2)), the innermostpart of the merging cores, ρ & ρNS, does not experienceviolent shocks (s . 1 kB baryon−1, where s is the spe-cific matter entropy). Thus the increase of the maximumdensity in the center of the remnant is associated with amarginal increase in the temperature (up to a few tensof MeV), mainy due to matter compression of degeneratenuclear matter well above nuclear saturation density. In-deed, most of the matter in the cores resides below thesemi-degenerate transition line represented byT = TF(ρ) =~22mb(3pi2ρmb)2/3, (8)where TF is the Fermi temperature of an ideal baryon gasof mass mb. At merger (t ∼ 0) the electron fraction at thehighest densities is still frozen to the initial ν-less, coldweak equilibrium value. Due to the high opacities of theseregions during and after the merger, Ye does not changesignificantly on the simulated timescale due to the emis-sion of neutrinos. Only later, when the cores experience asignificant compression and mixing, the Ye profiles becomemore uniform for ρ & ρNS.On the contrary, the densities at which T peaks cor-respond to the regions close to the binary center of masswhere shocks are generated and material is pushed out-wards (snaphshots (2)-(3)). The highest temperatures arereached at densities slightly below ρNS and characterizedby the lowest Ye. In particular, the DD2 model peaks at∼ 70 MeV, LS220 at ∼ 80 MeV, and SFHo at ∼ 100 MeV.This matter, initially located in the outer layers of the twocores, expands into the spiral arms. The temperature low-ers as the spiral-arms expand and decompress, forming anenvelope around the merging cores. As a consequence ofthe fast expansion, the temperature drops to ∼ 10 MeVas the density reaches a few times 1013 g cm−3 (snapshot4 Time-dependent (animated) versions can be found athttp://www.computational-relativity.org/.(3)). The EOS is dominated by the non-degenerate nu-cleons (T & TF) and the matter expanding adiabaticallysatisfies the relation T 3/ρ2 ≈ const 5.In terms of the spatial distribution of ρ and T , themerging cores have a peculiar structure with two rotat-ing hot spots, displaced by an angle of ∼ pi/2 with re-spect to the densest regions corresponding to the NS cores(e.g. [91]). The expansion of the spiral arms, in combi-nation with their fast orbital motion, produces a diskstructure around the forming massive NS. The fast mo-tion of the merging cores and of spiral arms inside thisnewly formed envelope heats it up, mainly via shocks.The subsequent increase of entropy determines a spreadin the ρ− T diagram. The EOS is dominated by the non-relativistic baryons, T ∝ (exp (2s)/ρ2)1/3 (see, e.g., [92])and matter experiences a temperature increase up to afew tens of MeV (snapshots (3) and (4)). This behaviourexplains the peak structure and evolution observed in theρ − T diagram, where a maximum temperature of a sev-eral tens of MeV is reached by a substantial amount ofmatter with density around or immediately below nuclearsaturation density. The corresponding electron fraction issignificantly larger (∼ 0.05-0.10) than the low Ye expectedfrom ν-less, cold weak equilibrium (. 0.05). This is onlypartially due to an excess of electron antineutrinos emis-sion (see below), while it traces back the origin of thismatter to larger densities where the increase of the sym-metry energy produces larger Ye already in ν-less weakequilibrium conditions.Shocks inside the disk produce further matter expan-sion (snaphshots (3)-(5)). As soon as the density dropsbelow 1010g cm−3 and the temperature becomes of theorder of a few MeV, the EOS is dominated by the rela-tivistic electrons and photons. Thus, adiabatic expansionfollows the relation T 3/ρ ≈ const ∝ s, typical of ultrarel-ativistic gases.If the forming massive NS does not collapse (as inthe DD2 case, Fig. 2), the cores completely merge on atimescale of several ms and the hot spots become a spher-ical annulus at an intermediate density ∼ ρ0 between thedenser core and the more diluite envelope, see Fig. 8. Sincethis time interval corresponds to several orbital timescales,the envelope around the remnant has reached a relativelyhomogeneous configuration and the spread in the ρ − Tplane has significantly reduced. Moreover, an inspectionof the ρ−Ye planes reveals the effect of weak reactions onthe disk composition: at the location where the last scat-tering neutrino surface is expected to be (ρ ∼ ρlim), thecaptures of positrons and streaming νe on free neutronssignificantly increases the electron fraction.On the other hand, if a black hole forms (as in theLS220 and SFHo cases, see the fifth row of Figs. 3-6), theevolution of the thermodynamical conditions inside the5 Thermodynamics’ first principle for an adiabatic trasfor-mation of an ideal gas in a volume V is dU/V = +pdρ/ρ withU the internal energy and dU ∝ dT . For a non-relativisticgas P = 2/3 U/V and for a relativisitc gas P = 1/3 U/V .Hence, in the former case d lnT = 2/3 d ln ρ, and in the latterd lnT = 1/3 d ln ρ.Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 7remnant changes substantially. Within a ms, the forma-tion of an apparent horizon removes all the high densitypart of the system, down to densities of 1012g cm−3, leav-ing a rather cold disk (T . 10MeV) with a significantlyreprocessed electron fraction, i.e. Ye ∼ 0.25.In Fig. 7, we present histograms of the thermodynam-ical conditions from the third and fifth snaphshots for allthe models presented in Figs. 2-6, binned in density andspecific entropy, s. For the latter, we consider 50 logarith-mically spaced bins in the intervals ∈ [0.1, 100] kBbaryon−1.For all models, the cold unshocked cores are characterizedby the presence of low entropy material (s . 2 kBbaryon−1)for matter densities in excess of a few times ρ0. Mattersqueezed by the merging cores and expanding inside theforming disk is subjects to intense hydrodynamical shocksthat increase matter entropy up to a few kB baryon−1.The combined effect of matter expansion and shocks re-sulting from the repeated core bounces produces a tran-sient phase where the envelope engulfing the cores has alarge spread in entropy (see, for example, the left panel ofthe DD2 M136136 cases). However, on a timescale of a fewdynamical periods, the action of the spiral arms on the in-nermost part of the disk increases the entropy of the colderstreams, producing a tighter correlation between the mat-ter density and entropy. The bulk of the remnant outsidethe merging cores has 2 < s[kB baryon−1] . 10 for mat-ter density decreasing from 1014 down to 1010 g cm−3.Looking at the matter distribution inside this density in-terval, we conclude that softer EOSs present a remnantcharacterized by larger values of the entropy (i.e. ∆s ∼2 kBbaryon−1). This is a consequence of the stronger shocksthat characterize more violent mergers from more compactNSs. If the EOS is stiffer and the massive NS survives longenough, shock expansion inside the low density part of thedisk increases its entropy, up to 20 kBbaryon−1. On theother hand, if a black hole forms, the lack of a persistentsource of shocks partially prevents the disk from reachinga tight ρ−s correlation (as visible in the LS220 and SFHoequal mass cases).Apart from the differences due to the different fates ofthe remnant, all five fiducial models show a similar quali-tative behavior, and the major features described above donot depend on the specific EOS nor on the binary mass ra-tio. Nevertheless, quantitative differences and temporaryfeatures can be noticed depending on the specific model.Temperature and entropy are, on average, larger for mod-els employing a softer EOS. This is a results of the more vi-olent collision that characterize more compact NSs. Mod-els employing turbulent viscosity show immediately aftermerger a larger spread in the density-temperature his-togram, as well as in the density-entropy one. However,they require less time to produce disks with homogeneousproperties. In the asymmetric model LS220 M140120, thecores merge in a very asymmetric way. In particular, thecore of the lighter NS is tidally deformed by the core of theheavier one and its matter is subject to a violent tempera-ture increase during its decompression (see the second rawof Fig. 5). However, on a longer timescale, the outer partof the lighter core contributes to the formation of the hotenvelope around the merging cores and the evolution ofall termodynamical quantities resembles the one of moresymmetric mergers.Finally, it is interesting to note that our histogramstrack the evolution of the dynamical ejecta in its differ-ent components. Immediately after merger, a few ejec-tion episodes develops from matter with initially low tem-perature (a few MeV), low Ye (. 0.1), and low entropy(. 10kB). They expands very fast according to T 3/ρ2 ∼const, down to densities at the edge of our domain. Positronand electron neutrino captures on free n increase Ye dur-ing the expansion, but only marginally (Ye . 0.25). Wetentatively identify this ejecta as the tidal component. Af-ter ∼ 1 millisecond, ejection episodes are also visible fromthe high-temperature part of our histograms (correspond-ing to s & 10 kB baryon−1), expanding at the same rate.In the T − Ye plane, this ejecta presents a much broaderdistribution in Ye, up to Ye . 0.4. We identify this ejectaas the shock-driven one, whose polar component is moresignificantly influenced by neutrino absorption.4 Influence of neutrino trapping on matterWe now move to the discussion of the potential effect oftrapped neutrinos using the approached described in Sec-tion 2.1. We first re-write the expression of the neutrinofractions, Eqs. 4-5, in terms of the Fermi temperature,Eq. 8, neglecting the exponential cut in density:Yνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =3√28(TTF)3/2 (kBTmbc2)3/2F2(ηνi) , (9)Zνi(ρ, Ye, T ) =(kBTF3(ηνi)F2(ηνi))Yνi(ρ, Ye, T ) . (10)Since baryons are always non relativistic, kBT \u001c mbc2,significant neutrino fractions require high temepraturesfor matter in non-degenerate conditions (T \u001d TF) and/orhighly degenerate neutrino conditions (ην \u001d 1).We have repeated the analysis of the histrograms ofthe thermodynamical conditions presented in Section 3 in-cluding the effects of trapped neutrinos for ρ > ρlim. Sincethe variations in Ye and T are only minors (see below) andthe histograms present already a significant spread in allvariables, we conclude that the inclusion of trapped neutri-nos does not qualitatively changes our previous analysis.In Fig. 9 we present the results of our post-processinganalysis for a snapshot of the DD2 M136136 simulationtaken ∼ 11 ms after merger (i.e. close to the peak tem-perature) along the equatorial plane. In the top panels,we show the rest-mass density (left), matter temperature(middle) and electron fraction (right) as obtained by thesimulation. In the bottom panels, we present Yνe (left),Yν¯e (middle), and Ye,sim − Ye,eq = Yνe − Yν¯e (right) asobtained in our post-processing analysis.Deep inside the remnant, where densities are in ex-cess of a few times nuclear saturation density, ρ & 3ρ0,8 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergersthe temperature is a few MeV high. Under such condi-tions, T \u001c TF (i.e. µi \u001d T for neutrons, protons, andelectrons, and thermal effects are negligible). Since mat-ter conditions are still close to the initial cold, ν-less, weakequilibrium, we find |ηνi | . 3, and F2(ηνi) . 20 (see e.g.[93], appendix). Thus, the production of electron flavor(anti)neutrinos is suppressed and Ye,eq ≈ Ye,sim. SinceYe . 0.1, neutrons are more degenerate than protons andany increase in temperature decreases more significantlyµp than µn. Thus, ηνe . 0. This effect is partially com-pensated by the increase of µe due to matter compression.Overall, we find that −3 . ηνe . −1, 10−6 . Yνe . 10−4,10−4 . Yν¯e . 10−3, and 10−6 . Yνx . 10−4, such thatYνe < Yνx < Yν¯e locally.At lower densities, 1014g cm−3 . ρ . 4× 1014g cm−3,the temperature increases up to a few tens of MeV, dueto the presence of the hot annulus outside the mergingcores. While the electrons are still highly degenerate, theneutrons and (more significantly) the less abundant pro-tons becomes mildy degenerate (T & TF). The (negative)chemical potential of electron neutrinos decreases, but notthe neutrino degeneracy parameter, due to the higher tem-peratures: in this region we find that −2 . ηνe . −1. Un-der these conditions, a significant electron antineutrino gasforms Yν¯e ∼ 0.02, followed by Yνx . 0.01, while electronneutrinos are still suppressed by degeneracy (Yνe . 10−3).Due to the dominant presence of ν¯e, the initial Ye,sim(∼ 0.06) increases by Yν¯e , i.e. Ye,eq ≈ Ye,sim + Yν¯e , toguarantee lepton number conservation.At densities below 1014g cm−3 the decrease in temper-ature related with matter expansion produces less signif-icant deviations from the initial cold ν-less weak equilib-rium and all neutrino fractions become negligible insidethe cold (T . 10 MeV), unshocked streams. In particular,ηνe & 1 and νe dominate over ν¯e. However, due to thelow temperatures, T < TF and Yνe ∼ 10−3. At the sametime, spiral arms moving inside this cold and less densematter produce shockes that heat-up matter at the arminterfaces. Inside these regions, temperatures in excess of10 MeV for matter that decompresses down to a few times1012g cm−3 (thus, T ∼ several TF) lead to ηνe ∼ −1, pro-ducing trapped neutrino gases with Yν¯e . 0.03, Yνx .0.01, and Yνe ∼ a few 10−3. As a results, Ye,eq increaseswith respect to Ye,sim.The appearance of a trapped neutrino gas is done atthe expences of the fluid internal energy, formed by rel-ativistic electrons, positrons, photons, and non-relativisticbaryons. Since thermodynamical stability requires ∂e/∂T >0, Teq < Tsim. In the top panel of Fig. 10 we present theratio between the fluid pressure after and before the post-processing for the same configuration presented in Fig. 9.The inclusion of trapped neutrinos reduces the tempera-ture down to ∼93% of the simulation value in the hottestregions of the systems. Neutrinos are intrinsecally ultra-relativistic and for them Pν ∝ Zν/3, while for a non-relativistic ideal gas P ∝ 2e/3. Thus, we expect that theirappearance decreases the total pressure and we quantifythe relative variation of the pressure to be . 0.04, in par-ticular where the equatorial plane intersects the hot an-nulus outside the merging cores (as visible in the bottompanel of Fig. 10). Based on these results, the internal en-ergy stored in the neutrino field is at most ∼8% of thefluid internal energy.Effects similar to the ones we have discussed for highdensity region (ρ & 1014g cm−3) in the equatorial planecan be seen along any vertical plane passing through thecenter. However, far from the equatorial plane, the annu-lus structure involves matter at slightly lower density forwhich the decrease in the pressure due to the presence oftrapped neutrinos is slightly more significant (Peq/Psim ∼0.94).We finally move to the analysis of trapped neutri-nos in the SFHo M135135 model. The former is charac-terized by larger maximum densities and temperatures,see Fig. 1, and by a quick collapse of the central mas-sive NS. Before black hole formation, results of the neu-trino post-processing analysis are qualitatively similar tothe DD2 M136136 case. Due to the larger temperaturesreached during the NS collisions, the proton degeneracydecrease is more pronunced and electron antineutrinoscan locally form a trapped gas with Yν¯e . 0.05, in par-ticular where the cores collide and at the interface be-tween the spiral arms and the forming disk. The variationof the local pressure to the appearance of neutrinos canreach 10% of the simulation pressure. However, these largetemperatures are reached only immediately after merger,while during most of the evolution and for the bulk of thematter, neutrino fractions are only marginally larger thanthe ones observed in the DD2 M136136 model. After theformation of an apparent horizon, the maximum densityand temperature significantly decrease inside the disk andtrapped neutrinos play no role inside the remnant.5 Disks around black holes or NS remnantThe analysis of the entropy distributions inside BNS mergerremnants already revealed important differences betweenthe case in which a black hole promptly forms and that inwhich a massive NS survives for several dynamical timescales (end of Section 3). Further differences in the diskproperties are clearly visible in Figs. 11-13, where we presentvolume rendering of the matter density, and three dimen-sional spatial distributions of entropy and electron frac-tion, for two simulations employing a stiffer (DD2 M136136,left panels) and a softer (SFHo M135135, right panels)EOS, a few tens of milliseconds after merger.The disk around the black hole produced at the endof the SFHo M135135 simulation is less massive and morecompact (i.e., with a significantly smaller spatial exten-sion and a steeper density profile) than the disk producedoutside the massive NS by the DD2 M136136 simulation.Maximum densities in the former case reach only∼ 1012 g cm−3in a torus around the innermost stable circular orbit. Onthe other hand, in the latter case the spatially more ex-tended disk has a continuously increasing density profilemoving towards the center that joins up with the massiveNS density structure. The resulting disk is geometricallyand optically thick to neutrinos (at least during the firstAlbino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 9tens of ms). Fig. 12 confirms that a softer EOS producesdisks with larger entropies (possibly, ∆s ∼ 2 kBbaryon−1) due to the stronger shocks that develop at and aftermerger. Neutrino irradiation from the center of the rem-nant changes the electron fraction above and inside thedisk. On the one hand, in both cases the innermost partof the disk retains its initial neutron richness, while theelectron fraction increases significantly above 0.3 in thelow density funnel above it. On the other hand, signifi-cant differences characterize Ye in the outer parts of thedisk. Due to the more extended, more diluite and colderstructure, the outer disk obtained in the DD2 run has alower electron fraction than the more compact disk result-ing from the SFHo run.6 Symmary and conclusionsIn this paper, we analyzed the thermodynamical condi-tions experienced by matter during the merger of two NSsbased on the results of detailed hydrodynamical simula-tions in numerical relativity. Our five fiducial models in-clude the effect of finite-temperature, composition depen-dent nuclear EOSs in tabular form and of the emission ofneutrinos via a three-species M0 that accounts for the re-absorption of electron flavor (anti)neutrinos in opticallythin conditions.We explored three different hadronic EOSs: DD2, SFHoand LS220. The first two are based on the RMF approachand on a full distribution of nuclei in NSE, while the latteris based on a liquid droplet Skyrme model and, besides freeneutrons and protons, includes α particles and one repre-sentative heavy nucleous. While most of our models referto equal mass binaries, in one case we have investigate thepotential impact of an asymmetric mass binary merger.Moreover, in three cases we have included the impact ofsubgrid-scale turbulent angular momentum transport us-ing the general-relativistic large eddy simulations method(GRLES; [66]).Matter stays cold and close to T = 0, ν-less weak equi-librium during the inspiral (the marginal increase of tem-perature at the NS surfaces is a numerical artifact). Assoon as the two NS cores touch and merge, the tempera-ture increases by up to several tens of MeV for densitiesimmediately above nuclear saturation density. This is dueto the development of hydrodynamical shockes at the in-terface between the bouncing cores that produce an hotmantle around the unshocked, merging bulks. The entropyin the cores stays below 2 kB baryon−1, while it increasesto a few kB baryon−1 in the hot mantle. The action ofrotating spiral arms on the forming disk increases tem-perature and entropy. At first, on a timescale comparablewith a few disk dynamical timescale, this produces a largespread in temperature and entropy. Later, over severaldisk orbits, the conditions becomes more homogeneous.Matter expansion from the merging cores follows T 3/ρ2profiles, typical of baryon-dominated matter that expandsadiabatically. The more compact and dense NS cores asso-ciated with softer EOS produce the largest densities andtemperatures. Asymmetric NS masses and the inclusionof turbulent viscosity have only a marginal impact on thethermodynamical properties.Since our simulations did not include the presence ofa trapped neutrino gas in thermal and weak equilibriumwith the fluid, we analyzed its potential impact in post-processing. We concluded that its inclusion can only marginallyaffect the local thermodynamical properties of dense mat-ter above 1012g cm−3: the maximum temperature is re-duced by . 10%, while the introduction of neutrinos de-termines a decrease in the total pressure . 5% and onlyin the hottest regions of the domain. Due to the initialneutron richness, deviations from cold, ν-less weak equi-librium due to an increase in temperature favor the pro-duction of electron antineutrinos over neutrinos.If according to our results the inclusion of trapped neu-trinos is not expected to significantly change the dynam-ical properties of the remnant, the appearance of addi-tional degrees of freedom such as hyperons and quarks fordensities well above ρ0 could have a more significant im-pact. BNS merger simulations performed with the BHBΛφEOS model [94] (which is identical to DD2 apart for theappearance of hyperons at ρ & 2ρ0) present a qualita-tively different evolution of the remnant (see, e.g., [28]).Hyperons in the BHBΛφ models soften the EOS and canlead to a fast collapse of the massive NS into a black hole,whereas identical initial conditions evolved with the DD2EOS produce a stable rotating NS. For merging NSs withMNS . 1.35M\f the appearance of hyperons is expectedonly after merger and mainly inside the cold, unshockedcores. If a black hole does not form, the qualitative be-havior of the thermodynamical conditions is expected tobe very similar to the DD2 case, even if the stronger corebounces related with the EOS softening produce a hot-ter remnant in the BHBΛφ than in the DD2 case. Onthe other hand, in more massive NSs hyperons could bepresent already during the inspiral phase and their frac-tion increases faster and more significantly during theearly post-merger phases. This can lead to hotter remnantdisks than the corresponding DD2 cases, if the massive NScollapse to a black hole.The possible appearance of muons (mµ ≈ 105.6 MeV)and mesons (e.g. pions, mpi ≈ 135−140 MeV) has been ex-plored, especially in cold NS matter, e.g. [95]. In this case,degeneracy drives their production at densities well aboveρ0. During a BNS merger, if the temperature reaches sev-eral tens of MeV in the hot envelope, they could alsobe thermally produced at densities around or below ρ0.Their inclusion in finite-temperature, composition depe-dent EOS is still missing and their potential impact onBNS mergers has not been explored yet.Our fiducial models allowed us to study the proper-ties of disk forming in a BNS merger. We found thatthe formation of a black hole in the center instead of amassive NS leads to the most significant differences. Inthe early BH formation case, the disk is usually hotter(due to the more violent NS collisions), more compact,and less dense (ρ . 1012g cm−3). However, the highertemperatures and neutrino luminosities change its elec-10 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergerstron fraction more significantly. In the case in which along-lived remnant is formed, the disk is geometricallyand optically thick, it is spatially more extended and hasless steep density gradients, due to the prolonged actionof the non-singular central object. Our post-processinganalysis of the trapped-neutrino gas could not directlyinvestigate if the electron fraction of the matter form-ing the disk is largely affected by the temporal transitionto finite-temperature weak equilibrium conditions beforequasi-adiabatic expansion. The reduced variation of Ye ob-served for ρ & 1012g cm−3 seems to imply that this is notthe case and more significant changes in Ye are expecteddue to the absorption of electrons and positrons, as weelas of νe and ν¯e on free baryons. This conclusions is qualita-tively consistent with results reported by BNS simulationsincluding the contributions of trapped neutrinos, e.g. [75,76].Finally, the histograms of the thermodynamical condi-tions reported in [87,88] for CCSN simulations allow a di-rect comparison between the thermodynamical conditionsinside CCSNe and BNS mergers. The electron fractionhas opposite trends inside these two scenarios. In CCSNe,symmetric nuclear matter deleptonizes to reach neutronrich conditions inside the forming proto NS. Cold, ν-lessweak equilibrium conditions are achieved only on the ν-cooling timescale (much larger than the dynamical and ex-plosion timescale). On the other hand, in BNS mergers thedecompression, heating, and neutrino irradiation of coldnuclear matter drive matter leptonization. This processis relevant to set the thermodynamical conditions of theejecta and, ultimately, its nucleosynthesis yields, e.g [90,96,97,75,72,98,99]. This fundamental difference reflectsalso on the evolution of the density-temperature condi-tions. In CCSN simulations the presence of a single shockfront between the proto NS and the cold accreting flowchannels most of the hot mantle in a rather narrow bandin the ρ − T plane. On the other hand, in BNS merg-ers the combined presence of hydrodynamical compres-sion, tidal decompression, shocks and expansion producesa much broader band that narrows over several dynamicaltimescales. In CCSNe larger densities and temperaturesare achieved for softer EOSs, but the mass of the pro-genitor star is the most crucial parameter that influences,for example, the maximum temperature reached duringthe simulation. Indeed, densities of the order of a few ρ0are reached only after the proto NS formation and cooling,and the details of the nuclear interactions are of secondaryimportance with respect to the strength of the gravita-tional field. In this work, we have only partially exploredthe dependence on the colliding NS masses and, in partic-ular, we did not consider very massive NSs. However, thedensities are significantly larger in NS mergers and the de-tails of the nuclear interactions influence more deeply thedynamics. Thus, the variability introduced by the differentEOSs in NS merger models is compatible with the vari-ability associated with different progenitors for CCSNe.We might expect more variability in mergers with largerNS masses, however prompt collapse to black hole sets anintrinsic limit to the densities reached in the remnant.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Domenico Logotetafor useful discussions.

Histograms of the baryonic mass in the density-entropy plane from the second (left), third (middle) and fifth (right)snapshots for all the five reference simulations reported in Table 2 and in Figs. 2-6. The unshocked cores of the NSs retaintheir initial low entropy, while shocked decompressed matter expanding towards lower densities experience a significant entropyincrease.Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 19Fig. 8. Temperature distribution (MeV) in the massive NSproduced by the DD2 M1361364 binary at t = 34.2ms afterthe merger. The surface of the massive NS is defined as thepoint where the rest mass density ρ exceeds 1013g cm−3. Mate-rial at lower densities is made transparent in this visualization.Massive NSs produced in binary mergers are rotationally com-pressed along the rotation axis (vertically in the figure). Hightemperatures are confined to a spherical annulus at intermedi-ate densities ∼1014g cm−3 formed of material originally at thecollisional interface between the NSs.20 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergersFig. 9. Upper row: Rest mass density (left), temperature (middle) and electron fraction (right) on the orbital plane for theDD2 M136136 model at the temperature peak, as obtained in simulation. Bottom row: electron neutrino fraction (Yνe , left),electron antineutrino fraction (Yν¯e , middle), variation of the electron fraction (Ye,sim − Ye,eq corresponding to Yνe − Yν¯e , right)after modelling in postoprocessing the presence of trapped neutrinos at high density. Inside the merging cores, matter degeneracyprevents neutrino formation (TF \u001d T ). Only for shocked matter in semi-degenerate conditions engulfing the cores or developingat spiral arm interfaces, a significant ν¯e fractions develops.Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 21Fig. 10. Upper (lower) panel: ratio of equilibrium temper-ature (pressure) to the one obtained in the simulation. Theequilibrium values are calculated in postprocessing includingthe effect of trapped neutrinos. The formation of trapped neu-trino gases converts fluid thermal energy into radiation energy,reducing matter temperature down to ∼92% of the simulationvalue. Since Pν ∝ Zν/3, the total pressure reduces down to∼94% of its original value.22 Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergersFig. 11. Volume rendering of the density of the postmerger remnant. Left panel: DD2 M13641364 at t = 34.2ms after themerger. Right panel: SFHo M135135 at t = 17.2ms after the merger. Both image have the same spatial scale and show the datain a box of size ∼750 km. The black surface denotes the approximate location of the black hole horizon, which we identify asα = 0.3, being α the lapse function. Remnants harboring black holes at their centers, such as SFHo M135135, produce smaller,compact disks, that are mostly transparent to neutrinos. Conversely, remnants having a massive NS at their center, have moremassive, geometrically and optically thick disks. At high latitudes, a low-density funnel is present in both cases.Fig. 12. Entropy in kB per baryon of the postmerger remnant. Left panel: DD2 M136136 at t = 34.2ms after the merger. Rightpanel: SFHo M135135 at t = 17.2ms after the merger. We only show material with ρ ≥ 1011 g cm−3 corresponding the innerregions of Fig. 11. Note that here we are using two different spatial scales for the two images (c.f., Fig. 11). The black surfacedenotes the approximate location of the black hole horizon, which we identify as α = 0.3, being α the lapse function. The coresof the merging NSs are not significantly shocked during merger, so the central part of the remnant maintains a relatively lowspecific entropy of s.2 kB. Material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the NSs forms the bulk of the disk andhas entropy of a few kB. In the cases in which black hole formation occurs, the disk entropy is slightly higher (by a couple ofkB) than in the cases in which a massive NS is still present at the center.Albino Perego et al.: Thermodynamics conditions of matter in neutron star mergers 23Fig. 13. Visualization of the electron fraction of the merger remnant. Left panel: DD2 M136136 at t = 34.2ms after the merger.Right panel: SFHo M135135 at t = 17.2ms after the merger. Both image have the same spatial scale as in Fig. 11 and show thedata in a box of size ∼750 km. The electron fraction is used to color the 107g cm−3 (semi-transparent), and the 1011g cm−3density iso-surfaces. We also show the electron fraction on the ρ = 1013g cm−3 iso-surface for the DD2 M13641364 model.The black surface denotes the approximate location of the black hole horizon, which we identify as α = 0.3, being α the lapsefunction. The accretion disks are fairly neutron rich in their bulk, irrespective of the remnant type (massive NS or black hole).The accretion disk coronae are irradiated by neutrinos and are less neutron rich."

Patients of group A (n = 16) had uncanceled AMI (Killip class 1) while patients ol group B (n = 15) had severe AMI (Killip class >_2). Finally, 10 age-matched volunteers were used as healthy controls. Result&\" Peaks of IL-6 and slL-6R levels ware not sigrMicantty different between the two groups ilL-6: group B 25.2 ± 4.7 vs group A 23 ± 4.3 I ~ 1  and slL-6R: group B 3.6 • 0.3 vs group A 3.9 • 0 6 noJml, p = NS) but ware signi{~cantty higher than the respectnm levels of healthy controls ilL-6:3.9 ± 0.5 pojmh p < 0.01; slL-6R: 1.7 ~: 0.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Furthermore, peaks of TNF-a and sTNFRI levels were signil¢.antly higher in group B than respective peaks ot cylokine levels in group A (TNF-a: group B 19.2 :~ 3.7 vs group A 6.2 :~ 1.7 pg/ml, p < 0.01; sTNFRI: group B 4.1 ~ 1.1 vs group A 2.9 ± 0.6 ng/ml, p < 0.01) and healthy controls (TNF-a: 3.5 • 1.1 Wml and sTNFRI: 1.9 • 0.1 ng/ml, p -~ 0.001). In group B regression analysis revealed that the peak of TNF-a levels significantly correlated with peak of sTNFRI levels (r = 0.60, p < 0.01), white blood cell counts (r = 0.50, p ~ 0.05), peak of serum CK MB isoenzyme (r = 0.67, p ,~ 0.01) and ejec,=on fra,.'tmn (r = -0.61, p - 0.01). In the same patients, the peak ol sTNFRt lev=ls was also significantly correlated with white blood cell counts (r = 0.60, p ~- 0.01), peak o1 serum CK MB isoenzyme (r = 0.63, p < 0.01) and ejection fraction (r = -0 .65,  p < 0.01). Finally, in group B, non survivors (n = 4) had significantly higher peaks of TNF-a and sTNFRI levels (both p < 0.05) than those of survivors (n = 11). Conclusions: These results suggest that proinflammafory cytokine serum activity increases substantially in the two catergories of AMI and TNF-a is a major cytokine which may be especially implicated in the pathophysiology of severe AMI. This cytokine and its soluble receptor closely correlated with AMI severity anci worsening prognosis and may be used as alternative prognostic indicators of severe AML Acute Myo~rdilill Infarction: SHOCK and Ventricular An'hythmlaa Monday, March 30, 1998, 3:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m, Georgia WodU Congress Center, west Exhibit Hall LevQI Presentation Hour: 4:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m. Ule ef In tm, lem:  ~ Ce.n t~q~ lu tkm ha HV.

A graph G = (V,E) is word-representable if there exists a wordw over the alphabet V such that letters x and y alternate in w if and onlyif xy is an edge in E. Word-representable graphs are the subject of a longresearch line in the literature, and they are the main focus in the recentlypublished book “Words and Graphs” by Kitaev and Lozin.

We show that each 132-representable graph is nec-essarily a circle graph. Also, we show that any tree and any cycle graph are132-representable.

We say that x and y alternate in w if after deleting in w allletters but the copies of x and y we either obtain a word xyxy · · · (of evenor odd length) or a word yxyx · · · (of even or odd length). For example, inthe word 23125413241362, the letters 2 and 3 alternate. So do the letters 5and 6, while the letters 1 and 3 do not alternate.A graph G = (V,E) is word-representable if there exists a word w overthe alphabet V such that letters x and y alternate in w if and only ifxy is an edge in E. For example, the graph to the right in Figure 2.3is word-representable and one of words representing it is bcdad. Somegraphs are word-representable, others are not, and the minimum non-word-representable graph is the wheel W5 shown to the left in Figure 2.2.Word-representable graphs are the subject of a long line of research in theliterature initiated in [7] by Kitaev and Pyatkin, and they are the main focusin the recently published book [6] by Kitaev and Lozin. A general programof research suggested in [6, p. 183] takes as the input a language defined, forexample, through pattern-avoiding words, and outputs a description of theclass of graphs represented by the language. For instance, as is discussedin [6, p. 183], the set of weakly increasing words (those avoiding the pattern21) defines graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and anindependent set, so that no edge connects the clique and the independentset.In this paper, we study graphs defined by 132-avoiding words. Ourresearch merges the theories of word-representable graphs [6] and patternsin words [2, 4], the latter being a very fast growing area. A word w =w1w2 · · ·wn avoids the pattern 132 (resp., 123) if there are no indices 1 ≤i1 < i2 < i3 ≤ n such that wi1 < wi3 < wi2 (resp., wi1 < wi2 < wi3). Wesay that a graph G is 132-representable (resp., 123-representable) if there isa 132-avoiding (resp., 123-avoiding) word representing it. Note that for thelast definition to make sense, labels of graphs are supposed to be taken froma totally ordered set. Also, when trying to 132-represent (123-represent) agraph, we are allowed to label the graph in any suitable way1.1There is no issue with labelling when considering word-representable graphs, since alllabelings are equally good or bad. However, in the contexts when there is an order onlabels, labelling graphs in a proper way may be essential for finding a representation.2132-representable graphscircle graphsword-representable graphsall graphs odd wheels W5, W7, . . . [7]prisms [5]disjoint union of 2 comp-lete graphs of size 4 [8]trees, cycle graphs,complete graphsFigure 1.1: The place of 132-representable graphs in a hierarchy of graphclassesOne of the main results in this paper is in showing that any 132-represent-able graph is necessarily a circle graph. A result in [8] shows that 132-representable graphs are a strict subset of circle graphs. Also, we showthat trees, cycle graphs and complete graphs are 132-representable. Thus,the place of 132-representable graphs in a hierarchy of graph classes is asshown in Figure 1.1, where we also indicate known facts that odd wheelsare non-word-representable [7], while prisms are word-representable but notcircle graphs [5]. Interestingly, the studies in [8] show that the class of123-representable graphs, being different from the class of 132-representablegraphs, is also a proper subclass of circle graphs, even though not all trees are123-representable; all cycle graphs and complete graphs are 123-representable.One should compare our results with the results on 12-representablegraphs obtained in [3]. These graphs are an instance of u-representablegraphs, a far reaching generalization of word-representable graphs, also in-troduced in [3], where u is a word over {1, 2} different from 22 · · · 2. Similarlyto the case of 132-representable graphs, labelling of graphs is important for12-representation. A word w 12-represents a graph G, if for any labels xand y, x < y, xy is an edge in G if and only if after removing all letters inw but x and y, we will obtain a word of the form yy · · · yxx · · ·x. Note thatthe notions of 132-representable graphs and 12-representable graphs are notdirectly related (in the former case the pattern is used to give a condition onwords representing graphs, while in the latter case the pattern is used to de-fine the representation itself). It was shown in [3] that any 12-representablegraph is necessarily a comparability graph, while very few trees (called dou-ble caterpillars) and almost no cycle graphs (only cycle graphs on at mostfour vertices) are 12-representable.3This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give necessary defini-tions, notation and results to be used in the paper. In Section 3 we derive akey property of words 132-representing graphs (see Theorem 3.4) and stateits corollary, the main result in this paper, that any 132-representable graphis necessarily a circle graph (see Corollary 3.5). In Section 4 we not only es-tablish 132-representability of trees and cycle graphs, but also describe andenumerate all 132-representants for complete graphs. Moreover, in Section 4we discuss non-132-representable graphs and give explicit 132-representationof graphs on four and five vertices. Finally, in Section 5 we state a numberof suggestions for further research.2 PreliminariesGraphs. We will now review a number of basic notions/notations in graphtheory. In this paper, we deal with simple graphs, that is, graphs with noloops and no multiple edges.The degree d(v) of a vertex v in a graph G is the number of edges ofG incident with v. The complete graph on n vertices is denoted by Kn. Acycle graph Cn is the graph on n vertices that consists of a single cycle. Awheel graph Wn is the graph on n+ 1 vertices obtained from Cn by addingan all-adjacent vertex (apex). The wheel graph W5 is shown to the left inFigure 2.2.A prism Prn is a graph consisting of two cycles 12 · · ·n and 1′2′ · · ·n′,where n ≥ 3, connected by the edges ii′ for i = 1, . . . , n. For example, Pr4,also known as the three-dimensional cube, is shown to the right in Figure 2.2.1′12′23′34′4Figure 2.2: The wheel graph W5 and the prism Pr4Finally, a circle graph is a graph whose vertices can be associated withchords of a circle such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if thecorresponding chords intersect. See Figure 2.3 for an example of a circle4graph.a bcd⇔c a dbFigure 2.3: A circle with four chords and the corresponding circle graphWords and permutations. For a finite word w, let A(w) denote the setof letters occurring in w, and red(w) denote the word over {1, 2, . . . , |A(w)|}obtained by replacing the i-th smallest letter(s) by i. We call red(w) thereduced form of w. Also, for any x ∈ A(w), let nw(x) denote the numberof copies of x in w, and xi denote the i-th occurrence of x in w from leftto right. For example, if w = 14661476212, then A(w) = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7},red(w) = 13441354212, and say for x = 6, nw(6) = 3. A word w is k-uniform if each letter in w occurs exactly k times.Suppose that x and y are two distinct letters in A(w). As is definedabove, we say that x and y alternate in w if after deleting in w all lettersbut the copies of x and y we either obtain a word xyxy · · · (of even or oddlength) or a word yxyx · · · (of even or odd length). In particular, if w has asingle occurrence of x and a single occurrence of y, then x and y alternatein w.A word or permutation w = w1w2 · · ·wn avoids the pattern 132 if thereare no indices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < i3 ≤ n such that wi1 < wi3 < wi2 . For example,the word 31458 avoids the pattern 132, while 3474 is not 132-avoiding (thesubsequence 374 in this word forms the pattern 132). It is a well-known fact(e.g. see [4, p. 32]) that the number of 132-avoiding permutations of lengthn is given by the n-th Catalan number cn =1n+1(2nn).A subword of w formed by consecutive letters is called a factor of w.For example, 6651 and 41 are factors of 26651141. Finally, we let [n] ={1, 2, . . . , n}.Word-representable graphs. A graph G = (V,E) is word-representableif there exists a word w over the alphabet A(w) = V such that x and yalternate in w if and only if xy ∈ E for each x ̸= y (that is, x and y areconnected by an edge). In this context, we say that w represents G and wis a word-representant for G.5In this paper we assume that elements in V come from a totally or-dered alphabet, which is important for the following definition. A word-representable graph G is 132-representable if, possibly after relabelling thegraph, there exists a 132-avoiding word w that represents G. In this context,w is called a 132-representant for G.For example, if w = 43451251, then the subword induced by the letters1 and 2 is 121, and hence the letters 1 and 2 alternate in w, so that therespective vertices are connected in G. On the other hand, the letters 1and 3 do not alternate in w, because removing all other letters we obtain311; thus, 1 and 3 are not connected in G. Figure 2.4 shows the graphrepresented by w. Moreover, since w is 132-avoiding, G is 132-representableand w is a 132-representant of G.5 31 24Figure 2.4: A 132-representable graph GWe note that labelling of a graph is important when dealing with 132-representation, which is not the case with just word-representation since alllabellings are equally good or bad. For example, the fact that the (unla-belled) graph A in Figure 2.5 is 132-representable is given by the labelledversion B of it and the 132-avoiding word 43212341. However, if we wouldlabel A to obtain the graph C in Figure 2.5, then no 132-avoiding represen-tation of it exists. Indeed, suppose that a 132-representant w for C exists.Then at least two letters in {1, 2, 3}, say x and y, x < y, must be repeatedat least twice in w, or else there would be at least one unwanted edge in{12, 13, 23}. Further, because 4 is an apex, there are x’s and y’s on bothsides of a 4 in w (the 4 must alternate with x and y), which leads to anoccurrence x4y of the pattern 132; contradiction.A.2143B.2413C.Figure 2.5: Significance of proper labellingThe following result is of special importance to us.6Theorem 2.1 ([1]). A graph G is word-representable and its representationrequires at most two copies of each letter if and only if G is a circle graph.Another relevant result is as follows.Theorem 2.2 ([5]). Prisms cannot be represented using at most two copiesof each letter, but can be represented using at most three copies of each letter.3 132-representantsIn this section, we discuss some properties of 132-representants.We first present a simple, but useful theorem.Theorem 3.1. Let G be a 132-representable graph, and x be a vertex inG such that d(x) ≥ 2. Then for any 132-representant w of G, we havenw(x) ≤ 2.Proof. Since d(x) ≥ 2, there exist vertices a and b, a > b, in G that areadjacent with x.Suppose that there are at least three copies of x in w. Then by thedefinition of a 132-representant, there exists a subsequence xw1xw2x in w,where for i = 1, 2, wi is a factor of w containing exactly one a, one b, and nox. There are three cases to consider, all of which contradict the requirementthat w is 132-avoiding:• x > a > b: bxa is a 132 pattern in w where b ∈ w1 and a ∈ w2;• a > b > x: xab is a 132 pattern in w where a ∈ w1 and b ∈ w2;• a > x > b: bax is a 132 pattern in w where b ∈ w1 and a ∈ w2.Hence, at most two copies of x can appear in w.As consequences of Theorem 3.1, we obtain the following results.Corollary 3.2. If each vertex in a graph G is of degree at least 2, then any132-representant for G is of length at most 2n.Corollary 3.3. Let w be a 132-representant for a graph G. If d(x) = 1 andthe vertex a connected to x has degree at least 2, then x occurs at most threetimes in w.7Proof. Let w denote a 132-representant for G. Since d(a) ≥ 2, by Theo-rem 3.1 a occurs at most twice in w. Combining with the fact that a and xalternate in w, we have that x occurs at most three times in w.The following theorem generalizes Theorem 3.1.Theorem 3.4. If a graph G is 132-representable, then there exists a 132-avoiding word w representing G such that for any letter x in w, nw(x) ≤ 2.Proof. Let w be a 132-representant for G. If all the vertices in G havedegree at least 2, then by Theorem 3.1 every letter appears in w at mosttwice. Hence it suffices to consider the case where there exists a vertex x inG such that d(x) = 1. Let a be the vertex connected to x. We consider twocases.• d(a) ≥ 2. By Corollary 3.3, the letter x occurs at most three timesin w. To prove the theorem, we assume that there are three copies ofx in w and then we will construct a new 132-avoiding word w′ whichalso represents G but contains only two copies of x. By Theorem 3.1,there are exactly two copies of a in w. In what follows, according toour notation, xi denotes the i-th x and aj the j-th a in w from left toright, where 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 2.Suppose that a > x. If there are no letters between the a’s exceptfor x then a is connected only to x in G; contradiction with d(a) ≥ 2.Thus there is a letter b ̸= x between a1 and a2 in w. If b > a > x,then x1ba2 will be the pattern 132; if a > b > x, then x1a1b will formthe pattern 132; if a > x > b, then ba2x3 will form the pattern 132; ineither case, there is a contradiction with the definition of w. Thus wemust have a < x.We next construct a new 132-avoiding word w′ from w. Since there isno element t smaller than a to the left of a1 in w (or else, tx2a2 wouldbe the 132-pattern), we obtain that a is a left-to-right minimum inw (that is, no letter to the left of a is less than a). We delete allthree x’s and replace a1 by the factor a+a1a+ to obtain the new wordw′, where a < a+ < a + 1. By construction of w′, if it contains anoccurrence of the pattern 132 then this occurrence cannot involve a+and thus it would give an occurrence of the pattern in w; contradiction.Moreover, a is the only letter in w′ alternating with a+, and thus w′132-represents G′ obtained from G by replacing the label x by a+.8• d(a) = 1, which means that the edge xa is disconnected from the restof the graph. Let w′ denote the word obtained from w by deleting aand x. Clearly, w′ is 132-avoiding. But then the 132-avoiding wordn(n− 1)n(n− 1)w′, where n and n− 1 are larger than any other letterin A(w′), represents the graph G′ obtained from G by replacing thelabels a and x by n and n− 1 (in any order).We can repeat the procedure described above for any other vertices of de-gree 1 in G to obtain the desired result.One of the main results in this paper is the following statement.Corollary 3.5. Any 132-representable graph is a circle graph.Proof. Let G be a 132-representable graph. By Theorem 3.4, there exists a132-representant w of G that contains at most two copies of each letter. ByTheorem 2.1 G is a circle graph.Note that we do not know whether each circle graph is 132-representableor not.4 132-representable graphsIn this section, we will show that trees, cycles, and complete graphs are132-representable.4.1 Trees and cycle graphsTheorem 4.1. Trees are 132-representable.Proof. We proceed by induction on the number of vertices with an additionalcondition. The tree with only one vertex can be represented by 1. Supposethat we can represent a tree with less than n vertices by a 132-avoidingword and the label of the root has only one occurrence and the label of thenon-root vertex has exactly two occurrences in the corresponding word.Given a tree T with n vertices, label it in pre-order, that is, starting fromthe root traverse the subtrees from left to right recursively. See the graph tothe left in Figure 4.6 for an example. Suppose that the root has r children,which means that T has r subtrees, whose roots are children of the root of9T . Denote the r trees by Ti for 1 ≤ i ≤ r from left to right and supposethat the root of Ti is labeled by ni. Note that 2 ≤ n1 < n2 < · · · < nr ≤ n,so that for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, Ti has ni+1 − ni vertices, where nr+1 = n + 1.Hence Ti is a tree having less than n vertices. By induction hypothesis,Ti is 132-representable and it can be represented by a 132-avoiding wordw(Ti) with only one copy of ni and two copies of any other letter. Letw = w(Tr)w(Tr−1) · · ·w(T1)1n1n2 · · ·nr. It is easy to see that w representsT , and in particular, the root labeled by 1 is only connected to its children.Moreover, since for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r the labels of Ti are smaller that the labelsof w(Tj), we get that w is 132-avoiding. We are done.Example 4.2. Let T be a tree as follows. It is clearly that T has threesubtrees T1, T2 and T3. By Theorem 4.1, there is w(T2) = 5. Moreover, wehave w(T1) = 43234 and w(T3) = 87678, which can be obtained by applyingthe inductive argument again. Hence w(T ) = 87678.5.43234.1256, wherethe dots showing parts of w(T ) should be ignored. It is obvious that w(T )is 132-avoiding and it represents T .12 5 63 4 7 8T⇒23 4T15T267 8T3Figure 4.6: A tree T of size 8 and its subtreesTheorem 4.3. Cycle graphs Cn are 132-representable.Proof. Let n ≥ 3. A path graph Pn (see Figure 4.7) is a tree, and, by theproof of Theorem 4.1, it can be represented by the 132-avoiding wordw = n(n− 1)n(n− 2)(n− 1)(n− 3)(n− 2) · · · 45342312.Let w′ be the word obtained from w by deleting the first n in w.

For n ≥ 1, a complete graph Kn is 132-representable. More-over, for n ≥ 3, there are2 + cn−2 +n∑i=0cidifferent 132-representants for Kn, where cn =1n+1(2nn)is the n-th Catalannumber. Finally, K1 can be represented by a word of the form 11 · · · 1 andK2 by a word of the form 1212 · · · (of even or odd length) or 2121 · · · (ofeven or odd length).Proof. Clearly, K1 can only be represented by a word of the form 11 · · · 1,and K2 can only be represented by a word of the form 1212 · · · (of evenor odd length) or 2121 · · · (of even or odd length). Each of these words is132-avoiding.Let n ≥ 3. Suppose that w is a 132-representant for Kn. According tothe definition of a complete graph, for any 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, we have that iand j alternate in w. Since d(n) ≥ 2, by Theorem 3.1, there are two casesto consider.Case 1. There are exactly two copies of n in w, and w = w1nw2nw3, wherewk is a word over [n − 1] for k = 1, 2, 3. Since for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, i and n11alternate in w, there is exactly 1 copy of i in w2, which means that w2 isin fact a permutation of length n − 1. Moreover, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, i mustnot appear in w1, or i, n, n− 1 will form the pattern 132. Thus, w1 = n− 1or w1 = ϵ, the empty word. Similarly, we have that w3 = 1 or w3 = ϵ.Thus, there are four subcases to consider and in each subcase, we just needto consider the form of w2.Subcase 1.1. w1 = n − 1 and w3 = 1. Thus 1 is to the left of n − 1in w2, since 1 and n − 1 alternate in w. For 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, i must bebetween 1 and n−1 in w2 since i alternates with 1 and n−1. Moreover, for2 ≤ i < j ≤ n−2, they are in increasing order in w2, or 1, j, i will form a 132pattern. Hence, we obtain that w = (n− 1)nw′1 where w′ is the increasingpermutation 12 · · ·n, and this case contributes one representation.Subcase 1.2. w1 = n− 1 and w3 = ϵ. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 2, i is to the left ofn− 1 in w2, since i and n− 1 alternate in w. Hence w = (n− 1)nw′(n− 1)nwhere w′ is any 132-avoiding permutation over [n − 2]. Thus, this casecontributes cn−2 representations.Subcase 1.3. w1 = ϵ and w3 = 1. Similarly to the Subcases 1.1 and 1.2,we obtain that w = nw′1 where w′ is the increasing permutation 12 · · ·n,and this case contributes one representation.Subcase 1.4. w1 = ϵ and w3 = ϵ. Here, w = nw2n where w2 is a 132-avoiding permutation over [n − 1]. Thus, this case contributes cn−1 repre-sentations.Case 2. There is only one copy of n in w. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n− 1, supposethat there are exactly two copies of i and j in w (by Theorem 3.1 there canbe at most two copies of each letter). Since Kn is a complete graph, we havethat n lies between i1 and i2 in w, and n also lies between j1 and j2 in w,where recall that, e.g. i1 and i2 denote the first and the second occurrencesof i, respectively, in the word. Then i1, n, j2 will form the pattern 132;contradiction. Using Theorem 3.1, there are two subcases to consider.Subcase 2.1. Every element in A(w) has only one occurrence in w. Thus, wis a 132-avoiding permutation over {1, 2, . . . , n}. Thus, this case contributescn representations.Subcase 2.2. There is only one letter i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1, in A(w) that occurstwice in w. Any letter in A(w) distinct from i must lie between i1 and i2in w. Since w is 132-avoiding, we obtain that w = i(i + 1) · · ·nw′i where12w′ is any 132-avoiding permutation over {1, 2, . . . , i − 1}. Thus, this casecontributes∑n−1i=1 ci−1 =∑n−2i=0 ci representations.By Theorem 4.5, the initial values for the number of 132-representantsfor Kn, starting from n = 3, are12, 27, 72, 213, 670, 2190, 7349, 25146, 87364, 307310, 1092200, 3915866, . . . .Example 4.6. For n = 3, we can see that all 12 132-representants for K3,ordered as in the proof of Theorem 4.5, are 231231; 23123; 31231; 3123,3213; 123, 231, 213, 312, 321; 1231, 2312.A direct corollary of Theorem 4.5 is the following statement.Corollary 4.7. For n ≥ 3 and a 132-representant w for Kn, the length ofw is either n, or n+ 1, or n+ 2, or n+ 3.4.3 Non-132-representable graphs and 132-representation ofsmall graphsEach non-word-representable graph is clearly non-132-representable. In thissubsection we will show that the minimum (with respect to the number ofvertices) non-word-representable graph, the wheel graph W5 given in Fig-ure 2.2, is actually a minimum non-132-representable graph. We do notknow whether there exist other non-132-representable graphs on six ver-tices (no other non-word-representable graphs on six vertices exist). As fornon-132-representable but word-representable graphs, an example of thoseis prisms Prn, where n ≥ 3. The latter follows from Theorems 2.2 and 3.4.We note that the complement of a 132-representable graph is not nec-essarily a 132-representable graph. Indeed, for example, the 132-avoidingword 6645342312 defines a 132-representable graph, which is disjoint unionof a cycle and the isolated vertex 6. However, the complement of this graphis the wheel graph W5, which is not word-representable.The following lemma allows us to restrict ourselves to considering graphswithout isolated vertices when studying 132-representation.Lemma 4.8. Let G be a graph and G′ be a graph obtained from G by addingan isolated vertex. Then G is 132-representable if and only if G′ is 132-representable.13Proof. If G′ is 132-represented by w then removing from w the letter corre-sponding to the isolated vertex we obtain a word 132-representing G.Conversely, suppose that G is 132-represented by w and n is larger thanany letter in w. Then we label the isolated vertex by n and note that theword nnw 132-represents G′.Lemma 4.8 cannot be generalized to adding to a graph a new connected132-representable component instead of an isolated vertex. This followsfrom the fact established in [8] that disjoint union of two complete graphsK4 is non-132-representable, while K4 is 132-representable. However, sucha generalization can be done in a special case as recorded in the followingsimple, but useful lemma.Lemma 4.9. Let G1, G2, . . . , Gk be connected components of a graph Gthat can be 132-represented by 2-uniform words w1, w2, . . . , wk, respectively.Then G is 132-representable (by a 2-uniform word).Proof. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, let ai = |A(wi)| denote the number of vertices in Gi,and let red∗(wi) denote the word obtained from red(wi) by replacing eachelement j, 1 ≤ j ≤ ai, by j +∑i−1m=1 am. Then the 2-uniform wordw = red∗(wk)red∗(wk−1) · · · red∗(w1)132-represents G.213443212321344342312324143421142334231213244324114231234123434341212Figure 4.9: 132-representants for graphs on four verticesBy Lemma 4.8, we exclude isolated vertices from our considerations inthe rest of this subsection. Moreover, graphs on up to three vertices areeither trees or the cycle graph C3, and thus they are 132-representable.14Further, there are seven graphs on four vertices which can be 132-representedas shown in Figure 4.9. Finally, there are 23 graphs on five vertices thathave no isolated vertices, and these graphs can be 132-represented as inFigure 4.10. Note that Lemma 4.9 was used (in a straightforward way)to 132-represent graphs in Figures 4.9 and 4.10 that have two connectedcomponents.2 45 13452341251 35 425123411 23 45543212 41 355453214 31 2554324513 54 1254325124 51 3254235212 31 455435211 23 4554532411 32 5454342512 13 4553423125 14 32345231251 32 4553453121 25 4354531214 15 3254345215 24 3154534214 13 2534231245151 25 43453423121 42 355434521214 35 2154543211 52 345453423121 42 355434523124 53 21543212345Figure 4.10: 132-representants for graphs on five vertices (with no isolatedvertices)5 Concluding remarksThis paper just scratches the surface of a big research direction dealingwith representing graphs by pattern-avoiding words. Our studies were ex-tended to 123-representation of graphs in [8], where more results on 132-representable graphs were obtained as well. Further steps may be in consid-ering longer patterns and/or patterns of other types (e.g. those described15in [2, 4]) while defining words to be used to represent graphs, and askingthe question on which classes of graphs can be represented in this way. Si-multaneous avoidance of patterns, like avoiding the patterns 132 and 231 atthe same time, can be considered as well.To conclude, we state the following question, solving which by exhaustivesearch would involve finding appropriate labelling of graphs and then con-sidering all words over six letter alphabet that have at most two occurrencesof each letter.Question: Is the wheel graph W5 the only non-132-representable graph onsix vertices?AcknowledgmentsThe first author was supported by the National Science Foundation of China.The second author is grateful to Bill Chen and Arthur Yang for their hos-pitality during the author’s stay at the Center for Combinatorics at NankaiUniversity in November 2015.

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the features of these diseases with variable frequency; it is more prevalent in Sjögren syn-drome. Peripheral neuropathy is often seen in the course of the disease. Nonetheless, it may be also a presenting sign or the unique feature of immune system dysfunction. Neuropathies in connective tissue diseases are related mainly to vasculitic disorder. It requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to improve its outcome. Peripheral neuropa-thy in connective tissue diseases could be multifocal and asymmetric, or confluent and symmetrical. This chapter reviews the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic fea-tures of neuropathies associated with the common diffuse connective tissue diseases.Keywords: peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis, connective tissue disease,  treatment, electromyography, nerve biopsy1. IntroductionConnective tissue diseases (CTDs) are defined as a group of acquired diseases resulting from persistent immune-mediated inflammation. They are generally the consequence of autoimmune dysregulation resulting in generation of autoreactive T cells or autoantibodies [1]. Immune disorders can affect any organ of the human body responsible for multisystem involvement. The CTDs classily include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome (SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), dermatomyosi-tis and polymyositis (PM/DM), undifferentiated CTD (UTCD) and overlap syndromes such as mixed CTD (MCTD). Most clinicians do not include systemic necrotizing vas-culitis, e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome and Wegener’s granuloma-tosis in the category of CTD [1]. Peripheral neuropathies (PN) may complicate many different systemic autoimmune diseases. PN in CTD large clinical, histopathological and pathogenic spectrum [2]. We aim in this chapter to precise the epidemiology, the pathogenesis, the diagnosis and the treatment of neuropathies in CTD including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome (SS), dermatomyositis and polymyositis (PM/DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and mixed CTD (MCTD).2.  Epidemiology of peripheral neuropathy associated with connective tissue diseases and its topographic distributionPN is one of the clinical features of CTD with variable frequency and prognosis. It is often seen in the course of the disease. However, it may also be a presenting Demystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions2sign or the unique feature of immune system dysfunction [3]. The prevalence of PN is different in the literature series depending on the type of CTD and the means of diagnosis. The incidence of PN in SS is 10–60%, and many of these patients (40–93%) present with neuropathy as the sentinel symptom [4]. PN in SLE patients ranges from 25 to 50% based on electrodiagnostic studies. Curiously, the incidence drops to only 5% based on clinical criteria [5, 6]. Finally, PN is rarely associated with the other CTD, namely, SSc, MCTD, DM and PM [4].PN refers to the part of a spinal nerve distal to the root and plexus. It is a damage or a disease affecting nerves [7–9]. Neuropathy affecting one nerve is called “mono-neuropathy” and neuropathy affecting multiple nerves in the same areas on both sides of the body is named “symmetrical polyneuropathy”. When separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected, the neuropathy is called mononeuritis multi-plex, multifocal mononeuropathy or multiple mononeuropathy [8, 10, 11]. Types of neuropathies that are associated with CTD are outlined in Table 1.3. Pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in connective tissue diseasesThe principal components in the pathogenesis of peripheral nerve lesions in diffuse CTD are ischemia due to vasculitis and immune abnormalities. Generally, most of patients have a combination of the ischemic, immunological and metabolic mechanisms of damage to the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, one com-ponent may be predominant in a different stage of the disease. In systemic sclero-derma, the greater role is played by ischemic mechanisms, mainly in the initial states of the disease, while SLE may involve the participation of immunological mechanisms, especially in acute and subacute disease with high level of autoim-mune activity [13].3.1 Vasculitic neuropathyThe immunopathogenesis of vasculitis in CTD is still unclear. The accumulation of immune complexes in the vasa nervorum initiates the leukocytoclastic reaction, which is characterized by segmental fibrinoid necrosis and transmural inflam-matory cell infiltration. Vasculitis induces the occlusion of vasa nervorum at the Vasculitic neuropathy Mononeuropathy multiplex Asymmetrical polyneuropathy Distal symmetrical polyneuropathyDistal axonal polyneuropathyCompression neuropathySensory neuronopathyTrigeminal sensory neuropathyOther types of neuropathies associated with connective tissue disease Acute demyelinating polyneuropathy Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathyTable 1. Types of neuropathies associated with CTD (adapted from neuropathies in connective tissue disease/Richard K) [12].3Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue DiseasesDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271epineurial arteries and produces nerve infarction. Nerve infarcts typically lead to axonal degeneration [14]. Demyelination and conduction block may occur tran-siently but are usually not a predominant or persistent finding [15]. The clinical and electrophysiological features of neuropathies correlate with the rapidity of onset of ischemia. Acute ischemia induces the development of mononeuropathy, while prolonged circulatory insufficiency is associated with chronic polyneuropathy. The compression-ischemic mechanism leads to the formation of tunnel syndromes [13, 14, 16, 17]. The Peripheral Nerve Society task force has recently proposed a clas-sification that categorizes vasculitic neuropathy into primary systemic vasculitides, secondary systemic vasculitides including CTD and nonsystemic or localized vasculitis on the basis of disease associations [18].3.2 Autoimmune disordersPatients with diffuse CTD may have IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies in their serum, which are associated with severe signs of neural lesions, as dem-onstrated by electromyogram [13]. Moreover, serum levels of anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibodies are greater than normal in 32.1% of patients with diffuse CTD. Increased serum levels of anti-NGF are associated with high disease activity and more severe nervous system involvement [13].3.3 Metabolic disorderPeripheral nervous system abnormalities in CTD are also explained by metabolic disorder secondary to aggressive therapy, multiorgan pathology and endocrine abnormalities in these patients. Metabolic disorder may induce a reaction of demy-elization and axon dystrophy in severe cases [13].4. Clinical practice guidelines of peripheral neuropathy in CTDIn CTD neuropathic symptoms often start gradually and then get worse. Deep proximal aching pain is the first sign in the affected limb. Burning pain in the cutaneous distribution of the affected nerve is frequent. Weakness and numbness usually appear over several hours to several days after the pain. The delay of the former symptoms is explained by the nerve infarction. On physical examination, most patients have pain and temperature sensory loss in the distribution of the affected nerve. A few patients have impairment of vibration and position sense. Hyporeflexia is also rare except in the ankles. In fact, tendon reflexes other than at the ankle are lost only if the femoral, musculocutaneous, or radial nerves are affected proximally [12, 18, 19]. The quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a tool to analyse the perception in response to external stimuli of controlled intensity. It has been used for the early diagnosis and follow-up of small fibre neuropathies. Although the QST is time-consuming and it is modified also in non-neuropathic pain as in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory myalgia, it cannot be taken alone as a conclusive demonstration of PN [20]. The QST is helpful to quantify the effects of treatments on allodynia and hyperalgesia and may reveal a differential efficacy of treatments on different pain components (grade A) [20]. According to EFNS international guidelines, to evaluate hyperalgesia in PN, it is recommended to use simple tools such as a brush and at least one high-intensity weighted pin-prick or von Frey filament. The evaluation of pain in response to thermal stimuli Demystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions4is best performed by using the thermotest which is recommended for pathophysi-ological research or treatment trials. The DN4 may be a useful instrument for the daily diagnostic of PN in CTD [21].5. Diagnosis and clinical resultsIn patient with multiorgan involvement and mononeuropathy multiplex, the diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy is usually easy. However, the diagnosis may be more difficult in less typical presentations of CTD or when peripheral neuropathy is the unique manifestation of the disease. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in CTD particularly in atypical situation is based first on clinical and physical exami-nations. Electromyography confirms even an underlying axonal neuropathy. The most characteristic electromyographic finding in vasculitic neuropathy described in the previous series is axonal degeneration with multifocal distribution. The typical feature is a low sensory nerve and compound muscle action potential amplitudes in a non-length-dependent distribution with normal or minimally reduced conduction velocities [15, 17, 22, 23]. A partial conduction block is rare, and it is seen transiently and early in stage of nerve ischemia [12]. Laboratory tests may be helpful in estab-lishing the presence of systemic vasculitis or identifying previously undiagnosed connective tissue disease. Evaluation of patients with suspected neuropathy in CTD should include liver and kidney function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urinalysis as well as a complete blood count. The choice of immunological test including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, cryoglobulins, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody and serum complement depends on the clinical pre-sentation of the patient. Nerve biopsy may be helpful in demonstrating vasculitic process. A concomitant muscle specimen is useful to increase diagnostic yield because of the patchy distribution of vasculitic lesions [18].6. Particularity of PN in each CTD6.1 Peripheral neuropathy in Sjögren syndromeSjögren syndrome is a CTD more prevalent in women at the age of menopause. It is characterized by sicca syndrome and other extra-glandular symptoms. Peripheral nervous involvement in Sjögren syndrome (SS) is reported with variable frequency because of diverse methods for detection of neuropathy and may precede the onset of the disease or be the initial diagnostic clue [24]. The most common feature is symmetrical distal sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and trigeminal sensory neuropathy. Mononeuritis multiplex, chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and motor neuropathy are less common [8].6.1.1 GanglionopathiesSensory ganglionopathy is characterized by an impairment of kinesthetic aware-ness. Patients have the profound handicap of proprioceptive sense affecting larger joints. Electromyogram shows unelicitable sensory nerve action potentials, with preservation of compound motor action potentials [25]. When MRI is performed, it can reveal T2 hyperintensities limited to the gracile and cuneatus tracts of the dorsal spinal cord with sensory neuronopathies [26]. There are two mechanisms evoked in the pathogenesis of gangliopathies in SS. First, the cellular autoimmu-nity, confirmed by the infiltration of mononuclear and predominantly T cells in 5Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue DiseasesDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271the dorsal root ganglia, is associated with cellular degeneration in the absence of vasculitis [25, 27, 28]. Second, recent studies have suggested that the presence of antibodies against the G-bodies, which are a subcellular aggregation of noncoding RNA intermediates and proteins, is associated to neuropathy [29, 30]. Moreover, It was reported that antineuronal antibodies were seen more frequently in Sjögren patients with severe peripheral neuropathy (PN) complications [25].6.1.2 Small fibre neuropathiesSmall fibre neuropathy is the most common PN manifestation of SS. It is a painful, sensory neuropathy affecting the nociceptive A-alpha and unmyelinated C-fibres. Small fibre neuropathy is reported with variable frequency. In the Hopkins Green Sjögren cohort, it was described as the most frequent manifestation [31]. The onset of small fibre neuropathy is usually subacute to chronic, occurring over weeks to months, although cases with hyperacute evolution of hours to days have been reported [27]. The cardinal clinical symptom of isolated small fibre neuropathy is an excruciating burning pain. The physical examination reveals a selective impairment in small-fibre modalities of pinprick and temperature, with relatively preserved vibratory sense and proprioception. The diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy is based on skin biopsy, which assesses the low density of intraepidermal nerve fibres [25, 32].6.1.3 Sensorimotor polyneuropathiesThe majority of studies reported that axonal polyneuropathies as the most frequent type of PN in SS. The onset of sensorimotor polyneuropathy is usually sub-acute or chronic. The axonal sensory neuropathies are characterized by propriocep-tive sensory loss and motor reflexes, and there are diminished sensory nerve action potentials in electromyogram [25]. The sensory symptoms, however, are gradually accompanied by muscle weakness in a distal, symmetrical distribution [32].6.1.4 Multiple mononeuropathyIt is the transduction of vasculitic neuropathy, and it is very uncommon in SS reported in 0–5% in previous studies. It is usually associated with extra-glandular manifestations [25, 27, 33–35]. Patients with SS and presenting mononeuritis multiplex should be assessed for cryoglobulinemia polyclonal (types II and III) rather than mono-clonal (type I) mainly when there is high-titer rheumatoid factor positivity or when there is disproportionate C4 hypocomplementemia, with normal levels of C3. When nerve biopsy is performed, it may show a lymphocytic or necrotizing vasculitis [32].6.1.5 Cranial neuropathiesThe most common cranial neuropathy in SS is the trigeminal neuropathy, which is usually progressive and can be bilateral and requires symptomatic treatment. Motor dysfunction of cranial nerves is less common, and the facial nerve is the most cranial nerve targeted. The acute onset of cranial neuropathy is due to vasculitic mechanism especially when associated with equally rapid development of multiple mononeuropathies in the extremities [25].6.1.6 Demyelinating neuropathiesDemyelinating neuropathy is a rare manifestation of SS [32, 33]. Cases of chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy have been the subject of case Demystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions6reports in Sjögren patients but have not been substantially described in larger case series. The most common neurophysiologic finding in demyelinating neuropathies was demyelination of the motor nerves [36–38]. The onset of this neuropathy is subacute and characterized by severe proximal and distal weakness and proprio-ceptive sensory deficit. Treatment with steroid and sometimes with intravenous immune globulins may be effective [32, 39].6.1.7 Autonomic neuropathyAutonomic neuropathy is the rarest type of peripheral nerve involvement in SS because it is usually underdiagnosed. The clinical manifestations of autonomic neuropathy will vary depending on the organs which are affected. Symptoms range from urinary symptoms to severe disabling postural hypotension [27, 32, 38]. In recent studies, autonomic dysfunction is associated with the severity of fatigue in patients with primary SS. However, no association was detected between autonomic dysfunction and exocrine function in these patients [32, 40].6.2 Peripheral neuropathy in systemic erythematosus lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations as cutaneous, renal and articular manifestations (Figure 1). Affected patients typically have subacute or chronic distal symmetrical polyneuropathies with predominant sensory symptoms. Distal symmetrical axonal degeneration is the major feature of most cases, although other types of peripheral neuropathy have been described [12, 41]. Oomatia reported the subtypes of peripheral neuropathy (PN) attributable to SLE in a group of 82 patients out of 2097 and detailed in Table 2 [42]. Other features such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, plexopathy and autonomic neuropathy are very low in all series Figure 1. Butterfly rash in systemic lupus erythematosus.7Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue DiseasesDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271[41]. In recent data, small fibre neuropathy is more frequent in SLE, and the decreased intraepidermal nerve fibre density of unmyelinated fibres is a diagnostic test [42]. The mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy in SLE are unclear. Several factors have been reported particularly small-vessel vasculitis and lesions induced by autoimmune antibodies and immune complexes. In series, where nerve biopsy is performed, the anatomopathologic aspect was perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and variable intimal thickening without necrotizing vasculitis. The presence of necrotizing vasculitis is possible and constitutes a prognostic factor of the disease [12, 41, 43]. Endoneurial mononuclear cell infiltration and increased class II antigen expression were also noticed [12, 43].6.3 Peripheral neuropathy in systemic sclerosisSystemic sclerosis is a rare connective tissue disease with a prevalence of 1 in 10,000 [44]. It is characterized by symmetrical, widespread thickening of the skin (Figure 2) [45]. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy is unknown with reported ranges in retrospective studies varying from 0.01 to 14% of patients [46, 47]. Vascular-dependent neuropathy is the principal mechanism inducing a distal symmetric, mainly sensory polyneuropathy as in other connective tissue diseases [13, 46, 47]. Cranial mononeuropathies can also occur, mainly the trigeminal nerve, leading to numbness and dysesthesias in the face. Rarely the seventh and ninth cranial neuropathies are affected [11]. The electrophysiological features are those of sensory axonopathy [11]. Rare cases of mononeuritis multiplex have been mentioned in the course of limited SSc (CREST: calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) and are due to a necrotizing vasculitis [11].6.4 Peripheral neuropathy in mixed connective tissue diseaseMixed connective tissue disease is defined as the overlap of SLE, SSc and PM, with a high titer of extractable nuclear antigen and its ribonucleoprotein compo-nent [48]. Mild distal axonal polyneuropathy was exceptionally reported in 2 of 20 patients with mixed connective tissue disease, but there has not been a detailed study of the neuropathy or its treatment [48].Type of peripheral neuropathy Frequency no.

Type of peripheral neuropathy in SLE (adapted from peripheral neuropathies in systemic lupus erythematous/Oomatia et al.) [42].Demystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions86.5 Peripheral neuropathy in dermatomyositis and polymyositisNerve involvement in patients with DM is mediated through membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, leading to nerve injury. This entity called “neuromyo-sitis” was first reported in 1890 [49]. Further studies showed a frequency of 7.5% in DM or PM patients with polyneuropathy [50]. Neuropathy due to DM is difficult to diagnose due to necessity of excluding other comorbid etiologic conditions and het-erogeneity of muscular manifestations [49]. Nerve biopsy may reveal endothelial vascular injury, and immunohistochemical stains revealed increased expression of perivascular VEGF and demyelinization associated or not with inflammation [51].7. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy in CTD7.1 General approachThere are no treatment guidelines specific to each CTD. In general, the manage-ment of PN is based on symptomatic treatment of pain as in other causes of neurop-athies. Typically, patients with painful polyneuropathies respond to drugs known to be effective for neuropathic pain, including tricyclic antidepressants and a variety of antiepileptic drugs as gabapentin and pregabalin, which is preferred because of its better bioavailability [52]. Concerning the antidepressants, international guide-lines provide the same level of recommendation for nonselective tricyclic antide-pressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Most clinical trials showed that the efficacy of SNRIs is lower than that of tricyclic antidepres-sants. However, tricyclic antidepressants have more side effects in elderly and are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, prostate hypertrophy or some cardiac conduction disturbances. Venlafaxine is a SNRI who has shown efficacy in painful polyneuropathies of different origins [53]. In CTD, PN is mainly due to vasculitic Figure 2. Sclerosis of the face in systemic sclerosis.9Peripheral Neuropathy in Connective Tissue DiseasesDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82271and immune abnormalities. So when vasculitic neuropathy is diagnosed, cortico-steroids should be promptly introduced to recover sensory and motor deficits [3]. Most authors recommend starting oral prednisone at high dose of 1 mg/kg per day. In severe cases, intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone of one 1 g for 3–5 days might be appropriate for initial treatment. This treatment should be maintained during the subacute phase, and after 6 to 8 weeks, the treatment should be tapered progressively. Immunosuppressant therapy is associated to corticosteroids in severe forms of vasculitic neuropathy or in systemic vasculitic PN. Cyclophosphamide seems to be the most effective drug for induction of remission and improvement of survival in non-viral systemic vasculitides [18]. Most patients need 3–12 months of cyclophosphamide induction therapy before they can be switched to a maintenance immunosuppressant [54]. Immunosuppressant used as a maintenance therapy is azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil [55]. Intravenous immuno-globulin is a safe treatment used in serious systemic PN with clinical benefit [18].7.2 Particularities of treatment in each CTDTherapeutic strategies of small fibre neuropathy in SS are still unclear. Carbamazepine is generally the first-line agent for trigeminal neuralgia. The use PNS manifestation First-line treatment approach Treatment of refractory casesPolyneuropathy Neurotrophic agents (tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI (duloxetine, venlafaxine), anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin)) (glucocorticoids  (1 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent))Severe forms: immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide)CarbamazepineHigh-dose IVIGPEXRituximabMononeuropathy single/multipleSystemic glucocorticoids (1–2 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent or pulses of methylprednisolone 500/1000 mg for 3–5 days with long-term dosage reduction)IVCyclophosphamideRituximab, IVIG, PEXMycophenolate mofetilAzathioprineSmall fibre neuropathy Neurotrophic agents (tricyclic antidepressants,SNRI (duloxetine, venlafaxine), anticonvulsants(gabapentin, pregabalin)), topical anaestheticsAnalgesicsImmunosuppressantsIVIGPsychological supportAcute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (GBS)High-dose IVIGPEXCardiorespiratory supporting measuresGlucocorticoids (1 mg/kg/day of prednisone 1000 mg for 3 days)Equivalent or pulses of methylprednisolone and immunosuppressants – cyclophosphamideCranial neuropathy Glucocorticoids (1 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent) with long-term dosage reductionSpontaneous recovery possible for oculomotor involvementCyclophosphamideimmunosuppressants as maintenance treatmentPNS: peripheral nervous system; SNRI: serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; IVIG: intravenous immunoglobulins; PEX: plasma exchange; GBS: Guillain Barré Syndrom.Table 3. Treatment options available for peripheral nervous system involvement in patients with SLE (adapted from PNS involvement in SLE/A. Bortoluzzi et al.) [60].Demystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions10of other antiepileptic agents such as gabapentin should be prescribed with slow titration to minimize its side effects particularly over somnolence and fatigue. The duration of therapeutic trial should be at least 3 months. The secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline and desipramine have fewer anticholinergic side effects and a proven efficacy in neuropathic pain, and so they may be slowly prescribed in patients with SS. The use of new immunosup-pressant agents mainly monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 antigen on B cells as rituximab and the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors such as adalimumab has been reported to be efficient in the small fibre neuropathies occurring in SS [25]. The management of axonal polyneuropathy is based on a symptomatic treatment; corticosteroids and immunosuppressors are discussed in the case of motor neuropathy with rapid progression [25]. In the case of multiple mononeuropathy, the presence of vasculitis is associated with a good response to immunosuppressive therapy [34]. There is evidence supporting the use of immunoglobulin therapy in Sjögren-associated sensorimotor and non-ataxic sensory neuropathy from retrospective and observational cohorts and case reports [56, 57].In SLE, there are no clear guidelines on the treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Induction treatments with glucocorticoids with or without immunosuppressant agents are indicated in the situation of active vasculitic neuropathy [58]. In the case of necrotizing vasculitis, treatment with plasmapheresis, steroids and immunosup-pressant has led to improvement [59, 60]. The definitions of response to treatment are variable between studies. Overall, the rate of global response (complete or partial) is more than 50% [41] (Table 3).In SSc, there is not enough data regarding the response of scleroderma-associated neuropathy to immunosuppression [11, 61]. However, this therapy seems to be effective in mononeuritis multiplex and sensorimotor polyneuropathy with inflam-matory process [11]. In DM/PM the treatment of PN is based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressant agents depending on the severity of the clinic presentation [51].PNS, peripheral nervous system; SNRI, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulins; PEX, plasma exchange; GBS, Guillain-Barré syndrome.8. Conclusion8.1 Final considerationsPN is one of the possible neurologic manifestations encountered by physi-cians in CTD. Coexistence of both conditions is explained by immune-mediated factors particularly a vasculitis of peripheral nerve. Therefore, it is important to take a detailed medical history and examination and then adequate investigations to assess for an underlying systemic autoimmune diseases that may be associated with the neuropathy. Pure sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies are the most common PN features in these disorders. Acute to subacutely evolving multifocal or asymmetric neuropathy suggests a vasculitic cause. This situation constitutes a prognostic factor of the disease and requires prompt treatment with steroids and immunosuppressant agents. The treatment of PN in CTD progresses in three fronts: first, to identify the type of PN through the medical history and physical exam; second, to precise the pathogenic mechanism of neuropathy via clinical presenta-tion, electromyographic data and in unclear situation the nerve biopsy and finally, the efficient control of pain. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for vasculitic neuropathy in CTD.11© 2018 The Author(s). Licensee IntechOpen.

In future, we need also further studies to precise clear guidelines to diagnose PN related to CTD such as more specific features in the electromyogram and neuro-muscular biopsy. Moreover, in the treatment approach of PN in CTD, we need further researches to identify curative drugs targeting the pathogenesis pathways rather than the symptomatic and the previous conventional therapy.Conflict of interestThere is no conflict of interest.Author detailsMouna Snoussi*, Faten Frikha and Zouhir BahloulDepartment of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Sfax, Tunisia*Address all correspondence to: mounasnoussi23@yahoo.fr12Demystifying Polyneuropathy - Recent Advances and New Directions[1] Kumar TS, Aggarwal A. Approach to a patient with connective tissue disease.

"Over the last decade, the avian influenza virus, H5N1, has spread across most of Asia and Europe and parts of Africa. In some countries – including Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Egypt – the avian disease has probably become endemic. There has, as yet, been no human pandemic, although 245 deaths have been reported since 2003. A major international response has been launched, backed by over $2 billion of public money. Huge numbers of poultry have been culled, vaccination campaigns have been implemented and markets have been restructured. These efforts have affected the livelihoods and businesses of millions. In addition, substantial efforts have been invested in improving human and animal health systems, combined with major investments in drug and vaccine development. Detailed contingency and preparedness plans have been devised in case a pandemic occurs.\r\rThis paper asks: what lessons can we learn from this experience, and what does this mean for future efforts to respond to emerging infectious diseases under the One World, One Health initiative? The paper explores three core narratives that have shaped the response: one focuses on veterinary issues, another on human public health and a third on pandemic preparedness. All have common characteristics, emphasising outbreak control and containment. Missing dimensions are identified, including a lack of attention to underlying disease drivers, issues of poverty and equity and broader questions of access and governance. The paper examines how discourses of security and risk pervade the discussions, affecting how the response has played out.

INTRODUCTIONOn June 11th 2008 another outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) was reported in Hong Kong – the site of the first reported human deaths from this virus in 1997. Media reports portrayed the possibility of a major catastrophe. Anxious citizens stopped eating chicken. With China hosting the Olympics in a matter of weeks, concerns were raised in the highest circles about the consequences of an outbreak – for world profile and for business. Politicians wanted firm action. On June 20th, officials proposed a package of US$128 million to put the small-scale poultry sector and wet markets out of business. Traders have rejected the proposal, and many consumers argue that the alternative frozen supermarket chickens are not what they want. Others argue that attempts at regulating imports and banning wet markets are futile. Informal, unregulated trade abounds, and with South China being a known, if poorly reported, hot spot of avian influenza virus circulation, the chances of keeping Hong Kong free of the disease are very small indeed. Yet, sceptics argue that the proposed measures are more about political grandstanding and public relations than sensible, science-based control policies. They argue that the net consequences for farmers’, traders’ and poorer consumers’ livelihoods will be negative, with only the well-connected large suppliers and supermarkets benefiting. But, given the fears around viral mutation into a form capable of efficient human-to-human transmission, others conclude that precaution, even if drastic, is the most appropriate route1. This example highlights the complex trade-offs involved in policy processes around avian influenza. These are intensely political, pitting different interests and groups of actors against each other. Public image, business interests and poor people’s livelihoods are all involved in a complex mix. And the science often is so uncertain that firm decisions based on exact predictions and precise measures are impossible. Judgements – normally political judgements – are made, and these are necessarily highly contextual. Media pressure, political effectiveness, implementation capacity and geopolitical positioning all come into the picture. Thus, in order to understand the politics of the international policy response to avian influenza, we must explore an intersecting story of virus genetics, ecology and epidemiology with economic, political and policy machinations in a variety of places – from Hong Kong to Washington, to Jakarta, Cairo, Rome and London. This paper offers one, necessarily partial and incomplete, view of the story over 1 Economist June 28 2008, http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11622415; see http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm1the last decade – and particularly the last few years when over $2 billion of public funds have been mobilised. It is a fascinating and important story. It is important because the HPAI story is seen by many as a ‘dress rehearsal’ for a major pandemic emerging from a zoonotic disease, whereby a combination of viral genetic change and ecological circumstance results in transmission of a new disease among humans, with devastating consequences. The 1918 human influenza pandemic killed at least 50 - 100 million people globally2. Estimates for future pandemics vary widely, but a simple calculation sees three times that number given the world’s increased population3. And we are of course in the midst of the catastrophic pandemic of HIV/AIDS which had its origins as a zoonosis, and which, for a range of reasons, was not spotted early enough and spread widely. Between 1940 and 2004 over 300 new infectious diseases emerged, some 60 per cent of which were zoonoses from animals4. That a pandemic influenza strain has not yet emerged from the H5N1 virus currently circulating, at least at the time of writing this paper, is no reason for complacency. An influenza pandemic will happen, it is argued convincingly - some time, somewhere - and we had better be ready for it. For this reason, exploring the successes and failures of the avian influenza response to date is an important task. The avian influenza response story is fascinating because it offers insights into some wider dilemmas surrounding animal health, production and trade, public health, emergency responses and long-term development, and the global governance of all of these. As with many high-profile policy debates, there are multiple, competing policy formulae and diverse, sometimes conflicting, intervention responses. There are a vast range of actors, associated with numerous networks, often cutting across sectoral boundaries, public/private divides and local, national and global settings. Avian influenza has caused a massive mobilisation of public funds, involving numerous agencies and resulting in countless initiatives, programmes and projects. Yet there has been often remarkable collaboration across what had previously been deep organisational and professional divides. There has also been a range of organisational innovation and experimentation. These offer important insights into what to do – and indeed what not to do – in the future. In other words, the avian influenza response offers some important perspectives on some of the ‘big issues’ of the moment. These include, for example, how to respond to uncertain threats which have transnational implications; how to cut across the emergency-development divide, making sure crises result in longer term responses as well as dealing with immediate needs; how to balance interests and priorities between ensuring health and safety as well as livelihoods; how to operate effectively in a complex multilateral system, within and beyond the UN; what a commitment to ‘security’ in health and livelihoods really means in practice; and much, much more. These are of course all massive, and highly contentious, issues, and this paper will not provide any neat and tidy answers. What it aims to do instead is, through an analytical lens which looks at the politics of policy processes, shed light on these issues, sharpening the questions raised and the trade-offs implied. As the global avian influenza response moves towards a bigger, overarching ‘One World, One Health’ agenda, focusing on the intersections of animal, human and ecosystem health proposed at the December 2007 Delhi inter-ministerial meeting5 and being elaborated for the 2008 Sharm El-Sheikh international ministerial conference, these issues become even more pertinent. We are interested in asking: given the lessons of the international response to date, what should be the features of an effective, equitable and resilient response infrastructure at the international level? In essence, what should a ‘One World, One Health’ initiative look like in practice?2. THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE: 1997-2008There has now been more than a decade of experience since the Hong Kong avian influenza H5N1 outbreak of 1997 when 18 people were infected and six died. Since 2003 245 people are reported to have died from infection with this virus across the world, with mortalities highly concentrated in a few countries, mostly in South East Asia6. The avian virus has spread across most of Asia and Europe, with regular, usually seasonally-defined, outbreaks in poultry. In some countries – and the list varies, but always includes Indonesia, China and Egypt – the disease has become endemic among bird populations. In response to these outbreaks over two billion poultry have been culled, affecting the livelihoods and businesses of millions7. Thus, while a major human pandemic has thankfully not occurred, the disease and the consequences of the resulting policy interventions have been far reaching and, in certain contexts for certain people, dramatic. Figure 1 offers a map of the spread of the virus across the world.2 Johnson and Müller (2002). As the iconic event of the past century, around which much media and policy discussion has centred, the 1918 pandemic has been the subject of intense research, ranging from social histories to technical assessments (cf. Morens and Facui 2007; Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Taubenberger et al 2005).3 Murray et al (2007) offer a more sophisticated analysis.4 See, for example: Woolhouse 2008; Jones et al, 2008; Webster et al 2007; Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Woolhouse et al, 2006; Webster 2002.5 See Wildlife Conservation Society 2004, http://www.wcs.org/sw-high_tech_tools/wildlifehealthscience/owoh  for an early exposition of the ‘One World, One Health’ concept.

For useful reviews, see MacKellar (2007) and Parry (2007). 7 World Bank (2005); (2005a); McKibben and Sidorenko (2006).32The H5N1 avian influenza virus has thus had a substantial impact. How then has a miniscule virus, made up of a few strands of RNA and a protein coating which might, or might not, have a devastating impact on human populations, influenced policy and practice globally? Appendix 1 shows two timelines stretching over the period since 1997, with a number of key moments identified. Biological, economic and policy processes are mutually intertwined, co-constructing the response. Epidemiological processes of spread – through wild birds, trade or poor market hygiene – are influenced by policies which result in mass culls of poultry, banning wet markets, or imposing import regulations. In different settings these measures may restrict spread – or actually increase it, as they drive activities underground. What has happened in practice is highly dependent on the way different contexts affect this interplay between biology, economic interests and policy. In some parts of the world – notably in Europe, but also in Thailand, Hong Kong, and, for a time, Vietnam – policies have influenced disease incidence and spread in ways that have seen intermittent outbreaks being controlled and managed increasingly effectively. In other places, this has not been the case, and the disease has become endemic, with regular outbreaks occurring, and little likelihood of eliminating the virus8. In terms of the global policy response, it is the former context – of controlled virus and stamping out of intermittent outbreaks – that has dominated thinking and practice, while the latter context – of an endemic disease situation – has been largely ignored – or denied. As figure 2 highlights, concerns in many quarters rose as the disease spread from isolated outbreaks in South East Asia – first to central Asia, then to Europe and Africa. The speech by US President George Bush in September 2005 to the United Nations indicated strongly that the US was taking this very seriously9. In the post 9/11 world where threats to US homeland security could arise from terrorism and infectious disease – and potentially deadly combinations of the two – the spectre of a major pandemic rang alarm bells. As a US government official put it. Figure 1. Confirmed occurrence of H5N1 in poultry and wild birds since 2003In the wake of 9/11 scenario and the transformation of the institutional response capability within the US, we were looking at a sort of all hazards approach, and how the White House sees that with homeland security, it was kind of natural to see this potential threat in a broader context and to respond to it in a fairly robust manner… Also the sensitivity to criticism that came out of Katrina lent the whole White House focus a sharp edge. We don’t want to be criticised like that again so we really need to do a good job on this… It is one of our high priorities because this is a presidential initiative and the president has an interest in what is going on…there’s the White House, the Homeland Security Council, that’s a sort of national security council, and they’ve had the primary lead, and it’s a real lead. If something happens it’s homeland security. It’s very much in a security framework10.8 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007a); Sims (2007).9 http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050914.html10 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.Figure 2. The international avian influenza response: an actor-network diagram54An unforgiving electorate, an anxious population and a media that fed off ever more terrifying disaster scenarios was a potent mix. The UN was concerned too. What would happen if an influenza pandemic really did occur? How would national and international systems cope – and how would the UN respond? Across Asia, Europe and the US there was very real concern: “Governments thought a pandemic was around the corner. Really, ASEAN heads of government were particularly concerned”12. Concerns were also being raised by country officials, as well as UN, World Bank and other agency staff based particularly in south-east Asia. This provoked high level discussions among the Deputy UN Secretary General and the then Secretary General, and David Nabarro was appointed ‘UN System Influenza Coordinator’ in September 2005. Estimates of huge potential mortalities made at the time of his appointment provoked a major furore among the technical agencies, but it certainly resulted in the raising of the profile of the issue among a wider constituency, moving the debate from concerns at the ‘periphery’ right to the centre of the global system13. This was accelerated by the arrival of H5N1 in Europe and human cases in Turkey in January 2006. The possibility of a major pandemic looked to be potentially just around the corner. But there was not one single political motivation for action. Different pressures and influences arose on different sides of the Atlantic. In the US, as already mentioned, the ‘homeland security’ and ‘bioterror’ angle was critical. But so was, according to some, lobbying from pharmaceutical business interests, keen to create new market opportunities from the avian influenza crisis. This dynamic took a different complexion in Europe, however. As one informant argued:11 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.12 David Nabarro, review comment, August 2008.13 Bird Flu ‘Could Kill 150m People.’  BBC Online 30 September 2005 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4292426.stmThe EU, of course, sees harmonisation among member states as key. While market drivers are there, the pharma industry in Europe is more established, stable. They are worried about the politics of the Union: the two-speed Europe. Avian influenza was a very useful basis for mending political fences – dealing with the aberrations of a two-track Europe. Fake urgency helped bring things together. It helped push the political process forward14.So, while policy narratives were being constructed in the context of ‘big politics’, this intersected with more technical debates. In 2005 a series of models were produced which showed the potential of spread from isolated outbreaks, and the importance of control and containment measures of various sorts (Longini et al 2005; Ferguson et al 2005). At the same time scientific assessments of the H5N1 virus showed its variability and the potential for rapid change. While couched in cautions and provisos, these emerging findings provided further impetus towards a concerted response. Business interests got in the act too. The anti-viral oseltamivir (Hoffmann-La Roche’s Tamiflu) was presented as an important stop-gap measure, reducing the impact of the virus in infected individuals. Governments quickly ordered stockpiles and the public sought supplies from any source15. Meanwhile vaccine manufacturers went in search of an elusive vaccine solution – one that would deal with seasonal influenzas as well as potential pandemic strains, at least until a more targeted one could be developed16. In 2005 the new International Health Regulations were published in response to the crisis17. These allowed for direct intervention at source in response to globally threatening disease situations. They also required a more streamlined and effective reporting system, building on the successful response following the SARS outbreaks of 2002-03. As discussed in more depth below, the IHR 2005 signalled an important shift in the international governance of public health issues, with a ceding of national sovereignty, at least in theory, in the face of a global threat (cf. Heymann 2006). The Beijing inter-ministerial pledging conference, held in January 2006, provided a focus for the growing global effort. US$1.8 billion were pledged, and the main technical agencies – the UN World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) 14 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.15 http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2005/oct/20/birdflu16 see Stöhr and Esveld (2004).17 Fidler (2005b).18 One plan (A Global Strategy for the Progressive Control of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, 2005, later revised 2007) focuses on the animal health aspects and was led by FAO and OIE, with inputs from WHO, see: Food and Agriculture Organisation and Organisation International des Epizooties (2005); Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007b). Another from WHO (Responding to the Avian Influenza Pandemic Threat: Recommended Strategic Actions) focuses on public health aspects, see: http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_CSR_GIP_05_8-EN.pdf, which is currently under revision.Another continued:Now if you are looking at what motivated this I would say it is not a lot of dead chickens. It’s fear of a lot of things. There is no question that the high level of interest at the highest level of government took place because of the fear of a 1918 style epidemic. And I’ve been at meetings in the White House where it was said that the scenario of 1918 was not necessarily the worst case - mortality, morbidity and so on. So what drove this? I think we just have to be frank – it is the fear of a severe human pandemic…. No matter how much we prepare there are huge concerns out there and electorates can be very unforgiving…. There are limits to how much you can do to prevent these kinds of things from happening. The limits changed for us on 9/11. Now we are a lot more concerned about terrorism, but you could argue that it still is not enough if you want to have perfect security. It’s the same with preparing for a pandemic. You can always put more in. But governments have to make decisions, they have to manage risks, and I think this is a risk that the US government, possibly more than any other government, has accentuated to the world. This is a serious risk we have to prepare for11.76– came up with a series of plans and strategies prepared for the conference18. Whilst the issue had been live before, it was at this point that the ambitions and activities of the international response significantly scaled up. This has taken many forms in different places.Much of the core work has focused on the veterinary response, controlling ‘at source’ with the aim of both reducing socio-economic impacts on poultry production as well as reducing human exposure. As veterinarians argued, dealing with avian influenza was not new. They had standard approaches to controlling disease outbreaks which had been tried and tested over many years. What they needed now was more support for doing what they knew how to do already. Thus, as discussed below, standard culling, compensation, vaccination and market restructuring programmes were initiated in line with OIE and FAO guidelines. On the human public health side, programmes focused on drug and vaccine supply and delivery were combined with large scale public education and communication programmes to reduce infection and transmission risks, led by WHO and UNICEF, together with a range of NGOs19. In addition, human pandemic preparedness plans were developed across the world, with 109 country plans completed (if not tested) by the end of 200720. In different sectors and across agencies, scenarios were developed and contingency plans were tested, with UN agencies – UNOCHA (now incorporating PIC) and WFP in particular – often taking the lead.  In sum, there has been a huge amount of activity, and considerable expenditure of resources – totalling way beyond the formal pledged commitments if the wider costs incurred by private companies and industry groups are included in the totals. This has involved large numbers of people, spread across diverse organisations in all parts of the world. What can we learn from all this? This paper does not aim to offer a detailed description of what, where and when, but to probe into the underlying rationales and drivers of different policies and actions. Understanding the policy process involves asking a series of interrelated questions (cf. Keeley and Scoones 2003): 19 World Health Organization (2005) (2006) (2007).20 http://www.un-pic.org/PIC/pages/report_overall.aspx21 Policy narratives are stories told in policy debates. They have clear beginnings (defining the problem), middles (expanding on the context and challenges) and ends (elaboration of solutions). u First, what are the narratives – the storylines21 – which define the way the disease problem is understood and the way the response has unfolded? In other words, how are both problems and solutions framed, and through what mechanisms?u Second, who are the actors involved in these narratives and how are they linked? How do they align – or not – with the main policy narratives being promoted? And how do they align with different interests – professional, organisational, political, commercial? 3. ACTORS, NETWORKS AND NARATIVES: UNPACKING THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSEThe international response has been dominated by what might be termed an overarching ‘outbreak narrative’ (cf. Wald 2008). This has a number of recurrent features which, in turn, create a particular style of policy and politics. A central feature is public fear and worry which permeates public and media debates. This often involves the construction of ‘the other’ – dangerous places and people from where diseases come from, and something to be feared. Another feature of outbreak narratives focuses on western anxieties about globalisation – that we are all connected, and can all be affected, by diseases or other disasters that spread across the globe. In addition, there is often an assumption that outbreaks emerge from disrupted, primordial settings which are pushed ‘out of equilibrium’. This is linked to concerns about protecting the conditions of modernity, where disease is controlled, unlike in the primitive, backward, unregulated contexts where diseases emerge. Cutting through all of this is a politics of control and enforcement by the state – or global bodies with state-like characteristics – that at once constructs and justifies imposition and authority – by authorised, sanctioned expertise or, at the extreme, military-style force. All of these features of ‘outbreak narratives’ (Wald 2008) are present in the avian influenza experience. Understanding how these ways of thinking, talking and presenting ideas in public, academic and policy discourse is essential to unravelling how particular policy processes in particular places emerge. In today’s world, of course, the media – in all its forms – has a major role to play in constructing these biopolitics22, and so framing the narratives and practices of response.  At the peak of the HPAI crisis, the global media had a field day23. Feeding u Third, in this process and over time, what policy spaces open up – and what spaces are closed down? What moments of debate, dispute and dissent exist – over what and between whom? And how do these spaces (or lack of them) affect what can be done?u Finally, overall, we want to ask who wins and who loses through these processes? Whose version wins out, whose gets excluded, and why? And what other narratives, actors and interests exist with different perspectives, and how might these have influence in framing a future One World, One Health initiative?22 Following Foucault, biopower involves the application and impact of power on human life and the body, with biopolitics being the intersection of politics and the life sciences (Rose 2006), see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolitics98on a climate of fear, anxiety and uncertainty in the post 9/11 world, journalists could construct some dire storylines. These were replete with disaster metaphors, conjuring up a politics of fear and blame. In tracing this process up to mid 2005, Nerlich and Halliday (2007) identify an article on human-human transmission in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2005 as a key trigger (Ungchusak et al 2005). This was accompanied by an editorial by Klaus Stöhr (2005), then Coordinator of the Global Influenza Programme of the WHO, that was picked up by the New Scientist and the British Medical Journal the same week. These narratives of fear were of course reinforced by the speculative predictions and projections about potential mortalities, and the doomsday picture painted of collapsed economies, dying millions and a very personal, individual struggle to get hold of vaccines, drugs or safety equipment. So for example from around the time of Nabarro’s September 2005 appointment the following are a small sample of the top headlines, all in reputable publications:‘On a wing and a prayer’: Millions of people killed in highly developed countries within months. Tens of millions worldwide. The global economy in tatters. A Hollywood fantasy? No – it’s now a plausible scenario. The first act, the spread of avian flu to, and probably between, humans, has already started across Asia. Unless the international community now moves decisively to mitigate this pandemic threat, we will in all probability pay heavily within a few years. Then, hard questions will be asked as to why we were not prepared24.‘Bird flu ‘could kill 150m people: Experts fear birds will carry the virus across borders’. A flu pandemic could happen at any time and kill between 5-150 million people, a UN health official has warned. David Nabarro, who is charged with co-ordinating responses to bird flu, said a mutation of the virus affecting Asia could trigger new outbreaks. “It’s like a combination of global warming and HIV/Aids 10 times faster than it’s running at the moment,” Dr Nabarro told the BBC25. ‘Bush seeks military option on bird flu’: President Bush, stirring debate on the worrisome possibility of a bird flu pandemic, suggested dispatching American troops to enforce quarantines in any areas with outbreaks of the killer virus. Bush asserted aggressive action could be needed to prevent a potentially crippling US outbreak of a bird flu strain that is sweeping through Asian poultry and causing specialists to fear it could become the next deadly pandemic. Citing concern that state and local authorities might be unable to contain such an outbreak, Bush asked Congress to give him the authority to call in the military26.This only touches the surface. The blogosphere and the Internet discussion sites offer another whole dimension. Here conspiracy theories and dire scenarios abound – and feed off each other, in a frenzy of outbreak narratives of many sorts27. While of course it is impossible to attribute cause and effect in complex policy processes, many people commented to us that the media, and popular books on the subject, have had an impact on the framing of the policy debate. US President George Bush had reputedly been influenced by the book ‘The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History’ by John Barry, while another well-read popular book, ‘The Coming Plague’ by Laurie Garrett, together with pieces in National Geographic, Newsweek and Time magazine, added to the deluge of commentary. In science-policy circles the coordinated publication of special issues by Foreign Affairs and Nature in 2005 added to the waves of interest and concern. A Foreign Affairs comment piece by Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Policy and Research at the University of Minnesota, was particularly well read (Osterholm 2005a)28. That the technical debate in the scientific journals of Cell, Science or Nature offered a more circumspect, uncertain and confused story, with highly conflicting models and predictions, did not really matter too much29. Headlines matter and policies almost necessarily have to follow a simple narrative storyline – beginning, middle, end; if this is the problem, then this is the solution. News coverage, and so political profile, does matter, across the spectrum of actors involved in the avian influenza response. The technical agencies are not immune. While they argue that it is only the science that justifies their position, the fact that an issue on their patch is in the media spotlight has consequences for profile, exposure and, ultimately, funding.  23 For example, a timeline search of the Google News archive reveals the patterns of press interest since January 2004.24 Nature 435, 385-386 26 May 2005 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/pdf/435385a.pdf 25 BBC ONLINE: Friday, 30 September 2005 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4292426.stm26 The Boston Globe: By Jennifer Loven, Associated Press, October 5, 2005.27 Here is a sample from the blogosphere: “We are playing musical chairs. 300 million people and 3 million chairs”, quote by NS1; “Attempting to prepare the US for a pandemic by making specific recommendations for the government to implement is like trying to cure anaemia by bleeding the patient. The cure for what ails this culture is more self-reliance; we aren’t going to get there by having the government do things we ought to do for ourselves”, quote by LMWatBullRun; “It will take more than ‘good men’ to get us out of this JIT jam. Those good men at the top must also be courageous, smart, informed, and lucky. We face the two most formidable opponents in all of recorded history - an urbanized human race with all of its current psycho-social weaknesses and a developing panflu that more than likely will sputter to life with breadth and depth”, quote by Medical Maven; “Fail to plan = plan to fail. Each of us to some extent is planning for the pandemic, but BROTHER are most of the rest planning to fail! Folks have talked about calling this the “Black Flu” or the “China Flu” or the “Boyd Flu”.

The responses have centred on veterinary control measures and industry ‘restructuring’, with the OIE and FAO being at the centre of the actor-network.u Second, a human public health narrative which certainly dominated the media and political concerns: “human-human spread is the real risk, and could be catastrophic”. Here a combination of drugs, vaccines and behaviour change were seen to dominate the response, one very much centred on the WHO, with UNICEF and a number of NGOs being important players too.u Third, a narrative focused on pandemic preparedness: “a major economic and humanitarian disaster is around the corner and we must be prepared”. Responses focus on civil contingency planning, business continuity approaches and containment strategies. Here, a much wider network of business/industry players and consultants are concerned, linked to different branches of government, notably prime ministers’/presidents’ offices and finance ministries with concerns about the fallout of any pandemic. The humanitarian community – UN agencies, the Red Cross, development NGOs and others – are also important.Such narratives compete for attention in the policy process. One informant put it succinctly: “We’ve got David Nabarro drawing a picture of a spectre that is going to engulf the world, and you’ve got vets saying ‘you can say anything you like, but it is about chickens”30 . Figure 2 offers a diagrammatic interpretation of the constellation of actors involved in the international response. Clearly there are more actors than this, especially those only tangentially engaged, but this diagram is our attempt to map out the actor network based on the extensive interviews undertaken. Our study has primarily focused on the international public response and so underplays the array of actors and interactions within the private sector.In subsequent sections each of these actors and their associated networks will be introduced. At this broader level, however, the diagram offers an insight into a number of important features, pertinent to our broader analysis:u Actors coalesce around the three core outbreak narratives described above. These are distinct actor networks, associated with some lead agencies and key people. But they are not wholly separate: they come together in a number of important bridging In different ways, then, an outbreak narrative dominated across a range of actors and networks. In the context of the avian influenza response, not just one outbreak narrative, but three were important. Each is associated with a particular grouping of people, professions and processes. In the next sections of this paper we look at the following trio:30 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.organisations. On technical issues, the nexus around WHO, FAO, UNICEF and OIE is of course important, with UNSIC playing a key coordinating role, particularly on financial and wider policy issues. On financing, the World Bank has come to play quite an important, bridging role too. u The diagram highlights the sheer number of initiatives – and associated acronyms – that the HPAI response has either spawned or expanded. While no new big coordinating body has been established, as with UNAIDS, it is striking how many initiatives cluster around the core organisations at the centre of the diagram; as someone put it “like bees around the honey pot”.u The cluster of actors around ‘the media’ and ‘politics’ hovers in the corner, but is in practice all pervasive. Different responses to the media and different styles of politics are important, but this dimension has been a persistent and important feature – both in raising the profile of the issue (and so resources) and in the concerns about how, without any major outbreak, the issue seems to be going ‘off the radar’ again, with declining media and political interest.u There are a number of actors who appear on the periphery of the diagram: not well connected to the core players, nor particularly associated with the core narratives. These include a number of NGO players who, in different ways, have been critical of the mainstream framing of the debates, around livelihoods and development and implications for the poultry industry in the case of GRAIN31, and around intellectual property and virus sharing in the case of the Third World Network32. We also have a small circle, but representing a very large group, who have had very little influence on the debate so far at all: small-scale poultry producers, particularly in virus-affected countries in Asia. These, among others, are the marginalised actors who frame the debate in different ways, and offer usually unheard alternative narratives. Section 7 will return to an examination of this group.31 GRAIN Briefing. (2006). ‘Fowl Play - The Poultry Industry’s Central Role In The Bird Flu Crisis.’ from www.grain.org/go/birdflu.32 http://www.twnside.org.sg/An earlier diagram was prepared in the scoping phase of this project (see Scoones and Forster 2007), based on a review of documents and Internet source material available at the time. This helped us identify our starting points for carrying out more detailed interviews. These snowballed out from initial discussions with FAO, WHO and OIE to a range of organisations in Europe and North America. In total we had interviews with 63 people across a range of organisations (see Appendix 2). These have deepened and nuanced our analysis of the politics of policy process, extending our insights and attentions beyond the initial focus. As a very time delimited study, however, we could not cover everything and everybody. Given our focus on the international response, we have focused more on global institutions and their headquarters, rather than in-country experiences. This study is, however, 1312being complemented by detailed country studies in Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, where we are looking at the international response from the other end of the telescope33. We have also focused in particular on the main technical agencies at the heart of the response, notably WHO, FAO, OIE, together with UNICEF, UNOCHA and others, as well as the coordinating efforts of UNSIC and others, including the World Bank. While this front-line work is the most visible, there has of course been substantial back-up support from different funding agencies, notably the European Commission, USAID and other bilateral donor governments, many of whom we talked to. However, what follows is necessarily qualified and partial, but hopefully useful, in particular in identifying challenges for the future. In the next sections, we will first examine the three main ‘outbreak narratives’ and how these have framed the debate, looking at what was proposed, what happened, and the tensions, dilemmas and trade-offs that have arisen. We will then move on to look at three alternative narratives, which have often been obscured or silenced by the mainstream debate, but which each have important implications for the future. Following this, we move to an analysis of some cross-cutting themes: institutional and organisational architectures, the role of expertise in the context of uncertainty and ignorance; and the (multiple) meanings and interpretations of security and the implications for ‘global governance’. Each of these themes – and the analysis of the findings as a whole – has important implications for the future – and in particular what a ‘One World, One Health’ approach might look like. 4. VETS AND VIRUSES:THE ANIMAL HEALTH RESPONSEAvian influenza is of course, in the first instance, a bird disease. H5N1 has affected billions of chickens, ducks and other poultry, as well as wild birds. For this reason the animal health sector legitimately argued that this was their territory. They had long dealt with avian influenza and Newcastle disease, a similar viral infection. Thus veterinarians legitimately claimed a place at the table, presenting a strong ‘birds first’ narrative – arguing that dealing with the disease in its avian form was the best initial step to avoid a human pandemic.Veterinarians have a long and distinguished professional tradition. This was their moment in the limelight – and the chance, as many saw it, to show that they knew how to stamp out a disease. The veterinary profession is associated with a range of organisations, the apex body being the OIE, an inter-governmental body I see avian flu as a chance to get things done we’d do anyway…We can use the PVS to position ourselves. Because this is a big crisis we can use it to do things that would be difficult otherwise, to get the money. The OIE sees itself as a big player in the avian influenza crisis34.Similarly, FAO has a long tradition of work in the animal health field, and its Animal Production and Health division is seen as a source of high quality technical advice and field support in this area35. Yet these organisations had been, for a long period, both under-funded and under-recognised. As the avian influenza story hit the headlines, those in charge recognised the opportunity both for funds and influence. One senior FAO informant put it:This put FAO really in the front line. We started making noise…The technical options are clear. Then there are institutional and policy solutions - we know the elements but how to make them work is difficult36.33 See http://www.steps-centre.org/ourresearch/avianflu.htmlwith governments represented through the heads of veterinary services, usually the Chief Veterinary Officer. Avian influenza was a major boon to the veterinary community. As one informant commented:34 Interview, London, 13 May 2008.35 http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/index.html36 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.The early period from late 2003 to early 2004 saw some awkward manoeuvring between individuals and organisations, and some hot politics. Who was going to get the lion’s share of the resources? Who was going to have the most influence? Whose organisation was going to drive the policy debate? These were difficult times, as OIE and FAO in particular fought it out. Inevitably strong personalities, personal histories and professional egos had an influence on the dynamics. But in the end, particularly once the Beijing pledging conference had confirmed substantial resources (even if some of them were loans and many recycled commitments), things settled down. There was enough to go round. A serious fight was not necessary. Indeed, a memorandum of understanding was confirmed between OIE and FAO which demarcated roles and responsibilities in a neat diagram. While the reality was more complex, a working – if occasionally tense – relationship has evolved which has enabled the veterinary community, at least in public, to speak with (more or less) one voice.Having a clear and coherent position – structured around a strong and convincing narrative – is essential in any policy process. This took some time coming, but has eventually emerged. The veterinary narrative essentially argues that the standard veterinary response – using a combination of culling, movement control and vaccination – to eliminate the disease is all that is required. This is enshrined in the OIE guidelines which specify ‘eradication pathways’ for different listed diseases. The reporting systems that are required of national veterinary authorities are ones 1514that ensure early warning and rapid response, and the challenge is more logistical, managerial and financial. For this reason, and with much justification, the OIE argued that the main investments needed are in the area of boosting the lagging capacity of veterinary services in the developing world, bringing them up to an acceptable standard. The PVS (Performance, Vision, Strategy) system developed by the OIE37 is the tool that defines what needs to be done, and the next steps are investment in capacity (labs, personnel training, equipment, vaccines etc.) which FAO, World Bank and other agency projects would take on. It was clear, it was simple and it allowed money to be spent. In other words it was a perfect response for the moment. With the Director General of OIE astutely manoeuvring the organisation into the mainstream, his influence in the debate grew substantially and, with this, the central role of professional, government vets. But how did this framing of the problem and response limit and constrain, and in some places, undermine the global effort? The construction of a particular view of the disease (one of poultry, mostly chickens) and how to deal with it (eradication/stamping out) reinforced the power and influence of certain individuals and organisations to the exclusion of others. The potential of endemicity, and the very different response requirements for Africa, for example, were often not considered. Similarly, the field level realities that farmers and field vets faced in places like Egypt, Indonesia or Vietnam were not part of the picture. This was a global response, facilitated by global organisations, with a globally-defined pathway of disease eradication. Although a membership organisation with equal voting rights, the OIE does not have a huge network of field offices. It relies on the reports of the CVOs, who are very much behoven to the organisation. The politics of knowledge, reporting and accountability are often fraught, with the centre, and its commissions and advisory groups, holding sway with debates usually dominated by European and North American concerns and interests. Here mass culling and eradication following an outbreak made sense – and indeed were imperative and worked in Turkey. The uniform manuals, protocols and procedures were thus seen to be the answer and so the ‘outbreak narrative’ dominated both diagnosis and prescription.Another strand of work by animal health specialists, this time mostly from the FAO, focused on dealing with the biosecurity of poultry production units and wet markets. Speculation was rife about the main pathways of spread among poultry – was it ‘backyard flocks’ or large industrial units? Was the disease spread through unregulated and unhygienic trade or through wild birds? No-one seemed to know the answer and any detailed case analysis suggested that multiple routes were possible38. But this uncertainty fed into a more political argument about cause and blame. Here different interests, beyond simple scientific concerns, came into play. Much of this centred on a vision of what a safe, modern poultry sector should look like. For many animal health specialists, particularly those from or trained in 37 http://www.oie.int/downld/Prep_conf_Avian_inf/A_Final_PVS.pdfavianflu.html39 See Sims and Narrod (undated) http://www.fao.org/avianflu/documents/key_ai/key_book_preface.htm39 See, Burgos and Burgos (2007); Beach et al (2007).40 See, McLeod (2008), McLeod et al (2006) or Rushton et al (2005), for example.41 http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2007/03/avian_flu_report.htmlEurope or North America, small scale poultry production and informal wet markets were seen as backward and in need of modernisation. Surely development, they argued, should be about eliminating these practices and assuring high levels of hygiene and safety. Powerpoint presentations show ‘before’ and ‘after’ scenes of Asian markets that had been ‘restructured’ according to the designs of different development programmes. This became the model of what to do and, as we saw in the opening case study, the approach adopted in Hong Kong and beyond. However, this approach had its downsides, particularly for poor producers and consumers39. Surely, others argued, development is not just about modernisation of production, but also about poverty reduction and improving livelihoods40. As played out within FAO, for example, this debate often found veterinarians and socio-economists at loggerheads on appropriate ways forward. In the wider debate lobby groups pushed hard to ‘prove’ that their constituency were not to blame. Wild bird enthusiasts, for example, attempted to demonstrate that it was trade not the migration of wild birds that was at fault41. Advocates of smallholder farming argued that the blame must lie at the door of industrial capitalist production systems. But were these positions based on evidence or more normative positions and personal preferences? Until recently at least, it seemed mostly the latter. Evidence that wild birds are carriers of H5N1 is widespread, although the causation of particular outbreaks often remains uncertain. Most now agree that unregulated large scale production can be a major biosecurity risk, but many large units equally have top quality biosecurity measures and can deal with outbreaks effectively and efficiently. Backyard flocks tend not to be significant factors in the spread of disease as they are largely kept in limited places and consumed at home, while medium size flocks kept in cramped conditions in urban settings appear to present a particular risk, along with unhygienic wet markets. As new research has found, in addition to the 3Ps (pigs, poultry and people), free grazing ducks in rice cropping areas present a particular challenge in some parts of Asia (Gilbert et al 2007; 2008; Hulse-Post et al 2005; Stum-Ramirez et al 2005). But these situations are often highly particular, and dependent on a wide range of factors from local ecological ones (such as whether ducks are part of the agro-ecosystem; the migratory routes of wild birds; the proximity to viral ‘hot spots’ and so on) to the structure of the industry (the relative importance of large and small production units and their location), the economics of production (whether poultry production makes money and what incentives exist to squeeze more chickens into smaller spaces) and the regulatory and policy environment (health and safety regulations and their enforceability in markets, movement and trade restrictions and so on). In other words, the idea that there is a single ‘before’ and a single ‘after’ technical or policy solution is impractical, unworkable and possibly dangerous. 1716The dangers of a simplistic narrative line have come home to roost (to coin a term) in a number of places. There seems to be a certain level of denial about this in some quarters. The need to present a success story of the veterinary response to keep the money flowing can overwhelm the ability to offer honest, balanced, sanguine assessments42. Thus in early 2008 a number of senior officials argued that the viral load was decreasing and that this was a direct result of veterinary interventions. But when probed, the evidence for these claims seemed to be lacking. Undoubtedly, successes have been achieved in Turkey and parts of the Balkans, but there are still big problems in Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Egypt, Nigeria, Vietnam and China (probably the largest global source of the virus), areas referred to by some as “the smoking guns”43. But we cannot be entirely sure about these or many other countries because of poor reporting and monitoring and we must not forget that the reporting is of outbreaks, not of viral load. Even in Vietnam, a poster-child for intensive vaccination campaigns, the problems of repeated recurrence of outbreaks eventually had to be admitted. So a mixed picture was emerging which challenged, in several important respects, the classic outbreak and response narratives so well presented and defended by the animal health sector. What happens when the disease becomes entrenched or endemic? This is currently probably the case in six countries worldwide – Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Egypt and Nigeria44. These are the places where most outbreaks are recorded (see figure 1) and where most human deaths occur. Should a different strategy be in place in these countries? We found it incredibly difficult to get an answer to this question. Some reacted defensively, arguing that good programmes are in place and that eradication remains the aim. Others disputed the definition of endemism and argued that the existing systems just need to be made to work better. Others said it demonstrated the need to do more and build capacity. A few, mostly with recent field experience in these countries, were, however, more sanguine, saying that they were doing their best, but often simply ‘chasing the virus’. Indonesia was seen as perhaps the most extreme case. As some pointed out, the Participatory Disease Surveillance approach had been enormously successful, finding the virus virtually everywhere. But how did knowing this affect responses? Here the limits of the standard veterinary response became evident. People talked of the difficulties of instituting culling campaigns in Sumatra where deep distrust of the state and the veterinary service persisted. They talked of the way people hid both themselves and their poultry as soon as a government official came anywhere near. They talked of the difficulties that arose when compensation was either not paid or paid late or inadequately following mass culling procedures with vets in white suits and protective gear. And they talked of the futility of poultry bans and market closures in large, unregulated metropolitan cities like Jakarta. One informant reflected: 42 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007a); (2008a); (2008b).43 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.44 Although doubts exist about the extent of entrenchment in Nigeria.Culling is always contentious. And without an effective compensation strategy you alienate people. In endemic situations does it make sense? The OIE approach is very much ‘first world’ – hordes of white suited professional vets going out, gassing poultry and disposing of them. But is this appropriate or realistic?45Another observed:A lot of countries remain very underprepared to face avian flu. The immediate response is to reach for the OIE guidelines. And the interpretation of these is problematic. In different contexts, they may not be appropriate. If you are a very poor country with limited logistical and other resources, culling may not be the answer. But very often they go straight for culling and ring culling…Ring culling assumes that AI is transferred through the environment, not through chains. The basic conceptual framework at a technical level is flawed. And the practical, logistical issues are difficult…in Egypt they culled, but did not deal with the disposal and cleaning up well. It just made the situation as bad. The disease persisted. It is money down the drain, and people distrust you too…In the panic of trying to respond – to do something, the idea is lost. We are trying to control a disease! The OIE Manual does not take account of the context. The context must include political, social, economic issues. But none of these are thought about…Culling has been done so badly. It has been so heavy-handed. They go into a village and wipe out everything. The average villager is scared shitless of the vets turning up. The last person they will turn to will be the public sector vet46.Another informant noted the mobilisation against veterinary measures in Lagos, Nigeria. When a ban on marketing was proposed by the authorities, women traders marched on the government offices, besieging them. The patron of the traders’ association turned out (apocryphally or not, we are not sure) to be the president’s wife. The ban was, not surprisingly, quickly overturned.Thus political, cultural, social and economic contexts matter. In Indonesia or Nigeria people have different livelihood concerns, and different perceptions of risk compared both to each other, and certainly to those based in Geneva, Rome or Washington. Even in Indonesia, with 112 confirmed human deaths to date, there are other, greater risks and threats to livelihoods – earthquakes, tsunamis, food prices and more. How does a poultry disease – one that seems ‘just like Newcastle’ – compete with these concerns in people’s risk framings? And, given the often difficult relation with technicians and agents of the state in many parts of the world, why should the public be expected to agree to their recommendations, especially if they arrive unannounced in a village dressed in protective suits and exterminate all their chickens, and so a significant portion of their livelihoods? These issues – particularly that of compensation and the problems of poor reporting – have certainly been topics of hot debate among the veterinary and public health community. Proper, effective and timely compensation is seen as a key factor in 45 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.46 Interview, UK, 11 March 2008.1918the response47 but in practice conditions on the ground are often unpredictable – and intertwined with more socio-cultural and political factors, such as historical relationships between citizens and the state, perceptions of and trust in expertise, the symbolic and cultural value of poultry, and the particular livelihood contexts of often very poor people. In the neat, technical narrative of the veterinary response, these factors rarely get a look in; and if acknowledged at all are seen as part of the problem: things to be got rid of in the strides towards a modern animal health system. So what are these points of contention, where a more thorough-going and searching, context-specific debate is required? Below, a few are listed which emerged repeatedly in our interviews:u What is to blame backyard birds or commercial flocks – or somewhere in between? u What are the implications for ‘restructuring’ and ‘biosecurity’? Can bans work? Who wins, who loses?u Wild birds, ducks or trade? Roles in spread and persistence in different agro-ecological and economic settings.u Disease dynamics – seasonality, cyclicity – and patterns of re-infection. Is elimination really feasible with large hot spots of ‘viral soup’ nearby?u Culling strategies: complete, ring, or not at all? What approaches to compensation? Is this a high cost but low return option in many places?u How effective is vaccination (and available vaccines)? Why is there cyclical re-infection despite thorough campaigns? u Does the PVS system help design the ideal vet system - for what and for whom?47 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/HPAI_Compensation_Final.pdfSo, in the course of the past five or more years, a series of important uncertainties have emerged, which add question marks, points of contention and awkward wrinkles to the neat and tidy veterinary outbreak (and stamp out) narrative. While often dismissed as marginal problems, we would argue that together these present some more fundamental challenges. Within the policy community associated with the veterinary response, these debates have started. We probed these and explored the uncertainties with a range of different people. But, inevitably, a recasting of the core framing presents difficult political, institutional and personal challenges for those at the centre of the network. These debates are certainly about science, but more importantly they are about power, money and position.What cuts across these debates is how complex, dynamic field experience in diverse socio-cultural and political contexts matters, and so disturbs the neat formulae (and manuals, protocols and pathways) offered from the international system. Also, and perhaps more challengingly, this experience suggests that in a number of (possibly increasing) places there is a need to move from a framing based on an outbreak and eradication mode – the standard, professional entrenched framing of veterinary science and practice – to a framing which acknowledges persistent, perhaps permanent, endemism – something that seems almost unthinkable for some. These tensions point to some simmering conflicts between different people and organisations within this actor-network, suggesting that the network is not as solid and water-tight as it sometimes appears. Fracture lines exist between the OIE and FAO, and indeed within these organisations, based on understandings of mandates and normative positioning (regulating veterinary standards according to universal global rules versus agriculture for development, livelihoods and poverty reduction, for example), and between head office and field vets and consultants, the latter experienced in the complications of the front line. And at the technical level there are disputes about some real uncertainties, about the structural and ecological drivers of the disease and its spread, and the efficacy and appropriateness of different intervention measures. These came to the surface, perhaps for the first time in public, at the OIE-FAO-WHO June 2007 technical meeting held in Rome48. Here, debates raged on the value of culling, particularly in increasingly endemic settings, with some tense stand-offs emerging in different sessions by some accounts.Many – on both sides of these disputes – reflected on this meeting as one of the high points of the previous few years. At last some of the real issues were being discussed openly; the institutional grandstanding and the squabbling over resources were put aside and the real issues were being debated (at least at the technical level – the lack of detailed socio-cultural and livelihood analysis remained starkly absent). Confronting uncertainties and debating alternatives must be a good thing. But in highly political and often tenuous policy processes it can be dangerous. Actor networks can fracture, tight narratives can unravel, and the political position and resource flows can be threatened. It was clear that this was in some people’s minds by mid 2007, as the 2006 pledged funds either were used up or failed to arrive. The media had lost interest, politicians were beginning to question whether this really was ‘the big one’ that they had to be concerned with, and now the scientists and technicians were questioning things. Was this going to turn out to be a very, very short window of opportunity for the veterinary profession to show its mettle, and get itself funded?  As we discuss in more detail below, by the end of 2007 at the Delhi conference, the actor network had once more closed ranks and put on a public face of unity and coherence. This for some seemed the last chance to rekindle support and interest. And there is nothing better than a new narrative to make this happen – for it was 48 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007d) http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//232786/ah671e.pdf 2120at the Delhi conference that the One World, One Health slogan was launched. Animal health was going to be on a par with the major players in the global scheme of things – human public health and ecosystem health (now often referred to in relation to climate change). 5. PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSESThe potential major public health consequences of an influenza pandemic were of course the rallying cry that in the end grabbed attention and raised resources. In terms of positioning in the wider actor network, the WHO is very much in the centre. While recognising the importance of the veterinary dimensions, many in the public health community have little knowledge or interest in the animal origins of the disease49. It is the public health consequences that are, for them, the major concern. The Global Influenza Programme in the WHO, established in 1952 and linked to a network of national influenza centres, collaborating centres and reference laboratories, has been central to this effort50. On-going influenza monitoring, virus sampling and regular flu shots have been part and parcel of the global public health programming for decades. The model is very much that of global public health system, linking national systems in a global network around public delivery for both prevention and cure. This is the model on which the WHO was built – public funds for public health: the classic global public goods model. As elsewhere in the medical profession a technical, medical, technology driven approach (drugs and vaccines and hospitals) competes with a more prophylactic, preventative, primary care approach, where non-pharmaceutical and community based interventions are seen to be the most effective. Yet both strands exist within a framework of public support and state structures, very much the post-war modernist vision of development.  While this vision has been disturbed and questioned of late, even with the new rhetoric of public private partnerships, of advance purchase agreements with pharma companies, of private medical provision and so on, much of the old statist model still persists. A rapid review of annual reports of the WHO over the years for example sees new languages and perspectives, but a remarkable persistence in vision and commitment to public provision on a global scale.49 However, within WHO a Veterinary Public Health unit existed within the Communicable Disease Department from 1949. A much larger programme was established in the American Region and it still is in place. The Inter-American joint Health and Agriculture Meetings at Ministerial Level (RIMSA) bring together high-level decision-makers from both agriculture and health, and recommendations are brought to the governing bodies of the Pan American Health Organization. See http://www.panaftosa.org.br/ for more details on this cross-sectoral collaboration.50 http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/en/ See: Hampson (1997) and Lazzari, S. and K. Stöhr (2004). Thus, for WHO, the overall narrative is firmly centred in the ‘outbreak’ mode. A potential major public health emergency is in the offing, it is argued. This could be on a par with 1918, or potentially worse. This requires a global response, with WHO in the lead, and substantial investment in technology (drugs, vaccines) and health systems (delivery, infrastructure). Within this, there are perhaps three overlapping strands identifiable, each associated with different groups within and outside WHO.First is the technological response. This focuses on drugs and vaccines and their delivery. As an informant from WHO noted, this is a standard response:Drugs, vaccines, it is inevitably the response. It is the way we operate in health systems. They are more tangible than behavioural responses. It is easier for a system to respond. It is easier to have a stockpile than tell people to wash their hands51.Yet the details have caused a massive debate which can only be touched on here. There are multiple views on what is the best strategy, many of them very strongly held. Medical opinion combines with logistical realism with commercial pressure, and it is difficult to pick apart the rationales and influences52. The WHO has stock-piled donated anti-viral drugs for rapid containment purposes, while the US has about 70 million treatment courses of anti-virals in federal and state stockpiles53. Elsewhere, no-one seems to know how far this policy has been implemented, as both the costs of getting hold of anti-virals such as oseltamivir and the political challenge of defining who is worth protecting have constraints. And then there are questions of efficacy. Studies in Norway in early 2008 highlighted the possibility that the stockpiled drugs would not work, as oseltamivir resistance to seasonal influenza (H1N1) was detected54. Many of the drugs stockpiled in the early period of the crisis are now nearing the end of their shelf life, and big decisions are pending relating to their replacement; a subject on which medical opinion is divided. Vaccination policy has been especially controversial55. While regular, seasonal influenza vaccination has been recommended by the WHO, uptake even in the west has been limited. The challenges of isolating seasonal influenza viral strains, manufacturing the vaccine and making a profit from it have been well documented (Poland and Marcuse, 2004).  Around 16 manufacturers globally are currently in relatively advanced stages of producing H5N1 vaccines through a variety of egg and cell based manufacturing techniques56. WHO has committed to stockpiling 50 million doses, and the European Commission has recently licensed 51 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.52 European Vaccine Manufacturers (2005).53 http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/biz-plan/news/apr2508iom.html54 Lackenby et al (2008) and see http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/oseltamivir_summary/en/index.html. See also Lipsitch et al (2007); de Jong et al (2005).55 See: Fedson (2003, 2005); Monto (2006); Subbarao and Joseph (2007); Flahault et al (2006).56 http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/WHO_HSE_EPR_GIP_2008_1/en/index.html2322GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccine Prepandrix57. Yet global estimates suggest that, given current manufacturing capacity, only 500 million doses would be available 12 months after a pandemic outbreak. There are hopes that the use of vaccine adjuvants to reduce the required dose will increase capacity (Yamada et al 2008). But would this be sufficient in the timeframe and on the scale of a global pandemic? Who would make a pandemic vaccine? Where? Who would have access and who would not? What financing models would work? These are tough questions touching on intellectual property, business models and corporate profits, as well as medical ethical and moral dilemmas. They are such sensitive discussions that they do not often occur in polite conversation. The current realities put into question all the worthy commitments to global health equity, as the reality is clear – only a few, relatively rich people will have access to any vaccine, given the current global distribution of manufacturing capacity, the costs of production and distribution and the lack of cold chain and other facilities in many parts of the world. And even the rich, northern elite will be lucky to get anything if the pandemic spreads quickly with dramatic effects on economies, transport and mortality. In the end it may be only politicians, the military and some health professionals who benefit. But of course no one knows the details of the future prospects and consequences of a human pandemic, and that’s the point. While the debate can often seem very dense and technical with long discussions of genomic sequencing, antibody responses, vaccine adjuvants and so on, most people we talked to, when pushed, said that they had no idea what might work and what might happen. Of course this is not an argument for doing nothing, and indeed the substantial investments in research on vaccines of different sorts (both into types – RNA, killed, attenuated, subunit) and production methods (traditional egg cultures, cell based and so on) may well pay off, as well as the commitments to ensuring a more widely distributed manufacturing capacity is in place. These programmes are absorbing substantial funds, with uncertain pay-offs. For example, the European Commission’s high profile research programme on influenza, costed at over EUR 65 million58, has most of these resources invested in upstream vaccine research by partnerships of university departments and biotech and pharma companies across Europe59. Similarly, support to new manufacturing capacity in the developing world, while backed by private finance, is being supported by public funds. To date, nearly 100 low and middle income countries have told WHO that they want financial support for increasing access to a pandemic vaccine, and in April 2007 WHO approved initial grants of $2.5m each to six manufacturers from Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam60. 57 The Lancet Infectious Diseases - Vol. 8, Issue 7, July 2008, Page 409. The WHO stock-pile relates to rapid containment only, but has been a recommendation from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization to stockpile 150 million doses for rapid containment and emergency personnel in low and middle income countries.58 European Commission, Influenza Research EU funded projects 2001-7, Luxembourg 2007 (EUR2282)59 http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/influenza/projects_en.html60 http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7600/925-a?ck=nck. See the WHO’s Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to Increase Vaccine Supply (2006) at http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/DocsPDF06/863.pdf.But all of this is about the future, some of it potentially very long term. At the moment, what is the technological front-line? So-called H5 ‘pre-pandemic’ vaccines are available, but while good as a sales pitch for certain big pharma companies, they only provide some generic immunity to viruses resembling the one that may (or may not) be a pandemic strain. ‘Pre-pandemic’, as some informants pointed out, is a misnomer – as until the pandemic happens, we don’t know what to immunise against, so this is a potentially expensive guessing game. Of course, the ‘holy grail’, as one scientist put it, is a universal vaccine which provides a combined response to a dozen or more influenza virus types, but this seems a long way off. As with other difficult-to-treat diseases, the influenza virus is incredibly variable, prone to rapid change in properties and difficult to pin down with a vaccination strategy which is not continuously adapting - seasonal virus vaccine strains must be re-assessed each year in each hemisphere. Indeed, many argue that the ‘silver bullet’ solution is a false promise, providing funds for expensive labs but little else. Such sceptics argue that the only feasible vaccine solution would have to be based on a global commitment to an infrastructure for universal provision of season influenza vaccine, and undertaking that would cost substantial resources and would have to be backed by public money on a massive scale. As several people pointed out, there are nowhere near six billion syringes and needles, let along vaccine vials, being produced or even stored right now, and no likelihood that this will happen any time in the near future.In sum the technology fix narrative strand – addressing the outbreak through solely technological means – looks shaky when probed. Yet this contrasts with the up-beat assessments by commercial outfits with pipeline research and development investments and public-philanthropic funding commitments of the Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust and others. Most technicians and researchers admit the challenges freely, but those in the core policy and business circuits are more reluctant, given the investments and commitments being made. The focus on technology-as-solution is thus backed by big players in a strong, mutually reinforcing network. Cynics point to the ‘revolving door’ between public agencies such as the WHO, philanthropic organisations and big pharma, and how a particular version of the outbreak narrative feeds into support for commercial interests and particular research efforts61. But such arguments are countered strongly by pointing out that synergies between public, private and philanthropic efforts are essential given the scale of the challenge, and that the efforts in technology development are for the long-term – and in the scale of things where public money is spent (the most frequently mentioned of course were defence commitments in Iraq or Afghanistan), this is small fry62.61 There was comment for example when Klaus Stöhr, formerly head of the Global Influenza Programme and a staunch supporter of global vaccine programmes left for Novartis to head up their vaccine R and D (see WHO flu chief leaves for Novartis, http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/43504/). 62 The war in Iraq is calculated to cost $341 million per day; the UK’s NHS budget was £90 billion in 2007; in 2008 the UK’s MoD announced a contract price of £3.2 billion for two new aircraft carriers.2524A second public health narrative focuses on non-pharma options. This emphasises public education and communication, as well as measures such as ‘social distancing’ in the face of an outbreak to reduce infection and mortality. The assumption is that the technological fixes will not be available or sufficient, so the most efficacious response may be through changing behaviour. A variety of ‘knowledge, attitude and practice’ surveys were done63, in the standard vein of public health research, and with all the problems associated with them. In addition, a variety of communication messages for public education were developed in different parts of the world64. With funds from the Japanese government, UNICEF had led these efforts, with WHO and a number of NGOs involved. UNICEF’s main concern, starting in early 2006, has been changing human behaviour to prevent animal-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus. These programmes are in a familiar mode for UNICEF and other learning and social change health programming, focusing on a few standard health messages (wash hands, cook meat properly, don’t let kids work or play with chickens and so on). An informant from UNICEF explained the history:Following Beijing, it was identified that communications were going to be key for both prevention and control, and an inter-agency meeting was organised in Geneva with WHO, FAO, UNICEF, and others from the regional offices…The result was distilled into the four main points - reporting, cooking, separating, hand-washing. So the messages were identified after consultation with the technical agencies as reasonably simple, attainable and effective and feasible actions very much with the backyard farmers in mind65.Only now is UNICEF moving towards pandemic mitigation, which involves prescriptions and routines for health etiquettes, quarantine, social distancing and so on. In the developed world at least, this approach received a boost in February 2007 when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with the Departments of Commerce, Transport, and Health and Human Services, published ‘Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States – Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions’66. This involved plans for closing schools, cancelling public gatherings, organising work leave, tele-working strategies and so on. At the time, it was seen as an acceptance of the limitations of the pharmaceutical response, a realisation that the pandemic would hit months before any vaccine was available, and that the only other prophylaxes – antivirals – were in limited supply, of unproven efficacy, and essentially untested in a pandemic scenario. Hot on the heels of this move came two historical studies funded by the US National Institutes of Health. One found that in the 1918 pandemic, rapid social containment measures had cut peak weekly death rates in some US cities by up to half. In the most extreme case, the peak mortality rate in Philadelphia was eight times that of St. Louis, which had been quicker to implement social control measures (Hatchett et al 2007). The other study (Bootsma and Ferguson 2007) used mathematical models to reproduce the pattern of the 1918 pandemic and found that cities that had relaxed their restrictions after the peak of the pandemic often saw the re-emergence of infection.Now – in the US at least – the ramifications of twenty-first century style social distancing are beginning to be better understood. There are optimistic aspirations towards communities developing their ‘social capital’, and of all households being rich and organised enough to hold six weeks food in reserve. But what happens if there is mass panic? The social, political and security consequences remain largely unaddressed. In other parts of the world, such ‘social distancing’ approaches may not work. As one informant put it “It’s all very well having this simple idea of everybody staying at home, but if it’s ten in a room, in a home that is no distance from the next, it doesn’t really make any sense. We need ideas that are going to work”67. Another observed: It is accepted…that containment will not work. In all countries with humanitarian crises, governance tends to be weak. How can such strategies be implemented? Even in Europe. We are already moving to the next step – response. But what realistically can be done? Some basic capacity issues, yes. Keep the electricity functioning, ensure some basis services. This is important. But vaccines and so on? No. Basically you are on your own. Sit indoors and hope for the best!68But in the professional worlds of vets, medics and agronomists, the advertising buyers, copywriters and vague creative types that make up the communications department don’t get much space at the table. One informant commented “UNICEF is not an equal in the interagency debate”69. Another observed:We see it at the international meetings. The whole day can be very animal focused - vaccination, culling and so on - with just an hour maybe at the end to talk about the social aspects - things like closing schools, transport issues. The vets are not keen to accept that the threat of a human pandemic has driven much of the momentum, action and funding. If it was just an animal threat, we would not have seen anything like this response70.63 For example in Egypt (http://www.comminit.com/en/node/223876) and Cambodia (http://www.foodsecurity.gov.kh/docs/ENG/KAP-Surway-Evaluation-Poultry.pdf).64 http://www.unicef.org/influenzaresources/65 Interview, New York, 19 June 2008.66 USA Department Of Health And Human Services (2007).67 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.68 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.69 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.70 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.It is also the case that the nature of UNICEF’s avian influenza funding created its own dynamics. First, it was specifically targeted at East Asia. Second, the distinct and separate nature of UNICEF’s initial funding stream (from the government 2726of Japan) meant that UNICEF was to some (albeit small) degree made remote from the other agencies. Third, when the Japanese money ran out there was, as someone put it, “a huge sucking sound”71, and there are now worries all round that a large expectation has been generated that will not be fulfilled, and that the communications component of the response has not been regularised and bedded-in.Nevertheless, avian influenza communications programmes have raised awareness levels significantly in many places that there is a new deadly chicken disease that can affect humans. Specific, most often domestic behaviours, such as cooking procedures and hand washing, have proved relatively easy to influence, but more detailed knowledge and behaviours about what should be done in the case of more animal-focused activities such as reporting and separation have proved more difficult. And only now, in 2008, are the most obvious social and behavioural aspects of infection and disease spread, such as gender, being investigated (Velasco et al 2008).No systematic studies, to our knowledge, have really delved into the understandings of people’s risk perceptions and how cultural practices might affect their responses. The practice of drinking duck’s blood, common in parts of Asia, was looked upon by some with revulsion and horror, rather than as something that had to be understood in embedded cultural terms. Similarly, the social, economic and prestige associated with birds in places like Thailand, where prize fighting cocks are very much valued, was not seen as central. Indeed, when people rejected the health messages of different programmes in Sumatra, one informant – a communications professional – talked of the ‘hocus pocus’ witchcraft involved72. The people were seen as backward and in need of modernisation, and their fatalism about death and disease something that could be overcome through education and propaganda. That it failed seemed to be a surprise, only acting to reinforce cultural prejudices. Thus the non-pharma interventions have been, with a few notable exceptions73, largely constructed around a fairly top-down, instrumentalist version of behaviour change, which in the context of a pandemic setting would have to be enforced. Understanding alternative narratives of the disease and its impact have, as in other approaches already discussed, not been a priority.A third important public health narrative emphasises less the measures to be taken but more the system within which the measures are supposed to be delivered. This is the classic ‘health systems’ approach: it is argued that with a well-functioning system, responsive to local needs and supplying high quality care, and with appropriate technological back-up, any outbreak, whether pandemic influenza or something else, can be dealt with. This is similar to the stance taken by the veterinarians, as we have seen. With decades of underfunding and with many national health systems in a flux of quasi-privatisation, pandemic influenza resources could, it is 71 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.72 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.73 See http://www.comminit.com/en/avianinfluenza.htmlargued, help rebuild some of these systems which are currently in deep disrepair. This is a classic global public goods response, contributing to proofing the world against a future pandemic (cf. Smith and MacKellar 2007).And, like the vets, the medical professionals in WHO and beyond know what a good health system should look like: structured, ordered, well resourced, state funded, and run by doctors (something similar to Germany, France, the UK, or Sweden). Information, prediction and early warning is key for this to work well. And a responsive system which allows the right response to happen at the right time, in the right place. For this reason, and as discussed further in section 5, substantial investment in information systems and surveillance is seen as critical. Of course most of the world is not like western Europe and the ideal health system probably doesn’t exist anywhere. Whether it is a desirable or achievable goal is also widely questioned, given the realities on the ground, where hybrid public-private-traditional systems exist in highly unregulated and poorly resourced settings, and where, increasingly, services can be purchased in pharmacists and on the Internet (Bloom et al 2007). Again, as with the veterinary response, when probed, no-one quite knows what will work where and when – and for whom. The basic models are based on North American or European responses, with different emphases on technological, non-pharma and health system responses, yet reality often acts to undermine and challenge these idealised narratives in practice. There are some big interests at play here – and it is not surprising that large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pushing technological solutions, hoping for public funding to offset their commercial risks. For the WHO, and others making the case for global public health, the avian influenza crisis came at a good time. The wider public health narrative served institutional purposes well. As a UN agency whose core resources had declined over time, and whose primacy of position had been overtaken by other initiatives such as the Global Fund or UNAIDS, building on the long-term influenza programme and undoubted experience and expertise offered an opportunity to present WHO as the core organisation able to respond to the potential crisis. The then Director General, Lee Jong-Wook, made the case and galvanised early support from the UN system, and from the Secretary General in particular. The International Health Regulations, seen as a revalorisation of the WHO with new powers to operate at a global level, were approved with the avian flu crisis providing an important spur to action. Funds to the WHO started to flow and information and virus tracking systems, as well as laboratory and vaccine facilities, were planned and built. Lee however died suddenly in May 2006, and a successor had to be found. Margaret Chan was appointed, whose experience of successfully dealing with the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong was seen as a key factor in her appointment. She quickly saw the importance of the avian influenza issue, and, drawing on her experience, backed the WHO avian influenza initiatives.  2928However, as discussed at greater length in section 8, the international coordination of the avian flu response changed over time, particularly within the UN system. When David Nabarro – a British medical doctor who had previously worked at WHO, and before that at DFID – was appointed by the Secretary General to head UNSIC, the centre of gravity shifted from Geneva to New York. There was also pressure to make the response more coordinated and coherent, with technical agencies across the UN (notably WHO, FAO, UNICEF, but also WFP, UNOCHA and others) and outside (notably OIE and the World Bank, but also others) speaking off one sheet. As discussed in section 8, this was no easy task. And to this day, there are those in WHO who resent this move towards cross-agency coordination. This surely was a WHO mandate, they argue, and why was the Secretary General and UNDG, and increasingly the World Bank, none of them health specialists, meddling in this when the obvious technical capacity sits within the mandated UN agency? This resentment has persisted and coloured some initiatives and efforts. The DG, Margaret Chan, however has regularly risen above these usually local wrangles of territory and resources, and committed the WHO publicly to the more joined up cause, often emphasising the non-health aspects of avian influenza in speeches, not always to the delight of her colleagues. This changing and sometimes ambivalent positioning of the WHO in the policy process is central to understanding both the process and its outcomes. The vision of the WHO, with new International Health Regulations under its belt, as the guarantor of global health security is a strong one, articulated forcefully in both numerous publications and many of the interviews we conducted. The security discourse is important, as discussed in section 9. The language is often telling. This highlights the role of cross-border intervention, with medics being the army fighting the war against the disease with the weapons of vaccines and drugs. But often this is wrapped up in a higher, more worthy, moral language of ‘responsibility’ and ‘rights’, equally important dimensions of the WHO vision. Unlike perhaps the veterinary world, where issues of capability, rights and access don’t get a look in, these are very much part of the discourse in the public health world. Yet in both the military and the access/rights-focused metaphors and linguistic turns, a rather benevolent, top-down, we-know-best version comes across. As several informants put it “you have to remember this place (referring to the WHO) is full of doctors”. But there is also humility amongst the bravado. In particular, a number of more senior figures commented on the failures of the public health community globally to respond to the HIV/AIDS pandemic effectively. This is a scar on the conscience of some, and something that, as committed professionals, they do not want to repeat. Yet, at the same time, a familiar refrain is that they do not want to repeat the UNAIDS solution. The UNAIDS building, with its fine public sculptures and modern architecture sits opposite the WHO building. It is regarded by those in the WHO with a mixture of disdain and envy. Envy for the profile and resources, but disdain for the waste, lack of technical skills and, in some people’s assessment, a poor record of achievement. Those involved in the avian influenza response are proud that they have developed a leaner, more efficient and technically informed response, which does not need a fancy new building, but can build on the in-house capacities and experiences of the WHO in particular. However, there is concern evident in the corridors of the WHO and other agencies working on the public health side. The longer the pandemic doesn’t happen, the more questions are raised about avian influenza as a human, public health priority. Surely there are other more pressing problems – what about the big killers like malaria or diarrhoeal diseases? Is this the best way to spend money, some ask? This is a real dilemma, and one that again raises the spectre of shameful negligence on the scale of HIV/AIDS which no-one wants to repeat. As things stand, a wide range of uncertainties persist – from the big unknown (will a pandemic happen at all, and if so when?) to the specific unknowns (about vaccination and drug efficacy, about behaviour change in situations of crisis and so on). Again, rather echoing the on-going debates about other responses to epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, debates rage on whether a treatment focused approach (drugs/vaccines) makes sense, or whether preventative approaches (behaviour change) have the best results, or whether both have a role. Should the response be led by the state, or can private providers and community action offer better and cheaper solutions? Or can some form of partnership be developed that transcends these boundaries? As we have seen, different narratives about cause and effect, problem and solution compete in the public health field, but all respond to a characteristic ‘outbreak narrative’ and are confined to a fairly technical, formulaic response, with uncertainties of all sorts pervading. But the big question remains: is this enough? Are the combined measures of vaccine and drug development and stockpiling, behaviour change and public education and health system improvement really increasing the world’s resilience to uncertain future zoonotic threats? Who is left out – and where? What alternative narratives are obscured by the dominant framing, and what structural inequalities are sustained or provoked by the political interests that prevail? These are questions that are picked up in section 10. First, however, we take a look at a third major narrative surrounding avian flu: pandemic preparedness and emergency response.31306. PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESSAnother strand of activity, again firmly centred on an ‘outbreak narrative’, focuses on pandemic preparedness. This is much larger than the public health response, and links to wider issues of economic risk management, business continuity planning, civil contingency and emergency response. In this narrative, the worst needs to be prepared for…and it could be very bad. With food supplies restricted, energy systems disrupted and the Internet down, widespread panic and fear could grip any population faced with overloaded hospitals, sick or absent medical staff, numerous corpses, and military-style containment measures. Of course no-one knows the likelihood of any of this happening, and many regard it as highly unlikely given the way the H5N1 strain has been evolving74. Nevertheless pandemic influenza is high on the risk registers of national security agencies, and prime ministers and presidents don’t want to mess up. As one informant described:This global pandemic response element is being driven by the US, Japan, Europe, Australia of course, but it is a genuine developmental problem – it will be the developing world that will be most hit. We all have to have pandemic preparedness. the first line of defence is seen to be the developing world75.The US in particular has taken this side of things very seriously. To date it has been untouched by the avian disease, and SARS only got as far as Canada. Yet preparing for a pandemic has been highlighted as a major priority by the Bush administration over the last few years, and substantial resources have been spent across government and business. Local government and city authorities, Wall Street and the corporate world, and the military, have all undertaken big simulations, and made significant investments. Significant too is a different culture of threat, fear and anxiety in the US, where safety and security are seen as a paramount, especially since the attack on the twin towers in September 2001. As one informant explained:What drove it from the White House was the national strategy. That document is our best shot at identifying the totality of what a pandemic would bring. By having our Department of Homeland Security focussed on the critical issues – by getting the department of aviation to work with the airline industry for example – it really is looking at the totality of it, going far beyond the human outbreak, far beyond the animal outbreak, but at the same time we have to realise its limitations76.74 Horimoto et al (2004).75 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.76 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.The UN system has taken the pandemic threat seriously too. In 2005, the Secretary General, then Kofi Annan, called a high level meeting and urged a cross agency response, with a central coordinating unit based in the UN Development Group at UNDP. The first concern was internal: how was the UN going to respond? What was going to be required of the UN system in the event of a major outbreak? How was the UN going to ‘survive to serve’ – to keep its own people alive and healthy in order to help others around the world? This was, for some, thinking the unthinkable. Many in the agencies dismissed this as alarmism: they were busy people, they had their own projects to get on with. But others in senior administrative positions have increasingly taken the pandemic preparedness agenda on board. Consequently agencies across the UN have prepared plans, and a subset has undertaken simulation exercises to test these plans. A number of cross-UN exercises have been undertaken to test out what might happen under different circumstances. UNOCHA, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and its specialised Pandemic Influenza Contingency (PIC) team, has taken the lead within the UN system, supported by the World Food Programme and others. They have developed a number of training modules and have worked intensively with UN country teams across the world77. They have a ‘UN system pandemic preparedness map’ and indicators to show the level of preparedness around the world, showing the vast majority of the world to be ‘less or medium prepared’78.Many involved in this effort are brutally honest about the level of preparedness. The world is definitely not, they say. It might be more so now than before, but if a pandemic emerges quickly, is identified late and spreads fast with characteristics that result in high mortalities, the plans and preparations may not be worth much: Our assumption is that systems will fail. No early warning, or a cull of chickens… We simulate two weeks of confusion. We try to be realistic. Total a six week period. At the end of the first week – identification of a novel virus. Containment is on-going. Week two - containment fails. Week three - three countries are swamped. Week four – it’s a global pandemic.79  77 http://ocha.unog.ch/drptoolkit/PSimulations.html78 http://www.un-pic.org/pic/web/index.aspx79 Interview, Geneva, 6 March 2008.80  Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.Another informant commented:Given the complexities of the pandemic, given the resources that would be required to deal with the severe one, we will never prepare.80Yet everyone also stresses forcefully, this should not mean we just adopt a fatalistic complacency and do nothing. For this reason, they argue, investing in pandemic preparedness planning and developing contingency arrangements and emergency systems are essential. These are useful anyway, as they could be used for other disaster situations, whether an earthquake, flood or terror attack. Certain principles 3332apply: clear information systems, short chains of command, centralised decision making, clear areas of responsibility, stockpiled resources which can be mobilised at speed and a rehearsed pattern of action which can be unrolled quickly. In practice, of course, the experience has been mixed81. According to the UNSIC/World Bank Progress Report (2007), 120 pandemic preparedness plans have been developed around the world. Most of these have been drafted by cross-ministry groups, often under a senior official with political clout – if not the president or prime minister at least their deputies. This is seen as an important success: there is political buy-in, cross-government coordination and an agreed plan. But a little probing suggests that this may be more form than substance. Most plans are long, turgid documents, developed from templates elsewhere. ‘Useless’, ‘not worth the paper they are written on’, ‘creating a false sense of security’ were some of the comments we heard – including from those who helped prepare them. And, although they may exist on paper, most have not been tested at all. Thus all sorts of grand plans exist, but there is a certainty that they won’t happen in practice. “How can you expect hundreds of trucks to be mobilised to transport food to containment areas when there are no stockpiles of either food or fuel?” someone asked82. A few countries have carried out detailed simulations of their plans under a range of circumstances, including the UK83, but even in these contexts (rich, well resourced), there is some doubt about the plans’ likely effectiveness. Getting engagement with planning for the unknown is difficult, even within the UN system. As one informant put it “it’s so hard to get people to focus on an emerging pandemic. They say ‘Leave me alone.I have a programme to run’”84.So, despite the doubts and concerns, the pandemic preparedness narrative continues to take up a lot time and effort - and a large chunk of the global resources. With avian influenza framed as a ‘crisis’ or an ‘emergency’, far more resources were mobilised than if it was cast as a development problem of poor people’s poultry. The crisis and emergency framing has its advantages – there is urgency, money flows and political commitment at the highest level is there. But it has its downsides: the money is fickle, short-term and tied to rapid response and timeframes; it can create distorting incentives and lack of strategic thinking; people are employed on short-term contracts with short-term money; and, because it is under the detailed scrutiny of the political masters, it can be used in ways that technically may not make sense to meet short-term political objectives.The world of crises and emergencies is thus very different to the highly technical, often quite academic, cultures of the veterinary and public health responses discussed above. Across the avian influenza response the mix and interactions have not always been easy, resulting in frustration, competition and confusion at times. Within the UN, for example, the humanitarian and emergency arm think in very different ways. They draw from military planning, logistics management and operations thinking, not technical understandings of epidemiology, ecology or economics. They focus on action and results, quickly and efficiently, rather than long-term solutions to complex development challenges. The language is of ‘emergency campaigns’ and ‘surge responses’. It has quite a gung-ho, muscular feel to it, which sometimes does not go down well in other settings. A number of fairly standard disaster and emergency systems have been adopted and adapted for the avian influenza response. From the US forest service, the ‘all-hazards approach’ has been pushed by USDA and USAID in their programming around the world85. The investment in surveillance, information and emergency response systems has been substantial, with emergency operations rooms installed in both FAO and WHO to help coordinate response to outbreaks. In the WHO a former underground cinema room has been converted into a state-of-the-art emergency room86 – the SHOC room . Around a large table a set of screens provide up to the minute information on the unfolding of different outbreaks and the responses being made. Banks of computers sit behind the room, with intercom and video link systems allowing connections with key experts in different parts of the globe. On the day we visited avian influenza outbreaks featured prominently, alongside cholera, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever. It is an impressive set-up. At the FAO another room, the Crisis Management Centre (CMC)87, furnished in bright orange and known informally as the Guantanamo room, offers the same service and links to the WHO centre through daily tele/video conferences.  But how effective will this impressive infrastructure be if a pandemic really occurs? It is clear that the neat Phase 1 to 6 pattern of a slow and paced evolution of a pandemic may not occur as the manuals suggest88. The WHO pandemic 81 See Fauci (2006); Coker and Mounier-Jack (2006); Mounier-Jack and Coker (2006); Webby and Webster (2003).82 Discussion, Geneva, 6 March 2008.83 http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/pandemicflu/exercises.aspx84 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.85 http://www.fs.fed.us/global/aboutus/dmp/welcome.htm86 The J.W. Lee Strategic Health Operations Centre, http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/84/10/06-011006/en/87 http://www.fao.org/askfao/viewquestiondetails.do?questionId=5161388 See: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/pandemic/en/. The six phases identified by WHO move from an inter-pandemic period (Phase 1: No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals. If present in animals, the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low; Phase 2: No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a circulating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease) to a pandemic alert period (Phase 3: Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact (“person-to-person”). Phase 4: Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-human transmission but spread is highly localized, suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans. Phase 5: Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread still localized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to humans, but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial pandemic risk)) to a pandemic period (Phase 6: Pandemic: increased and sustained transmission in general population).(see http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/GIP_2005_5Eweb.pdf for the Global Pandemic Preparedness Plan, WHO, 2005).3534preparedness documents show how early detection results in rapid containment and a slowing of the pandemic in Phases 3 and 4, allowing time to get ready for the major consequences of the outbreak in the full global pandemic phase. These carefully produced booklets and presentations are, however, open to some questioning – and not a little derision. As many point out, we may not see a Phase 3 or 4 at all, as a real pandemic strain will spread in days to every major city in the world. And by Phase 5 or 6, countries will “be on their own”. Ideas of containment are accepted as wishful thinking by many, with some finding echoes of Cold War thinking. Without extreme and highly disciplined military force, restricting a population to a small area would be impossible. Few governments would be able to enforce such a strategy, even if it made sense from the epidemiological point of view. When asked what he would do if a pandemic occurred, a senior official at the WHO answered succinctly: “head for the hills”. It was not a joke. So, deep uncertainties remain – about information accuracy, prediction possibilities and response strategies – and no-one know quite what will happen when. Will we be faced with a damp squib ‘slow-burn’ epidemic, or a global catastrophe? Or will nothing happen in our lifetimes?An important question we return to below is whether this collective global response has resulted in a safer world, more resilient to future disease episodes – either in pandemic outbreak mode or not. We asked this question to a number of people involved in the international response to avian influenza and there were two views – yes…and no. These reflect institutional positions, technical knowledge and personal outlooks, but, more fundamentally, we suggest they reflect an important contrast in perspective between those who see a risk management approach as increasing safety and resilience, and those who argue that recognising uncertainty and ignorance as central requires a different approach – and indeed that conventional approaches to risk management may even make things riskier. We will return to this debate in section 10. In the meantime, we want to turn to some alternative narratives that have been obscured by the dominant outbreak narratives discussed in the previous sections. For it is these – often discussed on the margins by those outside the main circuits of power and influence – that may offer insights into what has been missed in the mainstream response, and pose challenges to the way things have been done to date.7. MISSING DEBATES, ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVESLooking across the three main outbreak narratives discussed so far, we have to ask what is missing, obscured, hidden or blocked? Is there a set of alternative narrative framings that emerge from the margins as critiques of the mainstream? Rosenberg (1992) has argued that epidemics can be explained in at least three radically different ways – contamination (focused on disease transmission), configuration (focused on disease context) and disposition (related to the individual carrier of the disease). Each is important, and each has had different influences on our understandings of, and responses to, public health over time, he argues. Yet, the contamination strand, and its emphasis on disease outbreaks, laboratory diagnosis and a treatment response has dominated at least since the mid-twentieth century. As we have seen, this has certainly been true in the case of the avian influenza example, but what about other explanations of epidemics? Arguments centred on disposition have been important – the ‘super-spreaders’ of recent epidemiological models have often focused on particular individuals. Outbreak narratives often involve an important individual – from Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary) in 1907 in the USA to the doctor who carried SARS to Hong Kong’s Metropole Hotel in 2003 – and, although no single individual or group has been identified as a ‘super-spreader’ in the epidemiological sense in the unfolding drama of avian influenza, certain groups have been pinpointed as being more significant in the spread – and blamed for it. Thus, backyard chicken farmers and wet market traders in Asia – and the Chinese perhaps in particular – have been fingered. The focus on ‘risk groups’ and particular agents of spread may remove emphasis from the wider context, the epidemic’s ‘configuration’ in Rosenberg’s terms. In the welter of activity, funds, people and acronyms that the mainstream ‘outbreak’ and ‘contamination’ approaches have generated, it is easy to ignore alternative framings. Some of these are presented, not as alternatives or challenges to the mainstream views, but as complements, additions and nuances. Often they are articulated together with the mainstream narratives, but more as a polite add-on, a superficial dressing, or an acknowledgement of alternative views, before proceeding with the main argument. These different framings are not always presented by radical opponents of the mainstream. Many of the most articulate advocates of these views work within or for the core organisations at the centre of the actor-network. Thus the relationship between these narratives and what has been discussed before is complex. We suggest, however, that they each, in different ways, offer insights that are not fully dealt with in the mainstream outbreak narratives, and present interesting challenges to the way an international response to avian influenza – or indeed other zoonotic diseases under the ‘One World, One Health’ banner – needs to be thought about. This section, therefore, addresses three alternative narratives. The first focuses on the causes of the disease and its dynamics; the second focuses on 3736the way normative concerns about poverty, livelihoods and equity are treated; and the third focuses on questions of access and global governance. In different ways, each suggests challenges for the One World, One Health agenda which are not immediately obvious in the mainstream approaches discussed so far.DYNAMIC DRIVERS AND UNDERLYING CAUSES OF NEW DISEASESThe outbreak narrative and associated emergency/crisis response tend to focus on the outbreak event, not the underlying causes. Information systems are based on reporting outbreaks, not changing epidemiological dynamics, for instance. And responses tend to hone in on the diseased organism with treatment measures, or the diseased area with disease control/eradication measures. This applies to both the human and veterinary response framings. This is replicated in the emergency response which focuses on mitigating the worst impacts of an outbreak, both ‘at source’ and after it has spread. At least in the way that the narratives are framed, these are fairly standardised, universal responses which are ‘rolled out’ across the world according to plans, programmes, strategies backed up by protocols, manuals and regulations, and overseen by a technically-equipped and well resourced, benevolent ‘international system’. This universal, global vision is very much part of the contemporary rhetoric – and indeed frames the One World, One Health slogan. We are all in it together; we know how to deal with; it requires coordination and coherence.Scientific interventions – and models of different sorts in particular – act to reinforce this framing. So computer models of disease spread for example show clearly how localised, at source eradication or containment efforts are critical in preventing a global pandemic. This justifies cross-border intervention, under the concept of ‘responsibility to protect’ to use the current jargon89. But of course models are just models and dependent on often quite heroic assumptions – like diseases spreading in concentric circles, that borders of countries and districts don’t matter, that people are prevented from moving and so on. Surreptitiously and insidiously these ideas have an impact on policy framing, such is the power (and simplicity) of modelling. The 2005 models published simultaneously in Nature and Science (Ferguson et al 2005; Longini et al 2005) probably had such influence. While all well qualified and perfectly rigorous in their own right, somehow their implications were extrapolated, framing policy in a particular way. Here was the outbreak narrative in its purest form, with an outbreak response lined up, all justified by science90.As an epidemiologist, I keep looking for that pump handle solution. You know, what is that thing which is causing, mostly women, who are mostly the ones who raise chickens, to become infected, and then go on to negative outcomes, to die? What about the slaughter process?  What about the habit of picking the sickest bird in the group for the pot? And not being able to seek medical advice. The control might not actually be with birds, but at the human-animal interface that says how can I safely handle an infected bird? That may be an area that has gone under-investigated. Maybe we need to hit exactly where the ministries of health and agriculture meet91.If the real risks exist “exactly where ministries of health and agriculture meet”, it may be that the response, focused as it is on separate narratives of human and animal health may miss the “pump handle”. And, surely, understanding the underlying drivers of disease change – and the socio-ecological dynamics of emergence – must be part of any international response. We assume that zoonotic disease ‘hot spots’ exist where natural reservoirs of disease from wild fauna are found close to usually rapidly growing urban conditions with intensive human-animal contact, usually in settings where regulation and human health/veterinary services are weak or non-existent. Southern China is an example – as is Indonesia, Vietnam and much of south and south-east Asia, as well as urbanising Africa. The risks may be further enhanced with certain practices – consuming bush meat, living with livestock, shopping in wet markets and so on – and certain conditions 89 See http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/90 The influence of models with some heroic assumptions embedded in them on disease policy debates is of course not new; see, for example, the UK foot-and-mouth policy debate in 2001 (Campbell and Lee 2003; Kitching 2004).But – and no-one denies this – it is not so simple. Complex disease dynamics mean that we don’t know what is going to happen when, and when outbreaks do occur, their pattern and impact is highly context specific. Such complexity is not amenable to simple outbreak models, and requires a deeper understanding of changing ecologies, demographies and socio-economic contexts – and, in particular, their interactions and dynamics in particular places. This field level understanding of dynamic contexts is startlingly absent in much of the work on avian influenza. Yet quite a lot seems to be known, even if it appears rather anecdotally in research papers and conversations. The vivid descriptions of the ‘viral soup’ in Qinghai Lake in western China, the migratory birds that carry the virus, and the increase in human-livestock interactions in rapidly growing urban centres, are startling. As one ecologist put it: “There is a whirlpool of genes re-assorting…It’s a dream for reshuffling of viruses. The lake is a soup of viruses”. But beyond some surveys, reproduced as multi-coloured GIS maps (a favourite form of presentation in this field – with red always being danger) (Pfeiffer et al 2007a, b; Jones et al 2008), and some recent work on duck-rice systems (Gilbert et al 2008), there has been remarkably little detailed socio-ecological investigation of the dynamics of change.Given the potential threat and the resources being invested elsewhere in other activities, this seems remarkable. It of course relates to the politics of the policy process, and the individuals, organisations and professional interests that have captured the agenda. One informant commented: 91 Interview, Washington DC, 13 June 2008.3938An outbreak narrative is an appropriate framing for those who do not live in these places and who want, for perfectly legitimate reasons, to protect themselves from any disease. But it is perhaps less so when seen from another perspective. In many settings in the developing world, people are used to living with infectious disease. They have deeply embedded ‘cultural logics’ (cf. Hewlett and Hewlett 2007) that influence the way they understand and respond to diseases – of both animals and humans, and thus their constructions of risk. These may be at odds with standard medical and veterinary framings, resulting in disconnects between official programmes and local response. We found no sociologist, anthropologist or political scientist, for example, working on the avian influenza programmes of the major agencies. Yet there was a recognition that such perspectives were important in some quarters. In reflecting on the partial success of communications efforts, one informant commented:This is where the anthropological, the cultural and the social come in. This means long term engagement rather than just communicating about the risk. These are the more complex and nuanced issues. Such a perspective, focused on the dynamics of disease and local responses, casts the agenda wider than the standard outbreak-treatment-eradication mode. Whole ecosystems and their complex interactions must be examined, and the social-cultural-livelihood interactions must be at the centre of both diagnosis and response. Given the way the current response has been framed, structured and financed, this may prove difficult. But such a perspective may have important ramifications for a One World, One Health perspective – in terms of disciplinary and professional skills, organisational arrangements, and identifying the focus for funding. This is discussed further below.POVERTY, LIVELIHOODS AND EQUITYA related narrative emphasises the distributional impact of disease burdens, rather than the disease per se. It points in particular to the impacts of diseases on different people, and also the impact of interventions. For, as we have already noted, avian influenza mostly affects poultry keepers in the developing world, many of whom are poor. The responses geared at a ‘global public good response’ – which are often designed to protect richer countries – have a disproportionate negative effect on poor livestock keepers. This inequality is at the heart of some of the major tensions over the international response. For those framing the problem as an emergency – and focusing on pandemic threat to humans – mass culling of chickens is seen as a necessary evil, which if compensated for, offers a substantial public good benefit. But looked at from the perspective of those whose livelihoods at least in part depend on these poultry, such an intervention can be catastrophic. Clearly the impacts will depend on where it happens and the alternative sources of income which might be available. Banning backyard birds in Thailand, say, has less of an impact, and causes less of an uproar than it does in Vietnam or Cambodia where economic and livelihood contexts are different.There has been a range of excellent studies on the potential poverty impacts of avian influenza (both the disease and its control) by researchers linked to the FAO (Rushton et al 2005; Epprecht et al 2007; Roland-Holst et al 2008), as well as sustained commitment by the European Commission, the UK Department for International Development, among others to work in this area94. Studies document the distribution of poultry, the structure of the industry, the importance of poultry to livelihoods and the impacts of culling, market bans and so on. Findings all point to the importance of considering distributional impacts and equity in any assessment. This argument is picked up most forcefully by NGO campaign group, GRAIN, which makes the case that a ‘restructuring’ of the industry towards biosecure, large-scale units favours the large scale corporate interests which increasingly dominate the poultry industry globally. This has knock-on consequences for people’s livelihoods, food safety and animal welfare. This political economy of the food and farming industry, where politics and corporate interests define the shape of policy, is an area which, again, is obscured by the technical disease focus of the medicalised outbreak narratives. As Farmer (1996, 2001 and with Sen 2003) points out, structural inequalities define health policy and intervention and, as others point out, have done since the colonial era, when medical intervention and colonial conquest were very much part of the same project (cf. McLeod and Lewis 1988; Vaughan 1991; Arnold 1993; Anderson, 1996). An attention to the wider political economy of the international response to disease is therefore critical, and one that brings up sharp dilemmas and uncomfortable truths for narrower technical framings.With avian influenza there is a slow realisation that it is no longer an emergency. It is a deep rooted issue underlying the disease. But this is very slow; and is resisted. It is more attractive to be doing something in emergency mode rather than investing in strategic thinking…Avian influenza to my mind is more a symptom of massive changes in the poultry sector globally. …there have been massive increases in poultry and duck production. An avian influenza was bound to arise. The question is how to improve the management of these sectors. Not just about the disease. Overall, we should be aiming for a framework for other viruses. If this one is not it, some other will be. But we are not there yet. Far from it.92– notably poverty, malnutrition and immune system suppression (such as through HIV infection). In other words, these so-called ‘hot spots’ are not isolated places far from anywhere as the term might imply, but most of the developing world, and encompassing where most of humanity lives. As one informant explained:92 Interview, UK, 11 March 2008.93 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.94 See, for example: http://ec.europa.eu/world/avian_influenza/index.htm  and http://www.hpai-research.net/index.html4140Again, the debate about poverty and equity – and the wider political economy questions associated – highlights the division between those with essentially a disease-focused framing of the problem and solution, and those who adopt a broader, normative development perspective. With a normative position central, we must ask: whose world, whose health, and which public, which good? It is not ‘just’ about controlling a disease, but asking where, for whom and with what distributional consequences. Gender dimensions, for example, are central, and important work supported by the European Commission highlights this (Velasco et al 2008)95. There are many within the actor-networks at the core of the international response who of course see these questions as central, and particularly country-level projects and programmes are focused on just these developmental challenges. But sometimes this has been lost in the technical disease-focused response of the trio of global outbreak narratives. Given the mandates of the FAO – development through agriculture – or the WHO – improving human health – this is surprising, but witness to the strength and influence of certain framing assumptions and associated interests linked to the mainstream perspectives. However, as discussed further in section 11, if the One World, One Health banner is not just to be a glib slogan, representing an empty commitment to globalism devoid of politics, then these normative, political issues will have to be brought back in, requiring in turn, we suggest, a recasting of the outbreak narrative in some quite fundamental ways.ACCESS AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCEOne of the assumptions of the three international response narratives described earlier (veterinary, public health and pandemic preparedness) is that everyone plays ball; that there is a global consensus on what to do and that this can then be implemented through an international architecture, based on the principles of cooperation and respect. This is essential to allow early detection, rapid response, viral change monitoring, timely manufacturing of vaccines and so on. A well-oiled, rules-based international machinery, with the UN technical agencies at the centre, is needed, it was argued by some of our informants. As a number commented, the overall level of collaboration and integration surrounding the avian influenza response has been remarkable when contrasted with dismal past experiences of cross-UN and development agency working. For some, the avian influenza experience offers a shining example of the potential of effective global governance, and the effectiveness of the International Health Regulations (Fidler 2005a; Fidler and Gostin 2006; Lee and Fidler 2007). But it only requires one spanner in the works and things get difficult for this idealised system. In this case the spanner came from Indonesia, at the very epicentre of the outbreak, and a strident minister of health, Siti Fadilah Supari. Her book, ‘It’s Time For The World To Change in the Spirit of Dignity, Equity and Transparency – Divine Hand Behind Avian Influenza’, together with a campaign facilitated by the Malaysia-based campaign NGO, Third World Network, outlined the argument that sovereign rights should not automatically be ceded to the international system, and the WHO in particular96. Viruses from Indonesia should belong to Indonesia (even if they originally came from China), and that any benefits derived from using these – for manufacturing vaccines or drugs in particular – should result in benefit-sharing to the country of origin. The model was the recently negotiated International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources, which was seen as a major victory by campaign NGOs and southern governments whose arguments about corporate bio-piracy had animated the debate97. In the context of the avian influenza response, a focus on access rights, national sovereignty and benefit-sharing rather took the WHO by surprise. Surely, the Indonesian government would want WHO reference labs to sequence the viral samples? Surely sharing of the virus and associated information would be to everyone’s benefit, even if a private company came up with a vaccine? Surely this is very different from seeds and crops? It soon became clear that this rather naïve response was inadequate. From beyond its walls the WHO was not necessarily seen as the benevolent protector of humanity’s health. Some saw the WHO as part of the problem – too under the control of northern commercial and political interests; in the pocket of big pharma and the US. Conspiracy theory or not, such a view can easily take hold. There has perhaps been a lack of recognition in the WHO and other parts of the UN system of changes in economic world order and the geopolitical consequences. Indonesia sees itself as an emerging regional power – a moderate muslim country which needs to be taken seriously. Rumour has it that Venezuela, Cuba and Iran were ‘whispering in Indonesia’s ear’ and encouraging its stance98, as it has been advocating the independent manufacture of generic anti-viral drugs and confronting the patents issues (Fidler 2005b). India argued that it could deal with its own avian influenza outbreak, and did not need external experts providing advice when their own capacity was sufficient99. And, since SARS, China’s role in the whole international response has also been a focus of debate, with reporting and engagement with the international system being less than consistent.   With the refusal by the Indonesian government to supply human influenza virus samples or data to the international system in early 2007, the assumptions of the international governance system were put firmly to the test. High level meetings, diplomatic negotiations, behind-the-scenes deals and much media speculation characterised months of tense relations, culminating in a meeting held in March 2007 at which a deal was more-or-less brokered100. Wider discussions around 95 See: http://ec.europa.eu/world/avian_influenza/docs/gender_study_0608_en.pdf96 http://www.twnside.org.sg/announcement/Joint.NGO.Statement.on.Influenza.Virus.Sharing.htm97 http://www.fao.org/ag/CGRFA/itpgr.htm98 http://www.scottmcpherson.net/journal/2007/8/1/singapore-meeting-might-return-us-to-those-thrilling-days-of.html99 http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/WHO-Commends-Indias-Bird-Flu-Response-8125-1/100 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr09/en/index.html; see also Nature (2006a);(2006b)4342the access to research data, and the establishment of the OFFLU network (the joint OIE-FAO network of expertise on avian influenza) by Dr Ilaria Capua101 have sent strong signals about the importance of transparency. Commitments are now in place for transparent sharing of data and virus samples, and an initial global influenza virus tracking system has been launched by the WHO102. But the test will be in the practice, particularly if a pandemic emerges.The lessons from this episode are less about the mechanics of virus and information sharing than the political consequences, and the implications this has for visions of global governance. The WHO’s position at the centre of the network has to be earned, and respect and recognition of new important economic and political players must be part of this. As one informant observed:The virus sharing controversy was a shock. WHO is old style, not transparent. People are not impressed by symbols any more. Even the Red Cross. They are not impressed by doctors and big organisations. This is a good thing, but problems arise103.Another observed:That is a very delicate one… the issue of IHR and sharing of information is really, really critical…when we are talking about a world that is so interconnected I think it’s difficult to use the word sovereignty in areas where there is a potential for spread beyond boundaries104.Another reflected:It [the virus sharing issue] has been very awkward. WHO has been seen to be at fault, as far as member states are concerned. So it is difficult for WHO to intervene. It is an unusual situation…Yes, the system did need overhauling. For 50 years people did not realise that viruses got shared, and handed on to pharma companies…But the issue was not brought forward in a way that the multilateral system is able to deal with105.The broader reconfiguration of the geo-politics of health policy has ramifications across the policy process. A focus on access and rights – particularly for those who had not normally been at the table, notably big pharma and northern governments – suggest another important reframing of the debate making the simple formulations of ‘global governance’, and the associated slogan of ‘One World, One Health’, more difficult to realise than perhaps was first envisaged.101 http://www.offlu.net/organisation.php102 http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/aivirus_tracking_system/en/index.html; although the effectiveness of the deal was being questioned, see: http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/August/20070813131101lcnirellep0.6877405.html103 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.104 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.105 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.All of these alternative narratives are being actively debated within the organisations at the core of the international response actor network. But they are to date having limited purchase on the mainstream outbreak narratives. However, as the international avian influenza response continues to unfold, the consensus is always open to disturbance, as the virus sharing controversy dramatically showed. At the end of this paper we will return to the suggestive implications of these alternative narratives, and explore what they imply for a programmatic definition of the One World, One Health agenda in terms that move beyond simplistic globalism and the outbreak narrative. 8. ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS The avian influenza response involves a huge array of institutions, initiatives, programmes and projects. Acronyms fly in a bewildering mix. AHIF, AHITF, CFIA, CIDRAP, CMC-AH, DFID, EC, ECDC, ECTAD, EMPRES, EPR, FAO, GAINS,GF-TADS, GIS-AID, GLEWS,GOARN, GPAI, IPAPI, JICA, , OIE, OFFLU, PAHO, PHRD, PIC, SFERA, UNICEF, UNSIC, USAID, USDA, USCDC, WFP, WHO, WIC and many, many others are all involved in the international response – and many have been created by the new in-flows of funds106. There is much political positioning, turf warfaring and squabbles over mandates and funds, as we have seen. But this is normal practice, largely to be expected when something big and new arrives on the horizon, especially when attached to large amounts of money. The key question must be: is this evolving institutional and organisational architecture the most effective and efficient – and does it improve resilience, and the ability of the world to respond to new, uncertain, surprise-laden events? This is a more open question. 106 AHIF Avian and Human Influenza Facility; AHITF Avian and Human Influenza Task Force; CFIA Central Fund for Influenza Action; CIDRAP Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy, University of Minnesota; CMC-AH Crisis Management Centre for Animal Health; ECDC European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; ECTAD Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases; EMPRES Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases; EPR Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response; GAINS Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance; GF-TADS Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases; GIS-AID Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data; GLEWS Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases, including Zoonoses; GOARN Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network; GPAI Global Program for Avian and Human Influenza Control and Preparedness; IPAPI International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza; OFFLU OIE/FAO Network of Expertise on Avian Influenza; PAHO Pan American Health Organization; PHRD Policy and Human Resources Development (World Bank-managed Japanese Trust Fund); PIC Pandemic Influenza Contingency; PVS OIE Performance, Vision and Strategy; SFERA Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities; UNSIC United Nations System Influenza Coordination; USCDC United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; WIC World Influenza Centre.4544We quickly reach the limit of our system. We need expertise in the corridor to recognise what is going on. Surveillance is very different between countries: Indonesia and Nigeria for example. For the latter, there were no reports in September. In Indonesia they are looking and finding it. But again we are tracing events, not the situation in the country. Reporting in X is very poor. If they report, it’s because everyone already knows. The key question, when it gets serious, is the high level of expertise we need in the corridor. It is more and more difficult to find good people107.Thus judgement and local expertise remain key, and this is where the system sometimes falls down. Reluctance by veterinary services to report outbreaks, or farmers in fear of the consequences; the lack of field staff in-country and poor understanding of underlying epidemiological dynamics, all add to an air of uncertainty despite the fine coloured maps and interactive websites. Several people noted that most of some islands of Indonesia are covered in red dots (outbreaks) because there is an intensive, and very expensive, disease search presence there funded by the US. But as one informant put it: “This doesn’t mean that those bits of Indonesia that are blank, or other parts of the region that are not plastered with red dots, do not have the disease – just look at the map, it doesn’t make sense”108. This realistic and honest assessment points to the basic problem of surveillance – if there is poor trust in veterinary services, or if field-level capacity is weak, then reporting is going to be patchy. The maps in many cases report, not the overall pattern of outbreak, but the intensity and capacity of surveillance efforts.In order to gain some insights into this, we start with a closer look at the surveillance, information, prediction and early warning infrastructure which has been built – or in most cases extended – across the core organisations. Accurate surveillance, timely information, useful prediction and clear early warning are critical for any response – for avian influenza or any other epidemic. Time and accuracy is everything. Consequently this has been a focus of much investment in this area. Staff numbers associated with the ECTAD (Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases) group at FAO for example have expanded from less than ten to around 200 in just a few years as a direct result of avian influenza investments. This group collates information from a range of sources and assesses the spread of animal diseases around the world. Linked to the OIE reporting system, where CVOs must report to Paris any notifiable animal disease, and the public health surveillance system coordinated by WHO, the ECTAD group make regular updates and assessments to help focus the international animal health response. However, those working there are realistic about what such a system can and cannot do. 107 Interview, Rome, 1 February 2008.108 Interview, Rome, 1 February 2008.On the human health side, things are a bit more straightforward. Hospital reporting tends to be reasonably accurate, and diagnosis is straightforward if samples are sent to a lab. But of course not every case presents at a hospital, and not all hospitals and clinics will send samples, although the severity of HPAI in human The internal risk assessments are heavily based on expert opinion. We don’t have the data to say these are valid variables. Our experience is what matters. We look at anecdotal things – the likelihood of reporting and so on; stories about the hiding of information – people who went to the doctor but did not say they had poultry. There is more risk where people are hiding. It cannot be quantified though. The long term goal is to validate the variables, ideally with FAO. But now it is expert opinion and many uncertainties…For example, in some places there is lots of viral circulation, but little exposure because of well constructed wet markets. But in other places it is the opposite. We can say – if you want to lower risk you can do this or that. Yes, we would love to do it on a local basis, but the data is simply not there. We realise that things are different in different parts of a country. Look at China! How can you look at Tibet and Guangdong in the same assessment?113109 http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/62/6/555110 http://www.who.int/zoonoses/outbreaks/glews/en/index.html111 http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/media/nr-rp/2004/2004_gphin-rmispbk-eng.php; http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1000; http://www.gideononline.com/112 http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/113 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.114 This was the case with a rift valley fever outbreak in Sudan for example in November 2007, see: http://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_11_05/en/index.htmlcases and the level of at least reported mortalities is very high109. The WHO system involves data collection from a wide range of sources, including official reporting. The GLEWS network (the Global Early Warning System for Major Animal Diseases, including Zoonoses, a WHO-FAO-OIE partnership)110 includes scans of media reports and websites for early indications. They make use of the Canadian Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), which includes media and internet searches across several languages, and the ProMed reporting system, along with the Global Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Online Network (GIDEON) database111. In addition, there are ‘outbreak hotlines’ which people can contact – an email address (with a blackberry which is reputedly responded to around the clock) and a phone number. There are also inputs from informal reports by WHO field officers, members of the GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network)112 teams and others who are contacted when suspicions are aroused (Heymann and Rodier 1998, 2001, 2004). Information is one thing, but verification is another. Formally this has to be through notification by national governments’ health ministries – or designated WHO contact people – confirmed by lab tests, initially locally, and then in WHO reference labs. But such verifications can be slow in coming, and WHO personnel, particularly specialists in the influenza must make their own assessments. As one informant put it: Thus, as with some other zoonotic diseases, early information often comes from human reporting, rather than assessments of the animal health situation114. This is worrying, as catching things early and spotting and eradicating major avian outbreaks quickly is seen as central to the wider public health response. In practice, we have a situation in a number of countries where the avian disease is entrenched and occasional human outbreaks are treated – although in a large number of cases 4746the patient dies. Monitoring this situation, however, for signs of any pandemic pattern remains key, and so investment in surveillance systems is a top priority – across human and animal settings.A central challenge for zoonotic diseases is thus to coordinate surveillance across animal and human populations. As discussed, disparities in information quality and accuracy make this difficult, but across the international system there is a working attempt. This involves daily morning tele/videoconferences between the WHO and FAO emergency centres (the SHOC room in Geneva and the CMC in Rome), with interactions intensified with OIE and others when new outbreaks are defined. There is clearly an effective, collegial interaction across the agencies, helped by a few key individuals who have experience across the human and animal health areas. By all accounts this works well – and in many people’s eyes this represents unprecedented coordination and integration, helped along by funds to be sure, but also by a committed set of professional individuals. But the surveillance case presents some important organisational dilemmas. First, there is the question of coordination from local settings to global information systems. This is often not effective, especially where capacities are weak and suspicions are rife at the local level. As one informant put it: “What has been done does not follow a clear plan. There are overlapping mandates, rivalries, lack of clarity, unsustainability. There has been fudging of solutions”115.This relates to wider politics of information, and fears that supplying potentially sensitive information will have negative consequences. This applies to farmers clearly, but potentially also to national authorities who fear heavy-handed intervention in their affairs from outside, legitimised by human health issues and the IHR of 2005. As Calain (2007a, b) cogently points out, at the heart of surveillance activities there is often a clash of mandates and expectations, with international agencies potentially at loggerheads with national authorities. With global public health and wider security agendas deeply intertwined, the politics of surveillance is highly contentious. Such wider political tensions are compounded by more basic administrative and capacity issues at local level, with front-line health professionals resisting new surveillance efforts as they see redundancy and overlap in activities and competition for time, attention and budgets. As Calain (2007b:19) concludes, there is little doubt that the profusion of surveillance efforts “is essentially geared to benefit wealthy nations”, making suspicion, reticence and low levels of commitment understandable.Second, there are professional, disciplinary and organisational divides that affect the cultures and practices of day-to-day activity. Vets and medics do not always have the same perspectives, as we were told repeatedly in our interviews. As someone put it “there is that distinction I think that somehow treating the animal is less…yes, less noble, than treating people. So you just wait for the people to get infected!”116.The thinking between vets and medics is really, really separate. It’s challenging. That is a big one to overcome. It assumes there is no crossing over. The minds are still that way, even if they are working on something like avian influenza. We have to overcome these challenges. Everything is a problem. Human doctors think it’s a human disease. But they have to be reminded it is an animal disease! On the animal side, they forget the human element…There is this huge diversity of thinking. The lab bench people get along quite well. But getting others in the room…that’s hard. When people do get together, people tend to have very political discussions. We need better technical collaboration117.115 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.116 Interview, Washington DC, 13 June 2008.Another observed: Another commented:There is mistrust between the two castes – the doctors and the vets. It has prevented lots of collaboration. There is a slight complex of inferiority among the vets. And there is a big complex of superiority among the medics118.This affects the way interactions are conducted, and only when personal interactions take over do such difficulties die away. This is compounded by different interpretive styles, ways of assessing information and evidence and ways of framing responses. Yet, while difficult to pinpoint, medics and vets see outbreaks in different ways: a single case of a human may be enough to spark a reaction, yet thousands of chickens must die before anyone really notices. And in response terms vets have a wider range of actions at hand – birds can be culled, movements can be restricted and treatment enforced, whereas for humans draconian interventions are all a bit more difficult. Third, there is the tricky question of what information is made public, what is kept quiet and how things are presented. This was a subject of some discussion with informants in both WHO and FAO. While there are plenty of outbreak maps and alerts, these have to be understood with caution, as we have already discussed. Are these presenting an accurate picture of risk or do they represent, in fact, substantial ignorance and deep uncertainties? One informant recognised the responsibility of her position: “Yes, we come up with numbers. But I won’t let anyone see them. It’s very dangerous to release such numbers”. Thus, despite all the technical paraphernalia, and scientific protocols and procedures, there are after all human beings at the centre of information systems. They must make judgement calls: inevitably they black-box uncertainties, ignore some data, and emphasise others. This is based on expertise and experience, which is why they have the job. But this inevitably carries its own biases – personal, disciplinary, institutional. Here the ‘outbreak narrative’ and an emergency framing of the response often comes into play, and events (outbreaks, infection cases, mortalities) are emphasised over processes, and the less tangible, less easily recorded dynamics of slow spread or endemism. 117 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.118 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.4948Finally, there is the response to risk information and early warning alerts. Who believes it? Who wants to believe it? In studies of early warning systems in other fields (cf. Buchanan-Smith and Davies 1995), a ‘missing link’ between early warning information and response has often been found. As, if there is scepticism about the information, fear about the consequences and uncertainty about everything, it is not surprising that some calls are not heeded. This puts pressure on those handling information, constructing maps and presenting statistics to up the ante: fear and danger is always a good spur to action, it is thought. This may help, but it may also undermine – as people either panic or laugh at exaggerated statistics.  This look at the surveillance infrastructure highlights a number of important features of the disease response architecture today, as well as some important dilemmas. The emphasis on cross-border responses, and the international dimensions of epidemic responses are clearly significant. Disease and health is no longer just a national concern. The IHR make this very clear. Ceding sovereignty in the face of global threats is an important wider discourse in foreign affairs and international relations thinking today. Is there a global ‘responsibility to protect’ – to intervene where sovereign processes are failing, on behalf of ‘humanity’? Are rights universal, and therefore to be upheld universally through international jurisprudence and institutions? And does this all give excessive power and influence to international institutions, whose lines of accountability and forms of governance can be questioned?And how should such a global response be organised? Amongst the grand talk of international responsibility, universal rights and humanitarianism there are some more practical concerns. We have inherited a set of institutions designed for a different time and a different set of purposes. The modernist, humanitarian, developmental mission of the UN looks sometimes a bit outdated given the growth of new powers, the influence of transnational capital, philanthropic funding and the type of challenges and threats faced today. The UN’s accreted structures look creaky, inefficient and expensive to many, and often grossly ineffective. Simon Maxwell for example, argues that “the international system is clunky, unrepresentative and out of date”, that there is “system failure”119. In a similar vein, a UK government submission to the July 2008 House of Lords Select Committee report noted how “the current architecture is crowded and poorly coordinated. Within the diverse group of organisations there is no agreed vision or clarity over roles”120. Much of this relates to the cumbersome governance structures of the UN agencies. With national governments as members, and with political appointments, often without the relevant technical expertise, of permanent representatives through the organisations, it is not surprising that national or regional bloc interests sometimes 119 Developments Magazine http://www.developments.org.uk/articles/system-failure120 Diseases Know No Frontiers: How effective are Intergovernmental Organisations in controlling their spread? http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldintergov/143/143ii.pdf, Para 92, page 34.overshadow global, strategic goals. A long-term squeeze on core finances, certainly of FAO and WHO, means special-interest politics meets stark economics in the running of these organisations. With the coffers filled through project funds, often with an ‘emergency’ label, it is easy to see how strategic directions get diverted and organisational dysfunction emerges. Similar challenges are faced by the non-UN, inter-governmental organisation, the OIE. Here governments are represented through technical specialists, usually the Chief Veterinary Officer, so policy-making is dominated by the special interests and concerns of the veterinary profession, rather than political concerns. Clearly, none of these arrangements is ideal and, for the case of the avian influenza response, they have clearly presented some significant obstacles.These kind of complaints, and the resulting agenda for UN reform, have of course been around for decades, but there are many voices arguing for a new international institutional architecture today. In a major speech on foreign policy delivered in Boston in April 2008, UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, argued how a total rethink of the international architecture was necessary for today’s problems. Such views are echoed by many others, not least US Presidential candidate, Barack Obama121. The often tetchy relationship between the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions is at the centre of this, together with the relationships between these global institutions and the new conventions, protocols and regulations that have emerged to provide for ‘global governance’. Does the system need a total overhaul, almost a starting from scratch, or is the current international architecture broadly ‘fit for purpose’ but in need of a few teaks and revisions?The international response to avian influenza was perhaps a test case for this debate. Did the international system adapt effectively and perform well, or is it in need of some major reworking? Informants we talked with had diverse views – scattered along a spectrum. Several were very positive. One commented: Avian influenza has seen some of the most effective coordination between international agencies I have ever encountered… people will ask: what did it all achieve? There was no pandemic. But that surely is one big tick. We also can say that we looked at all sorts of things in new ways, and put money into veterinary systems, standards, disease surveillance, PHC [primary health care] services and so on. These are all good and useful things122.121 http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page15303.asp http://www.cgdev.org/doc/blog/obama_strengthen_security.pdf122 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.123 http://www.fao.org/pbe/pbee/en/219/index.htmlEveryone agreed that positive lessons had emerged. In the area of animal health, issues of confused mandates and overlapping responsibilities had been raised by a recent, highly critical, external evaluation123. This questioned why the OIE and the FAO Animal Production and Health Division seemed to be doing similar 5150things, and argued for a clearer separation with a recapturing of the development agenda by the FAO, leaving the standard animal health policy matters to the OIE. Some went further and argued for a merging of the two into a single organisation to improve coordination and effectiveness, avoiding the on-going turf wars and overlaps. This analysis was, not surprisingly, rejected by those within the OIE and FAO who pointed to their distinct mandates and effective coordination, especially around avian influenza. As one informant put it: “[despite the criticisms], all the FAO has to do right now is shout avian flu, and people will shower them with money!”124 And they had a point: once early squabbles subsided, the working relationship has been relatively smooth and improving, and substantial funds followed. Another informant suggested: “We are now just a normal dysfunctional family!”125 A more radical assessment voiced in a few quarters was that there is a need for a new organisation which focuses explicitly on zoonotic emerging infectious diseases, and brings together vets, medics and communication specialists under one roof, allowing surveillance systems, information and early warning, regulatory arrangements, capacity strengthening, scientific research and broader policy frameworks to become integrated and aligned in one set-up. This has a logical appeal. However, most of our informants (of course many with vested interests in some form of the status quo) rejected such a scenario. Many pointed to what they felt were the failings of UNAIDS126. One informant told us: “We did not want to make an institution like UNAIDS. We wanted to make something that could vaporize in a puff of smoke; that could create space for others.”127 The formula adopted for the avian influenza crisis did not go down ‘the UNAIDS route’, but involved a lighter-touch coordination group based in New York. The office of the UN System Influenza Coordination (UNSIC), within the UN Development Group, was established, as discussed earlier, at the direct request of the Secretary General, likely with lobbying from the then DG of WHO, Dr Lee Jong-wook. The assumption was that this would provide a coordination, profile-boosting and fund-raising function, which would have direct links to WHO in Geneva, which, it was assumed, would take on the main implementation activities, as this was framed at that point very much as a public health pandemic threat. This of course did not happen, and for good reason. The veterinarians, while slow to get going by many accounts and being ‘poor at politics’, were soon accepted as important players. And because of the Japanese funding deal, UNICEF was brought into the fold. Much to the resentment of many in the UN system, the World Bank was brought on board too (it had first formed a bank wide team in October 2005, and had a major seat at the first international conference in Geneva 124 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.125 Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.126 See the recent independent evaluation: http://www.unaids.org/en/AboutUNAIDS/IndependantEvaluation/default.asp127 Interview, London 27 February 2008.in November), with a special trust fund established to manage grants and loans. The World Bank, it was argued, brought different expertise and capacity to the table – offering both an overall economic development outlook and transparent and accountable funding mechanisms which were easy to manage and report on. One Bank insider commented:The Bank had something to offer, but it was intangible. Sometimes it was knowledge, sometimes it was just to bring a bit of order in a process where people had really strong technical views and needed a little help to put it together…The Bank is good at cross-sectoral, institutional issues, looking at things from an economic perspective and avian influenza touches so many different sectors… But the Bank can be portrayed as a non-technical agency strutting about telling everyone what to do. We’d say we are just articulating a framework that can be supported financially. But there’s a fine line between setting up the architecture and pushing everyone inside the building and telling them they have to live there128.David Nabarro, who was given the job as Senior UN System Coordinator in September 2005, proved a brilliant networker and facilitator. While different people have (very) different views about his role, all acknowledged his political acumen and energy129. UNSIC then became a focal point, envisaged by those inside as facilitating a ‘movement’ within and beyond the UN:128 Interview, Washington DC 12 June 2008.129 Examples of positive commentaries included: “David Nabarro was a great factor in raising the funds. He is very effective at loosening the purse strings. UNSIC is a real focus for the effort and policy. David’s tub thumping speeches helped raise the profile” (Interview, London, 25 January 2008); “The role played by UNSIC has been very significant. You have someone that can network and pull people together so easily, this is something that we need to better understand how we can use this model in the future for coordination. It is a coordination function and also an energising function, and one that ensures communalities are shared… there’s been the recognition that there are quantifiable merits with the model - cost is miniscule and the benefits are extremely significant, but it requires a mandate.” (Interview, New York, 9 June 2008). There were detractors too: “UNISC is now becoming irrelevant, that’s my personal view, but communications between agencies is now better, even if UNSIC is not co-ordinating it.” (Interview, New York, 9 June 2008). See also Cheng and Nabarro (2006) and the recent evaluation of UNSIC (Willitts-King, Smith and Sims, 2008).130 Interview, Geneva, 7 March 2008.The relentless efforts by David Nabarro have kept things moving. The Action Plan was an attempt at a coordinated approach: 12 agencies. It had never been done before. A great achievement, it created bridges. WHO is now being harassed by other organisations to allow them to get involved…All agencies now want to be involved – tourism, migration, civil aviation etc. Everyone wants to be involved in global health issues. This is good. It breaks down barriers. Even if UNSIC stops something will be left behind. A movement has been created130.This framing, which avoids models of a fixed, permanent organisation, is interesting and strategic. The focus was on facilitation, on ideas, on getting people talking to each other, on building bridges sometimes over huge gulfs – and raising money. 5352Normally I am sceptical, not excited about what we do. Here we are doing something important. Long term. This is a process that will mark a period of history…There is a need to be flexible, so that people can pull institutions with them. Not very much has been formalised… It is an interesting moment. We have been lucky: 15 - 20 committed individuals made the difference131.UNSIC did a very good job, bringing organisations closer together, defining tasks for the core organisations, getting the issue onto the political agenda in many countries. Now, three years further on, I am not so convinced of the added value of UNSIC, trying to get out of coordinating and into a leading role. This is not their job - they should be leading with agenda setting, defining priorities, with the World Bank132.The movement metaphor provided UNSIC with a vision and mission – in the system, yet outside; cooperating, yet challenging. There was genuine excitement and enthusiasm: this was the future.The sense of personal connection and commitment was apparent too. As someone closely involved reflected: “It wasn’t enough to say here is something for the global public good. We first had to build relationships”133. Others commented on the way a network was built:They got to know each other too. You get a community of involved people… Everybody, everybody is there. The main donors, the countries, US, Japan, the European Commission, the UK, Canada, Australia, in terms of the very active ones. And then the main organisations - OIE, WHO, FAO. They are all on first name terms now134.131 Interview, Brussels, 4 March 2008.132 Interview, London, 13 May 2008.133 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.134 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.Several years on, there are widely divergent views on the UNSIC experience. Some argue that this is a model for the future of the UN, and should be central to any UN reform strategy. It allows coordination across agencies – and, critically, beyond the UN – it allows funds to flow efficiently and be properly managed, and it allows the technical agencies to do what they do best. Others disagreed. They saw gradual ‘mission creep’ and interference in what should be technical mandates of technical agencies by those who did not know what they were talking about. They saw funds being managed by the World Bank trust funds and not them, and, they argued, a reduction in core funding to the technical agencies which became increasingly reliant on short-term loan based funding from World Bank managed sources. And they saw competition for power, prestige and authority. As agency mandates moved to the centre they became more politicised and controlled. Whether this was just sour grapes of insightful analysis is difficult to tell, but the debate has certainly influenced the policy process. UNSIC remains key, but its future – or the future of similar cross-cutting coordinating bodies – remains up for debate.The avian influenza response has therefore raised some fairly fundamental issues about organisational arrangements and institutional architecture at the global level. The coherence and coordination, though flawed, found at the global level, is not matched at the local or national level. This problem is particularly acute in more aid-dependent countries, where projects, programmes, strategies sometimes trip over each other. Apparently in 2005, Vietnam had almost 800 donor missions in one year135. One informant commented: “In Cambodia there are 22 donors active in the health sector. There are over 200 NGOs also and 109 projects.  You can imagine how useful it would be if everyone could work in a coordinated way”136.  In the context of UN reform debates, and discussions about organisational change more generally, these are familiar issues. The prospect of a one-stop-shop approach to country-level delivery by the UN may, in these circumstances, have many merits137, yet substantial challenges remain on the ground138. Much of the impetus for a coordinated response to avian influenza indeed came from demands at the country level. However despite the successes, some major challenges for the future are pointed to.First are strategies for managing overlap in mandate and function to ensure efficiency and coherence, resulting in ‘optimal redundancy’ for ‘high reliability’. In highly complex dynamic situations, where surprise and uncertainty is always present, designing neat organisations that can respond to all possible circumstances is impossible – and probably dangerous. It is necessary to accept a certain messiness, which inevitably involves a level of redundancy, to ensure that a ‘high reliability organisation’ (Perrow 1999; Weick and Sutcliffe 2001)139, with enhanced system resilience, can respond to the inherent uncertainty. In addition to some level of redundancy, important design features include: flexible organisational architecture, a commitment to experimentation, learning from failure, continuous reinvention as adaptive response, prioritising anticipation as well as resilience, and lines of authority which are clear and simple. In many respects, by default rather than design, core aspects of the current avian influenza response system do mirror some aspects of these features. What is needed is to enhance these further.Second, as already discussed, coordination across technical areas, agencies and functions has been a major issue. This is a critical feature of the response to any zoonosis, whether avian influenza or others. Here there is a huge array of organisations involved. As one respondent put it: “We are working with our 135 Comment by S. Tyson from DFID,in: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldintergov/143/143ii.pdf, para 150, page 52.136 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.137 See details on the ‘Delivery as One’ pilot projects at: http://www.undg.org/?P=7 and the High Level Panel report of November 2007: http://www.undg.org/archive_docs/9021-High_Level_Panel_Report.pdf and http://www.un.org/events/panel/138 The country-level studies which are currently being completed explore this issue from the standpoint of different country experiences, including that of Vietnam, a pilot ‘One UN’ country. See http://www.steps-centre.org/ourresearch/avianflu.html139 http://www.highreliability.org/index.html5554international partners, both NGOs and international agencies and that’s hard. ‘Herding cats’ is the phrase we are using”140. The role of UNSIC – and the IPAPI group – have been important, but there have been blockages and constraints to joint working, although many have been at least partially undone over time. One informant complained:There is collaboration and it is useful but you’d be surprised at the looks of horror when you say - wouldn’t it be a good idea if every time you had an animal case someone rang up the human health people so you could send out a team together and check the people too. At the big meetings…what inevitably happens is that WHO makes a little speech, FAO makes a little speech, David Nabarro makes a little speech, and OIE too, who maintain their vigilant independence from the UN system…This sends the wrong message. The whole effort, the whole ethos of this has been to coordinate, to integrate. Yet when we get to tell the world how well we work together, we do it individually! 141 Whether there needs to be more integrated organisational arrangements to bring things together is a much disputed point, but certainly more joint working and collegial interaction across divides is needed, as many informants agreed. For example, Jakob Zinsstag from the Swiss Tropical Institute argues for a more integrated system of local level para-veterinary and para-medical support for Africa142 and others have made the case for integrated training systems, such as joint veterinary and medical schools143. And, in the wider pandemic preparedness challenge, the set of players becomes even larger. One informant said:The focus has to be not only the human and animal health side, but also these other elements in terms of pandemic planning, some other elements of society.Now when you look at FAO, they are not going to sit there and say ‘my biggest concern is the continuation of the financial services sector’. It requires a bigger picture.144140 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.141 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.142 http://www.sti.ch/datensatzsammlung/newsletter/newslettermarch08/onehealthzinsstag.html143 This is an example of one the few cases of this sort of initiative: http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/news/vs/oct05/index.html#dvmmph144 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.Third, is the issue of mandate and responsibility. Currently mandates are largely technically defined, and present major technical, professional and disciplinary divides as we have discussed. These can be real obstacles to effective working, as they perpetuate some basic misunderstandings and prejudices; and such divides can be reinforced by personalities, fiefdoms and territories. The avian influenza response, just as any other internationally coordinated activity, has resulted in some major ‘big men’ problems, where personality clashes have soured relationships. Many of these divides have been over ownership and control of particular technical areas, and so funds and authority. Bringing the ‘two castes’ of vets and medics together in particular, but also, we would argue, social scientists of various sorts, must be a major challenge for the future, although challenging to achieve given institutional and professional histories. This may require some basic re-thinking about training (joint vet/medic schools or courses), re-skilling (social scientists with understandings of epidemiology and technical scientists with social science skills), and professional incentives (for joint working, publishing across sectors and disciplines and so on), and job descriptions/recruitment strategies (vets in WHO, and medics in FAO or OIE, for example, with social scientists in all organisations). One informant pointed to the biases in the professional advice systems as currently structured:One of the problems is that within veterinary advice systems, the core advisors are nearly all lab vets, not epidemiologists for example. These are the chief technical advisers in governments and agencies. The focus is on diagnosis and detection of the disease agent. This is seen as the most important thing. This is a limited view when the disease is in a population – and the population exists in a social context…The lack of epidemiological and economic skills is very frustrating. The specialists that exist know the exact changes of amino acids in the virus, but nothing much else. The bigger picture is lost145.Fourth, there have been some important lessons about funding: raising it, managing it and spending it. A joint approach, across agencies, to raising funds has clearly been a major success (or was for a while). Major pledging events, even if expensive, add profile, and attract senior figures. Over 1,000 people turned up for the Beijing pledging conference, including more than 50 ambassadors and ministers, from over 100 countries. This large and diverse attendance allowed funding agencies, and the bureaucrats involved, to pitch for funds from pots that might not otherwise exist. The high political profile of avian influenza, particularly following US President Bush’s September 2005 speech, meant that emergency funds, not just development funds, started to flow. Consequently the amounts far exceeded those that would be realisable under normal budget envelopes. Spending so much money efficiently and effectively – and on time, however, is not easy. The World Bank trust fund mechanism proved a useful approach, although some argue that this diverted funds away from core activities in the technical agencies. One well justified complaint, however has been that funds have tended to end up with the core agencies and not with national governments. In a reflection on progress so far, the technical meeting held in Rome in June 2007 concluded candidly that:Contrary to the stated intent in Beijing to ensure that the majority of funding was made available directly to countries in support of their national avian and human influenza programmes, analysis of recipients of funds indicates that less than half of total funding is going to countries; so far non-national recipients such as regional organisations and the United Nations are the main recipients of the funds that have been disbursed146.145 Interview, UK, 11 March 2008.146 Food and Agriculture Organisation (2007c) http://www.fao.org/docs//eims/upload//232772/ah668e.pdf (para 5.1b, page 29).5756This highlights the problem of disbursement. While coordination may have been at least partially effective at the international level, it has rarely been so at country level. This has made project funding in the field difficult, and integration even more so. As mentioned before the type of funds also made a big difference. Many of the funds were earmarked ‘emergency’ funds on short time frames, requiring a rapid spend; others were loans through the World Bank system, and so carrying with them the potential for debt; and many were ‘soft’ project funds, providing plenty of cash, but only over short periods and without the overhead to invest in core support. The result has been a projectisation of activity which has resulted in some unfortunate overlaps, high transactions costs and an expansion of staff on short-term, consultant-style contracts, without longer term institutional commitments. Finally, there is the question of monitoring and learning approaches and systems of accountability. UNSIC has provided an invaluable function of collating data and providing updates on activities and expenditures. The December 2007 report is in many senses exemplary, cutting, as it does, across so many fields and activities and involving so many people and resources147. To get a bird’s eye view (so to speak) of the avian influenza response the report is clearly the first port of call. For donors and others this reporting provides an important level of accountability. But how much has this been just a data collation exercise, based on often unverified data sources, and not one that enhances more fundamental reflection and learning on the basis of experience? These systems seem to be less in place. The real-time evaluation of the FAO went through several iterations before a useful document emerged. Some of its key findings were then rejected by the management (notably the recommendation to appoint a dedicated operations manager)148. While allowing a detailed, forensic look at performance and practice in real time, the evaluation did not seem to generate much reflection and learning – more animosity and defensiveness. Indeed, donor influence had a lot to do with this. As one participant in the evaluation explained:The US said: ‘we are only interested in containment’. This was the US rep with a prepared statement. ‘Get the big cannons out! Throw everything at it!’ That Iraq thing again. And they are by far the biggest donor…The US context is that avian influenza is a bio threat! Keep it out of the US! It’s secondary that people are dying elsewhere. But FAO is obliged to deal with the wider picture. Livelihoods. Trade. FAO is a development organisation obliged to deal with these things149.In the end it is difficult to know what is being monitored against what and for whom. Most activities to date have been aimed at assuring donors that money has been spent well. But measures of impact and effectiveness – and focal points around which learning needs to be emphasised – have not been identified; and if they 147 http://www.undg.org/docs/8097/12-18-07-UN-WB-AHI-Progress-Report-final.doc and148 http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=52 149 http://www.fao.org/pbe/pbee/en/index.html (see both main report and management response)  Interview, Rome, 30 January 2008.have been they tend to be sectorally bound, relating to a particular framing of response. A bigger questioning of effectiveness, efficiency and boosting resilience – and particularly the distributional effects (who wins, who loses) have not been investigated. This breeds a complacency that might have spilled over into some of the ‘forward look’ discussions around the ‘One World, One Health’ agenda. We would argue that a more searching reflection on ‘framing assumptions’ (or in monitoring and evaluation language, ‘theories of change’) is needed, and one that brings in other voices and perspectives to create a wider basis for accountability, beyond that required by donors. We will pick up on this theme in the conclusion.In the end of course, it is difficult to assess whether the organisational architecture that has evolved for the avian influenza response, incrementally, often chaotically and with many flaws, has worked well or not. We have not had a pandemic: that may be an indicator of success, or not. Yet, the virus has spread over a large part of the world, and has become endemic in a number of countries where continuous outbreaks occur. More than two billion chickens have been slaughtered as a result of the interventions galvanised by the international response, with major impacts on businesses, markets and livelihoods. A number of new systems have been put in place – surveillance, information management, early warning, public communication; and human health and veterinary services have been strengthened in some places. Are we therefore better prepared, more resilient than before? No-one knows.A fear of the unknown of course feeds into a set of concerns about ‘security’ which are at the heart of the debate about avian influenza. These security discourses, however, require some unpacking in order to understand their impact on the politics of the policy process. This is the aim of the next section.9. SECURITY DISCOURSESAs we have seen, the wider political forces – particularly in the US, but also in the EU, Australia and Japan – push for a set of responses that emphasise the protection of healthy rich northern populations: the virus must be kept out. Yet it is realised that a simple fortress approach may not work. John Barry points out that the 1918 pandemic probably originated in an army base in Kansas. As a senior WHO official put it: 150 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.With dense populations, large amounts of virus increases the likelihood of a pandemic. But a pandemic could start in a developed country. The Americans assume it will happen elsewhere and the job is to keep it out. But it could start there. When can we say we are prepared? Never is the answer150.5958So, no-one is safe, anywhere. It requires a global response to an unknown threat in order to keep ‘the homeland’ safe. And it requires a concerted effort that goes beyond the vets and medics, and narrow professional concerns, to an emphasis on global systems that protect people and economies from huge mortalities and dramatic collapse. This is central to the pandemic preparedness narrative discussed in section 6; but it is important to go further and identify the idea of ‘security’ as central. After 9/11, it is not surprising that such discourse has emerged around the potential for a pandemic. The threat of pandemic influenza is apparently graded higher than terrorist attack in the US in terms of national security (Barry 2004). Keeping the virus out of America, and dealing with it at source has been seen as a major priority by the US administration. The US state department, for example, makes the rationale for such investment absolutely clear151. Broader international efforts are of course linked, and the establishment of IPAPI (International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza) offered an informal inter-governmental approach to pushing agendas and coordinating funding, outside the UN system.Much of this debate in the US presents a particular version of national security, linked to political, public and electoral concerns in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, not about disease control per se and certainly not about issues of poverty, equity and development. With health and foreign policy so intertwined152, and avian influenza concerns being seen as part of ‘homeland security’, the imperative to protect national interests often trumps global concerns in the US. The US has been important. It has been taken very seriously here.  It’s all linked with post 9/11 contingency planning, and Hurricane Katrina. There was a realisation that the country really needed to get itself organised for this sort of event153.151 See the January 2006 report to Congress, http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/59025.pdf as well as the main Department of State site, http://www.state.gov/g/avianflu/. Also see: http://www.pandemicflu.gov, http://www.state.gov/g/avianflu, http://www.usda.gov/birdflu, http://www.hhs.gov, http://www.cdc.gov and http://www.usaid.gov.152 See discussions in: Fidler 1999, 2003, 2004; Katz and Singer 2002; Ingram 2005; Owen and Roberts 2006; Kickbusch et al 2007.153 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.154 http://www.foresight.gov.uk/OurWork/CompletedProjects/Infectious/Index.asp; executive summary: http://www.foresight.gov.uk/Infectious%20Diseases/E1_ID_Executive_Summary.pdfIn the UK, the Foresight report ‘Infectious Diseases: Preparing for the Future’154 spun a vivid ‘Out of Africa’ narrative about the threats of emerging diseases from the developing world. Interventions that then followed aimed to check this flow, and reduce this threat. Health planning around avian influenza in Europe and North America is very much seen in this vein, with Departments of Health working with civil contingency units and homeland security branches, in, for example, the US State Department or the UK’s Cabinet Office155. Risk registers, covering all perceived risks to health and security are compiled and reviewed at the highest level. Discourses of security have of course intersected with concerns about health and disease for a long time. Close associations between disease control and colonial conquest have been widely discussed (cf. King 2002), as have investments by the military in research on infectious diseases, particularly relating to the tropics where troops might serve, or where source material for bioterrorism could emerge (Khardori 2006). This organisational and institutional architecture goes beyond the core public agencies discussed in the previous section. Thus, US investments in the high security foreign animal disease lab at Plum Island have largely been driven by homeland security concerns156. Major conferences on bioterrorism, and no doubt extensive, but classified, policy discussions have occurred in the past years, with avian influenza being a focus for attention157. With defence and homeland security spending less constrained than that for veterinary or public health, these concerns have had significant effects both on the framing of the debate and the funding of responses. But there is not one single framing of security. Historically, different versions have been evident (Hinchliffe 2007: 105, citing Collier and Lackoff 2006). From the seventeenth century in Europe, a national security paradigm became dominant, co-constructed with the emergence of monarchical states. Such states had sovereign territory, with borders defended by military force. Such a national, state-based military security discourse has persisted, and is the basis of much thinking about state-making and international relations to the present. In the late nineteenth century, another version of security was added. This focused on the security of populations, and in particular their health. This saw the rise of public health interventions, based on new epidemiological knowledge about the spread of disease. Population security, first at the level of the nation, and later, with the advent of the WHO in 1948, at the global level, became an important strand of security discourse, often intersecting with the national-military security perspective in important ways. In more recent times, a third version has appeared, focusing on ‘vital systems security’. Here the focus is less on nations or populations but more on the systems and routines that keep economies and societies ticking; and We were told: 155 For the UK, see the UK Resilience site: http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/pandemicflu.aspx and the link to the Civil Contingencies Secretariat of the Cabinet Office; for the US, see: http://www.pandemicflu.gov/156 See the 2002 Wall Street Journal article at: http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/bioterrorismplumisland.html157 In the US, the 9/11 Commission Act required a national biosurveillance system to be set up to counter bioterrorist attack. See the July 2008 report of the US Government Accountability Office, http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08960t.pdf. CIDRAP has a long list of resources on bioterrorism, as well as frequent news updates and links to conferences and meetings on bioterror in which avian influenza is frequently cited, see: http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/bioprep/index.html. Also see the long list of sources on the US Environmental Protection Agency site on ‘agroterror’: http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/thom.html 6160The medical and defence establishments think in very similar ways. Doctors and nurses are the new army, and vaccines are the new weapons. This is a very different view of health security158.The population-based public health security discourse is clearly very evident too, and central to the WHO response – and indeed much of the argument for the veterinary response too. Classic epidemiological arguments define populations ‘at risk’, and health security aims to protect them – and protect them from affecting others. And finally, ‘vital systems’ security discourses are very prevalent, particularly in the pandemic planning narratives and the civil contingency responses that have developed. But, because of the pliability of the term, and its high political and policy status, ‘security’ language and thinking has permeated the debate. The meanings and implications of the use of the ‘S’ word, however, are not always clear, allowing it to be captured at one moment by a national-military tone, and at others by a more benevolent population and vital systems perspective. With security so central to the wider policy discourse, this slipperiness is both understandable, but also dangerous. A quick look through documentation on avian influenza sees security associated with a range of different terms – global, homeland, national, civil, population, system, health, bio, food, human, livelihood, personal and more. Again, we need to ask: whose security, against what, for what end? This is often not clear. Funding politics may, in the end, dominate, as a version focused on ‘homeland security’ or ‘bioterror’ trumps other interpretations. A wider debate about public health and foreign affairs is related – and, in particular, how another slippery term ‘global health governance’ is being defined (Fidler 2007 a, b).  But there are perspectives on security beyond those that currently dominate. preparedness for emergencies. This has been key for much of the security and civil contingency planning around terrorism, as well as so-called natural hazards – earthquakes, floods or diseases. A whole professional discipline of disaster planning and management, now given more urgency by global climate change, has emerged focusing on making ‘vital systems’ more resilient and allowing adaptation in the face of shocks or stresses.  The avian influenza response is interesting because the different outbreak narratives which dominate mainstream policy thinking cut across these different, historically-situated versions of what is meant by ‘security’. With the emphasis on ‘homeland security’ and bioterror, an old-fashioned national security agenda is central. This is extended by thinking that emphasises global security responses across borders, and the associated slogans such as ‘responsibility to protect’ (even though these measures are essentially to protect national territories and citizens of particular nation states). As one informant put it: 158 Interview, Geneva, 5 March 2008.These relate more closely to the alternative narratives on avian influenza, which have also been sidelined to date, but which may offer approaches to global health governance and security that are currently not on the table. So for example, the March 2007 Oslo Declaration of Foreign Ministers from Norway, Brazil, France, Indonesia, Senegal, South Africa and Thailand identified human security as an important framing for the global health debate159. A follow-up symposium identified a wider agenda for ‘health diplomacy’160. Here issues of equity, poverty and development come to the fore, echoing the ‘human development’ perspective of UNDP. A wider concern with ethics and civic concerns was also highlighted in the July 2006 Bellagio statement. This emphasised issues of social justice, and more bottom up, citizen led responses, focused on basic rights161.As with the disease and responses to it, there are different framings of governance – and notions of ‘security’. The international avian influenza response has adopted a variety of perspectives, often reflecting particular national political and policy interests. Thus the US response has been very much centred on ‘homeland security’ – protect ‘us’ from ‘them’ at source, going beyond national borders. The European perspective has similar elements, but given its largely continental context, with a steady flow of avian influenza virus into mainland Europe from the Balkans and beyond, there has to be a less worried tone. The actions of European member states has also shown a determined focus on effective control, along with the European Commission’s commitment to a wider developmental angle to the global response, building on the experience of responding to the tsunami162. There are other perspectives too – such as those who signed up to the Oslo Declaration – which frame governance and security more in terms of basic human needs and rights. And, as we saw in section 7, there is perhaps an emerging and assertive Asian perspective which argues that access, control and rights must be more widely shared, that having everything geared towards northern – and especially American – public anxieties, political concerns and capitalist interests is simply not equitable. The IHR 2005, discussed in section 5, defined a new form of multilateral response to international health issues, very much framed in terms of assuring global health security. A balance between sovereign states and individual country membership of international organisations like WHO and global responsibility must be found, it argues. This means that sometimes, for the greater global good, international action is required. But, as we saw, the IHR 2005, while allowing greater scope for action 159 http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/ud/about_mfa/Minister-of-Foreign-Affairs-Jonas-Gahr-S/Speeches-and-articles/2007/lancet.html?id=466469160 For the ‘Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative symposium, see: http://www.who.int/trade/symposium/en/index.html; see also Margaret Chan, DG of WHO on health diplomacy: http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2007/130207_norway/en/index.html161 http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/bioethics/bellagio/index.html. Other work, including the citizen engagement in pandemic influenza pilot project, as well as a range of reports on ethical issues from WHO, the Board on Global Health, the Institute of Medicine, the US Centers for Disease Control and others are included at: http://www.who.int/ethics/influenza_project/en/index1.html 162 Interviews, March, June 2008. http://ec.europa.eu/world/avian_influenza/index.htm6362in theory based on a new vision of transparent consensus-oriented globalism, has limits in practice. What will China announce, or not; which virus samples will be shared; and can big pharma be made to play ball? These are tricky questions at the heart of the challenge for global governance, and ones that have no easy answers. Currently there is an uneasy international consensus on global health security and its implementation, and a range of agreed legal instruments and institutions. Yet there are, within these diverse framings of ‘security’ which are largely dominated by the perspectives of the currently more powerful countries, attempts to recapture a more equitable, less hegemonic version, focused on human securities, ethics and rights. These again ask: Whose world? Whose health? And suggest a different shape to politics and the political economy. As the debate moves forward, and other players become more assertive, the cracks and fractures in the current consensus may become clearer, requiring deeper deliberation of what we really mean by global health governance and security.For, we argue, the big questions about what to do and where in any international response to an emerging disease, as highlighted so vividly by avian influenza, mean that different types of governance arrangements will be required, with different framings of security. It is this recurring feature of deep uncertainty and ignorance that we want to probe in the next section. Does ‘the emperor’ of the international response have any clothes – or evidence-based backing for the response – and how do understandings of risk and uncertainty get dealt with by experts and others in constructing the response?10. DOES THE EMPEROR HAVE ANY CLOTHES? RISK, UNCERTAINTY AND EXPERTISECentral to any understanding of an epidemic is expertise. But the nature of that expertise and the authority it carries has huge consequences for the way public policy is designed. Evidence-based policy is the contemporary mantra, but what evidence is used, and what is ignored in the development of public policy? And in what ways is such knowledge and evidence framed? These are important questions, derived from a constructivist stance to science and policy. This does not mean that we are arguing for a relativist perspective where anything goes, or some type of conspiracy theory where evidence has been hidden or results somehow fiddled. But we are arguing for a more critical look at the underlying basis of constructing arguments that influence policy – the context and practice of science and policy, the framing devices used, and the way data are presented and terms used. This is of course a major study in its own right and we can only touch the surface. However, as the previous sections have highlighted, there are huge uncertainties evident (where the likelihoods of possible outcomes are not clear), and not a little ignorance (where we don’t know what we don’t know). Some perspectives have not been prominent in the policy debate, while others have taken centre stage, linked with powerful people, organisations and money. Thus a study of knowledge in policy is also a study of power – and the construction of discourses and practices in particular contexts163.Such knowledge politics are played out in particular around major uncertainties and areas of ignorance. In the past sections, we have seen a variety of examples relating to causal mechanisms (viral change, reassortment and genetic dynamics), spread in animals (ducks, wild birds, trade), incidence (estimates of viral load, the cyclical, inter-annual and seasonal patterns, and the prevalence of ‘endemic’ settings), transmission (and the likelihood of human-human transmission), impact (on mortality rates of wild birds, domestic poultry and humans), and response (efficacy of bird culling, vaccination and so on in different settings). Such uncertainties – or areas of ignorance – are of course widely recognised in the scientific and policy advice community164. One informant summed it up thus:It is difficult to deal with potentially catastrophic risk, where you cannot establish the risks. It’s like having an insurance policy which cannot guarantee to pay out and there is no way of pricing the premium. This is not a traditional infectious disease problem. The normal approach of vaccine or treatment is difficult. We are talking of highly contingent risk, where it is very difficult to deal with the economics of response165.163 Following Foucault (1997), we can see the unfolding of the avian influenza response as a study in biopolitics and biopower, where actors and associated networks exercise power and control through processes of framing, and practices of categorisation, ordering and governmentality (cf. Rose 2006).164 Although often framed in terms of ‘risk’, cf. Dowdle (2006).165 Interview, London, 25 January 2008.166 Interview, Brussels, 3 March 2008.Another commented from a different perspective:Children dying in east Turkey – of course everyone gets scared… But no one can say H5 is more likely to cause a pandemic than H7. Both are quite dangerous. In one case handled well with media; the other was an explosion. The first challenge is this, we don’t know, we must be open. My personal line - I’ve studied virology - is not to emphasise that this virus will cause a pandemic, but we must be honest. We never know with this type of virus166.In scientific articles margins of error and coefficients of variation are of course quoted. Yet the framing of the core ‘outbreak narrative’ responses has been, as we have seen, around probabilistic risk – and an emphasis on prediction and control – and not a more central admission of uncertainty and ignorance. This we argue 6564is problematic, even dangerous. Look at virtually any policy statement or position paper on avian influenza and the well-used statistics on potential mortalities are trotted out. For effect these tend to be at the high end of the spectrum. Despite the qualifications and conditions attached, these statistics are the ones that get picked up in the media and in popular treatments – in the growing library of books, magazine articles and op-eds on the issue – as well as in ministers’ briefings and policy proclamations. This is natural and not surprising. There is no conspiracy involved – and indeed they may be right. Better to be cautious and plan for the worst than use uncertainty or ignorance to do nothing: “if you accept the premise that some things are beyond the reach of science, that doesn’t prevent us from taking actions”, argued one informant167. How do such framings arise? As we have seen, there have been intense political and bureaucratic pressures – with commitments from the President of the US downwards pushing the process. There has been a jockeying for position and funds in the policy debate that followed, with headline grabbing an important tactic. And there have been the workings of science advice itself within and between organisations involved in the avian influenza response. This is where, we suggest, the light needs to be shone more brightly. For in the processes on-going within the WHO, FAO, OIE, UNICEF, the World Bank and the rest, science and policy is inevitably mutually constructed. Science does not neatly feed into policy in an unproblematic and linear way, nor do politics and policy simply dominate science. There is a two-way traffic. But sometimes technical ‘truths’ are not fully questioned. One non-technical outsider commented:The major technical premises, on which the [global] strategy was developed, were never clearly articulated or well explained. That’s true for things like culling, vaccination, compensation…no one seems to ask stupid but hard questions, like why are we doing this in this way when before we were told that vaccination is no use? Or why are we culling in countries where the virus is endemic, because that hurts a whole load of small farmers and doesn’t stop the infection spreading? So why are we sticking to a system that doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense?.The lack of uniform technical advice has been a problem - especially in-country. The agencies can contradict each other. If there is a division on the technical advice it’s very difficult to design projects168.The outbreak narratives we have discussed fit neatly into both the scientific and policy cultures involved. The science, as we have seen, has been dominated by a particular type of medical and veterinary perspective, reinforced by emergency and humanitarian response approaches. This emphasises disease events in particular places, and the imperative to control and eradicate. Policy then responds in particular ways that are well suited to bureaucratic routines and funding protocols. Thus the political and organisational settings for science advice and policymaking act to exclude alternative framings, focusing instead on a particular set of outbreak narratives as the core response. This process of mutual construction – which, as we have emphasised before, is not necessarily ‘wrong’ – acts to black-box uncertainty and denies forms of ignorance, and other perspectives that are difficult, awkward and just don’t fit. The mainstream knowledge framing is thus around ‘risk’ – something that can be measured– and the response, risk management – through surveillance, early warning systems and treatment and control strategies, where known, measured risks are minimised. But this is only part of the story. What happens when we don’t know outcomes or likelihoods? What happens when there are alternative framings of impacts and their consequences? As we have seen above, for avian influenza this is most of the time, for most situations. Here a narrow version of risk assessment is inadequate. Figure 3 offers a diagrammatic representation of this argument, distinguishing between different types of incertitude across two axes – knowledge about likelihoods and outcomes. It also highlights (in the arrows) the cognitive, procedural and institutional pressures that influence a move towards the top left hand corner, and a focus on a narrow approach risk assessment, and away from a more plural response to different types of incertitude; something, we argue, would be more appropriate for the avian influenza response.Figure 3. Responses to incertitude (from STEPS, 2008 – unpublished mimeo, originally from Andy Stirling)167 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.168 Interview, Washington DC, 12 June 2008.6766Knowledge about outcomesproblematicnot problematicKnowledge about likelihoodsnot problematicproblematicdecision rulesaggregatice analysisagenda-settingpolitical closuremodellingprobabilitiesrules of thumbinsurance indicators / metricsinstitutional remitslegal harm definitionslimited liabilityhorizon scansscenariosforesightdeliberationAMBIGUITYIGNORANCERISKUNCERTAINTYUnfortunately, as we have seen, in the avian influenza response the choice of metrics and indicators, as well as institutional pressures to define ‘harm’ or ‘liability’ in particular ways, move us from an acceptance of ‘ignorance’ to definitions based on uncertainty, where knowledge about outcomes are deemed less problematic. In the same way, foresight exercises or scenario plans move arguments to policy assessments where knowing the likelihood of an event appears to improve, although debates persist about outcomes. In this way, scenarios, horizon scans and wider public deliberation always throw up multiple options – and so ambiguity. Which one to choose? Wider agenda-setting processes and political imperatives – for action and certainty - often force closure around particular options, often without much further evidence, moving the analysis ever further towards the top-left corner, where knowledge about likelihoods and outcomes are deemed unproblematic, and amenable to risk management. This narrow risk framing is in turn reinforced by certain types of modelling which use probability estimates (or often actually informed guesswork) to move from uncertainty to a probabilistic risk assessment mode. Again, there are institutional and procedural pressures for this move: risk maps, decision models and insurance policies require such probabilistic assessments: fuzzy, complex uncertainty or ignorance just will not do. All these moves are reinforced by a set of disciplinary cultures which value quantitative, disease-focused assessments over more complex analyses of social, economic, political and ecological dynamics. In Rosenberg’s terms, the explanations are centred on ‘contamination’ not ‘configuration’; on outbreak events not complex disease dynamics. Understanding these disciplinary and professional biases needs to be at the heart of any analysis. A reconfiguring of disciplinary expertise and an involvement of alternative knowledges, including that of those directly affected by the disease, could, as we have suggested earlier, have a dramatic effect on the framing of the problem and the response, allowing alternative narratives into the picture. This would help to bring to the fore real uncertainties, ambiguities and forms of ignorance, and push policy to respond to these explicitly, rather than wishing such awkward, troublesome dimensions away. However, as it stands, a fairly standard, narrow risk framing – centred on three outbreak narratives – dominates the avian influenza response. This, as we have shown, emerges from a range of institutional, procedural and cognitive pressures, and not necessarily from ‘evidence’ per se. Science and policy is mutually constructed in a particular context that acts to include and exclude through the exertion of power through a range of institutional and professional practices. As previous sections have discussed, the three outbreak narratives we have outlined focus on a ‘risk framing’ (top-left corner), with often top-down, formulaic, ‘at source’ interventions following from it, backed up by a variety of mechanisms that claim to predict and provide risk-based assessments of early warning. These types of response are, as we have shown, reinforced by a set of biases which lie at the heart of response systems (and the agencies that oversee them): disciplinary, procedural, administrative, bureaucratic, organisational, funding, political, and more, as well as the public policy context within which such responses are manufactured, notably the role of the media, public trust in expert institutions and the political imperative to be seen to be doing something in an era of anxiety, worry and perceived threat.But does this matter? Many reading this will perhaps respond – well of course, that’s true, but so what? We would argue that it does matter, and that a narrow  risk framing that does not effectively acknowledge issues of uncertainty and ignorance – and the ambiguity of alternative interpretations of likelihood and outcome, can act to narrow our assessment and response in ways that may undermine the effectiveness and resilience of responses. How might this happen? For example, by focusing too much attention on (well acknowledged) inadequate information, surveillance and early warning systems, we may miss important shifts in disease ecology, and so we may be caught by surprise, with serious consequences. Alternative ways of thinking about surveillance might not have so much focus on reporting disease events and so constructing purported risk measures, but more on understanding of complex ecosystem change and holistic assessments. This may, in the end, result in better responses. Similarly, recognising the ambiguities, and inherent politics between different outcome scenarios may allow more concrete deliberation in policy circles around alternative, normative consequences for different options. In other words, asking who will be affected, where and with what implications for poverty? Such distributional questions associated with different disease responses should be seen as central to any discussion of policy, but tend to get occluded from the analysis by a universal risk framing.In the final section we will outline some of the implications of what we define as a ‘dynamics and distribution’ approach to tackling the ‘One World, One Health’ agenda in relation to some of the key avian influenza and pandemic threat intervention pathways. This section has highlighted how expertise and framing is central to such an endeavour, and being explicit about what we do know and what we don’t, and indeed being alert to the fact that we don’t know what we don’t know, is vital if a more resilient response system to new disease threats is to emerge. The current default of a narrow risk framing – even with all the qualifications – we argue is potentially dangerous, blanking out as it does through a range of discursive, institutional and cognitive moves important ambiguities, uncertainties and forms of ignorance. 696811. ONE WORLD, ONE HEALTH?CHALLENGES AND IMPLICATIONSThe One World, One Health agenda is certainly ambitious, combining animal, human and ecosystem health in one all-encompassing approach. For some this is far too big and unwieldy, potentially undermining the successes of the focused avian influenza response by trying to put too much into the pot. As one informant put it: “It’s a good catch phrase, but I am not sure what it means”169. Another observed: These concepts need to be narrow to be viable. One World, One Health is cast to cover everything. It sets the imagination off but it is more important to work out what is viable than come up with grand concepts. Avian influenza was a ‘brand’ if you like that could make a number of things happen. It allowed us to focus on something that was a tangible threat and source significant amounts of money from contingency funds. Talking about generic threats at the human-animal interface - zoonoses - is less arresting and makes it harder to draw funds down. The link with a possible human pandemic has focused things significantly170.For others, it is unquestionably the way forward, requiring a radical rethinking of the way we respond to international health questions. An enthusiast put it thus:What it [the avian influenza response] has done is wake the world up to the fact that large numbers of [new human] diseases - 75% of them - come from the animal kingdom. And the connections between animal health and human health are much more apparent I would argue now, than they were five years ago. People have seen the connections with SARS, ebola. This has really accentuated that171.The big danger, everyone agrees, is if this simply becomes a repackaging exercise: a desperate attempt to grab funds on the tail-end of the avian influenza bonanza by creating something that looks new. One cynic commented: “You’ll probably find that it was at one time called veterinary public health; it is in fact nothing new”172. The incentives for the default option are large. There are vested interests in what has become a status quo – well funded avian influenza programmes, propping up large groups of staff on short-term contracts, and mini-empires which have pushed certain departments and individuals into prominence. And many argue, with some justification as we have seen, that the avian influenza response has been successful and offers a good model for rolling out similar approaches to respond to a wider set of potential disease threats.  169 Interview, New York, 9 June 2008.170 Interview, New York, 10 June 2008.171 Interview, Washington DC, 11 June 2008.172 Interview, Washington DC, 13 June 2008.We argue, however, that if the ‘One World, One Health’ agenda is to have any traction, it must not simply be old wine in new bottles, no matter how enticing the prospect of new cash for activities that are fast running out of funding might be. Despite the tangible successes of the recent international response to avian influenza, we believe there are some important lessons that have been learned that require some fairly important shifts. In particular, by questioning the dominance (but not not the importance or the relevance) of the three ‘outbreak narratives’, we argue for an opening up of the overall framing to encompass the three alternative narratives – on veterinary and animal health issues, on human public health and on pandemic preparedness – discussed in section 6. This then requires new perspectives on appropriate organisational architectures, the understanding of ‘security’ and responses to uncertainty and ignorance, as sections 8 to 10 have argued. Here we identify ten challenges for the way ahead derived from our analysis. Again it should be emphasised that, by arguing for change, in most instances we are not arguing against existing approaches, but arguing for additions, extensions and nuances. MANAGING ENDEMIC SITUATIONSAs sections 4 and 5 highlighted, much of the current veterinary and public health response is framed by a strong ‘outbreak’ narrative that emphasises the disease event and the diseased area. A response strategy follows that focuses on disease eradication. This is clearly desirable, and an emergency/crisis response is of course appropriate in many areas. But in other places it is not: the ‘model’ response is not appropriate in all contexts. And these areas may be significantly larger and more important – for overall global disease dynamics – than originally thought. In areas where the disease is heavily entrenched, and effectively endemic, a different approach may be needed. This focuses on long-term prevention and managing endemism, rather than emphasising eradication pathways which may either be impossible or, worse, result in more rather than less disease because of the consequences of intervention measures.   EMBRACING UNCERTAINTYAs discussed in section 10, there are a variety of factors  embedded in the current response that result in the black-boxing or ignoring of uncertainty and ignorance, and the denial of ambivalence (or alternative perspectives). These are reinforced by institutional practices and the nature of expertise. But a simple risk framing – and risk management response – may not be enough. An approach that embraces uncertainty (and ignorance and ambivalence) may result in more effective and resilient response strategies. But this requires new forms of expertise, a more open approach to assessing evidence and designing responses, and new methods and practices to allow this to happen. This is a theme that cuts across all other areas, with profound consequences. 7170RETHINKING SURVEILLANCEThe ‘outbreak’ focus discussed above lends itself to a particular type of surveillance emphasising tracking disease events. This is essential and represents the basis of significant and important investment over recent years. But this, we argue, needs to be complemented by ‘systemic surveillance’ that looks at the dynamics of changing diseases and ecosystems, identifying triggers, dynamic shifts and potential new equilibria, as a range of variables in non-linear systems interact. Clearly this is a much more difficult task and would need a combination of broad ecosystem assessment with modelling work, and – critically – locally based information systems which pick up on local understandings of dynamic change. Surprise will always be present, but understanding complex dynamics may help us prepare for it in ways that are more comprehensive than often after-the-event disease tracking.A FOCUS ON ETHICS, EQUITY AND ACCESSMuch of the current debate has been framed in universal, global terms: this is a global threat requiring a global response. The One World, One Health banner can be seen in these terms too. But just beneath the surface – and occasionally popping above it to disturb the neat global consensus – are issues of equity and access. Choices of what to do, where and for whom (whose world, whose health?), inevitably frame and direct the pathways of response. If dominated, as to date, with largely northern concerns about ‘health security’, then a response pathway will emerge in a particular way (around the outbreak narratives we have discussed). But with other framings – say around poverty, equity and access – then a different response pathway will be more likely. Across this report, and reflecting the views of a number of many we discussed with, we have identified a more developmental focus as key for any future agenda. This emphasises not just ‘global’ health security and governance in a bland, universalist sense, where the politics of access and the structural inequalities inherent are obscured, but an agenda where this political economy is very much more central. This will require an explicit analysis of the social distribution of risks and rewards, as well as new voices at the table, resulting in a more inclusive approach to agenda setting. It will allow some agencies at the heart of the response – and in particular the FAO and WHO – to recapture some of their core mandates, and focus attention more explicitly on these issues.A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH SECURITYThis relates to a wider debate about the meanings and interpretations of ‘health security’ and ‘health governance’. As discussed, these have come to mean certain things, excluding other perspectives. This has happened almost by default through the unfolding of the policy process and the capture of the agenda by particular interests and perspectives. The global consensus – some would say fudge – has avoided debating these sensitive and highly charged topics, particularly as the major funders of the international response have very strong views. Unless a more thorough debate is conducted, this consensus will remain fragile and subject to disturbance. Alternative perspectives on security, particularly at the global level, need to be engaged with, including those developed under the auspices of the Oslo Declaration. A different vision of the relationship between health and foreign affairs may yet emerge, which the One World, One Health initiative could be a good vehicle for. This may offer a reinvention of the concepts of health security and health governance in ways that are less framed by post-9/11 concerns with national security, and consider a more holistic, development-oriented vision.RETHINKING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITIESAs we have seen, there is much talk about global governance set within assumptions of consensus, transparency and common vision. This universalist globalism is present in much of the discussion of the avian influenza response, yet often excludes difficult politics and competing interests, resulting in a rather anodyne version, largely unreflective of wider political processes. This global governance vision is enacted through grand mission statements and the instruments of multilateralism, but often comes unstuck when such perspectives are not in the interests of particular powerful worlds. Whether we live in a uni-polar world, one of new empires (Hardt and Negri 2000), a multi-polar one of diverse emergent powers (Huntington 1999), or a non-polar world where no-one has much influence anymore (Haass 2008) is a matter for much debate, and one that matters for how global responses to emerging threats such as new diseases are constructed. Assuming simple, universal, global consensus will get us nowhere, as policy regimes and instruments become either captured or obstructed. Thus, at the centre of any debate about ways forward, must be a searching – and politically-informed – look at the new configuration of power and interests globally, and the way that this affects our understandings of governance. Questions of who is accountable for what and to whom have been raised throughout this paper. This has often not been clear in the international response to date. Financial accountability has been assured through the regular reporting and monitoring by the World Bank, in relation to World Bank managed trust funds. UNSIC too has provided rigour, but the reporting and accountability relations to other organisations has often not been clear. And within agencies, systems exist for managing funds, controlling programmes and defining what is done too. But nearly all the accountability mechanisms identified refer to aid funds, and financial accounting systems. This is clearly important, given the huge amounts of money being spent, and such systems of upward accountability to donors has ensured that money has been accurately accounted for. But this misses out on other forms of auditing – both horizontal across organisations and downward to those people who the effort is supposed to be serving. In an international response with so many strands, this may be a tall order, but if ‘global’ only means accountability upwards to international donors, it then is little surprise that the effort becomes framed in 7372these terms. Getting a wider stakeholder group involved, beyond the formulaic and ritualised efforts of international ministerial meetings, must be a key challenge for any future efforts.  NEW ORGANISATIONAL ARRANGEMENTSSections 8 and 10 highlighted how developing organisational arrangements - and disciplinary, bureaucratic and other procedures - that can embrace surprise, deal with uncertainty and accept ignorance, as well as being more inclusive of diverse sources of knowledge and innovation, are essential. With the challenges stretching across ecosystem management, veterinary/animal production issues and human health and disease, some quite radical new configurations and incentive systems (if not organisations) will be required. For the UN, and international public system more generally, this will be a challenge. UN reform has been highlighted as an urgent requirement for decades. But perhaps this will be an important opportunity, revisiting mandates and capacities and revitalising the core UN agencies at the centre of any international disease response in ways that do not entrench existing interests, but allow more cross-agency working, flexibility and responsiveness. The avian influenza response has demonstrated some important successes in this regard, and the coordinating group, UNSIC, has in many respects offered an exemplary light-touch approach to facilitation, coordination and profile/fund raising across – and outside – the UN system. Caveats of course apply, and the danger of ‘mission creep’ and ‘institutional fossilisation’ are always present, but the metaphor of a ‘movement’, an alliance of creative and like-minded people pushing an agenda is one that perhaps should be maintained.  DISCIPLINARY AND PROFESSIONAL MIXESAs we have seen, the core international response has been dominated by a relatively narrow disciplinary and professional group – mostly vets and medics, and a few communications specialists. There have been others too of course, but largely on the margins. This has been seen as a fairly technical problem requiring a technical solution, and one framed by an ‘outbreak narrative’, where a disciplinary focus on ‘contamination’ (and eradication) trumps other ‘configurational’ perspectives, where livelihood contexts, dynamic ecologies and political economy become more important. The work by technical specialists focusing on the outbreak is clearly vital, and particularly revealing as understanding of molecular composition and genome dynamics increases173. But, as previous parts of this report have shown, these perspectives may narrow the analysis, and so constrain prognoses and recommendations. We would argue that the issues highlighted above – and widely recognised as important by nearly every informant we discussed with – require broader disciplinary and professional frames, and particularly more emphasis on 173 See, for example, Hatta et al (2001); Lee et al (2004). the social sciences as a route to understanding the contextual factors that influence disease dynamics and the effectiveness of different types of response. It was a surprise to us that, within the core agencies involved in the international response, there seemed to be such a limited array of expertise (and this is not just special pleading from authors who trained as an ecologist and psychologist and work on the social science of science-policy interactions!) But beyond extending the contributions of formal expertise, we would argue that another important challenge will be to democratise expertise, and extend the contributions of others, beyond the professions and outside the technical agencies and the academe, to people who are living with and managing diseases on a day-to-day basis. Exposing scientific and policy claims to a wide range of critique from diverse sources enhances scientific rigour and policy robustness. For, it is the strategies and cultural logics of people in disease-affected areas which must, in the end, ensure that disease control is effective. This will require a substantial shift in professional and organisational cultures, as current approaches often actively exclude and often dismiss such alternative forms of knowledge and expertise.  IMPROVING PROGRAMME DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATIONAs discussed in the rest of the paper, there have been many good investments as part of the international avian influenza response, with long term capacities improved in a range of areas, and with emergency preparedness, at least in some quarters, substantially enhanced. However, all admit there have also been gaps and inadequacies. There are also questions of opportunity costs: could the money have been spent on something else? Are there other more pressing priorities that have missed out? The country studies that are being conducted as part of the wider study174 are revealing the complexity of programme design and implementation in particular places in South East Asia, as well as the wider politics of resource allocation at a national level. Bigger questions are being raised about aid effectiveness in areas where there is weak state capacity and high levels of corruption. Competition over aid resources can create highly distorting effects, and the desired cooperation and collaboration across government departments, the private sector, NGOs and civil society simply does not happen. Despite the increasing coherence and integration at the international level, at the country level barriers and divides generally remain as present as ever. The traditional vertical programme approach for sectoral interventions remains the preferred model. This attracts resources, and may generate rents. A cross-sectoral or sector-wide approach has proved less enticing, and much of the effort on the ground has remained fragmented and duplicative. For this reason, a more targeted approach to programming is needed, taking in a cross-sectoral approach and attuned to local circumstance and particular local political and policy contexts. There has been a tendency for a one-size-fits-all approach, where global expertise defines strategies towards disease control or public education and communication. These 174 See www.steps-centre.org/ourresearch/avianflu.html.7574simple approaches have often not worked well, and have to be adapted in ad hoc ways. Making a feature of an adaptive and responsive approach up-front makes more sense. This accepts the principles of subsidiarity, decentralised control in design and implementation to the lowest level appropriate. This encourages a more participative approach to programme design, avoiding the worst problems of a technical, top-down, vertical programming approach. ASSESSING SUCCESS AND IMPACTCentral to any endeavour is having a vision of success – and with this some indicators of impact. Such visions and indicators of course follow on directly from the narratives at the centre of any policy response. Thus for the outbreak narratives that dominate the international avian influenza response, the vision is firmly one which centres on disease control, eradication, the prevention of avian outbreaks and so the prevention of a human pandemic. Indicators follow, focused on disease events and incidence. But such a narrative of course, as discussed, misses out on other alternative perspectives, focused on complex disease dynamics, poverty impacts, equity and access. These suggest very different indicators and measures of success or impact. In sum, there is very little clarity about what success is (beyond the obvious need to avoid a major human pandemic), and in practice success is often measured in terms of financial disbursement and completion of project activities. We suggest that there is an urgent need for a more thorough and on-going debate about ‘theories of change’ (or narratives in the language of this report) and indicators that are meaningful. As an outline for an agenda for action for the One World, One Health initiative, Table 1 provides a summary of the above discussion, highlighting ten areas for action which, we suggest, need to be addressed if the initiative is to really improve the world’s ability to respond to future, uncertain zoonotic disease threats in ways that are effective, equitable and resilient.THEME FOCUS FOR THE HPAI RESPONSECHALLENGES FOR THE ONE WORLD, ONE HEALTH AGENDAOutbreaks and endemismOutbreak: disease events and diseased areasMore emphasis on dynamic drivers for  emerging diseases and endemic contextsRisk and uncertaintyRisk – and risk managementThe implications of uncertainty, ignorance and ambiguity need attentionSurveillance and informationDisease incidence and outbreak trackingMore focus on underlying dynamics of change, across a range of factors to identify  likely ‘hot spots’ and emergent diseasesEthics, equity and accessEthical, distributional and access issues not centralQuestions of equity and who gets access  vital, asking whose world, whose health?Health security A protectionist, national security stanceA more inclusive, rights-based human security visionGlobal governance and accountabilitiesA universalist, consensual globalism, with upward accountabilities to donors (largely)A more politically realistic perspective on governance, recognising different interests and agendas, alongside a more  inclusive form of downward accountabilityOrganisational arrangementsLead technical agencies with defined mandates, backed up with an efficient funding mechanism and light-touch coordinationBuilding on the model, aiming for ‘optimal redundancy’ without too much overlap and avoiding forced integration, but maintaining a nimble, flexible coordination ‘movement’Disciplines and professionsVeterinary and health professionals dominateNeed for more ecologists, epidemiologists, economists and social scientists, including anthropologists, sociologists and political scientists.

"Three reports prepared for TAC on marginal lands: the report of a panel asked to look at research priorities, and follow up studies on prioritizing land types, and the relationship between rural poverty and land degradation. The document contains an excerpt from the summary of CGIAR ICW 99, a transmittal from the TAC Chair, and TAC's commentary.'The Report of the Study on CGIAR Research Priorities for Marginal Lands' (March 1997) by a panel chaired by Michael Nelson explores the interaction between poverty and land quality. Faced with conceptual and data problems, the panel rejected the assumption that poor people were overly concentrated in low potential areas, and focused on how the CGIAR might more systematically address poverty alleviation. It recommended creation of a database linking poverty to biophysical land conditions. New forms of partnership and new approaches would be needed to address the needs of poor people living in marginal areas, the impacts of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on natural resources, the linkages between poverty and resource degradation, and the reasons why improved technology often remained unused. The panel recognized that it was recommending a broadening of research that would require increased resources.'A Framework for Prioritizing Land Types in Agricultural Research' (August 1998) prepared on behalf of TAC by Ted Henzell, develops the principles of land classification from the Marginal Lands Study into a conceptual framework for more general use in CGIAR priority-setting.'Rural Poverty and Land Degradation: A Reality Check for the CGIAR' (August 1998) by Sohail Malik reviews the literature on the relationship between rural poverty and land degradation, and implications for priority setting by CGIAR centers.This subject was on the agenda of TAC at every meeting from TAC 70 through TAC 77, and was considered at the CGIAR meeting in October 1999"

D.C. December 1999 Efforts to Explore New Scientific Directors to Impact Poverty’ CGIAR Research Priorities for Marginal Lands Mike Nelson, chair of the panel commissioned by TAC to study CGIAR research priorities for marginal lands, presented the panel’s findings and recommendations. The panel reviewed the conventional thinking about the nature of marginal lands, the concentration of rural poverty on such lands, the linkage between poverty and accelerated resource degradation, and the CGIAR’s role in poverty alleviation on these lands. The panel did not have the data to quantify the numbers of rural poor on areas specified by the sets of elements which explain why they are marginal. Thus the panel’s conclusions are general and no specific inferences are drawn on potential gains in poverty alleviation from research investment on marginal lands to develop new technologies, j understand farm and off-farm linkages in family survival strategies, and assess constraints and opportunities for changes in policies and institutions seen as hindering poverty alleviation. The panel made four recommendations regarding CGIAR work in marginal areas. l The CGIAR should sharpen its strategic focus on poverty alleviation, particularly in setting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas. l Centers should establish new partnerships to effectively address their roles in a broader poverty alleviation strategy for those who live in marginal areas. : l The CGIAR should develop improved mechanisms to generate and imerpret scientific evidence on the extent and magnitude of agriculture’s impact on resource degradation or enhancement and the linkage between poverty and resource degradation. l Centers and their partners should expand collaborative mechanisms to adapt and utilize heretofore-unused research results. TAC Chair Donald Winkelmann presented the TAC commentary. TAC’s overall conclusion is that the information is generally lacking to support the presumption that the ’ Extract from “Summary of Proceedings and Decisions - Report on Parallel Session I”, International Centres Week, Washington, D.C.

The evidence neither confirms nor rejects the conventional wisdom that most of the rural poor are located in areas characterized by marginal lands and that marginal lands are more susceptible to resource degradation. It is simply inconclusive. More research, sometimes specific to a target area, is needed before marginal areas can be targeted to achieve CGIAR objectives and before research allocation schemes are developed that take land types into account. Plenary Decisions Members noted the panel’s difficulties in showing casual links between poverty and land degradation and whether targeting degraded land selectively also targets poverty. It was noted that the panel’s analysis indicates that some marginal lands have significant potential for research-driven productivity increases, so that returns on investment in those areas could surQass the short-term potential in more favored areas. Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE Donald Winkelmann, Chairman September 30, 1999 Dear Mr. Serageldin, I am pleased to transmit to you the reports of TAC’s Study on Marginal Lands. The Study comprises four papers: the first was prepared by a Panel chaired by Dr. Mike Nelson and is entitled Report of the Study on CGIAR Research Priorities for Marginal Lands; the second was prepared by Dr. Ted Henzell and the TAC Secretariat and is entitled A Frameworkfor Prioritizing Land Types in Agricultural Research; the third was prepared by a Consultant to the TAC Secretariat, Dr. Sohail Malik, and is entitled Rural Poverty and Land Degradation: A Reality Checkfor the CGIAR; TAC’s Commentary on this Study is the fourth paper. This is an especially rich mixture of papers, the last two of them stimulated by the ideas emerging from the first. The collection has strong implications for the way the System prioritizes its efforts on less favoured environments. The overall conclusion of the Study is that the information available is insufficient to support the presumption that the character of marginal lands can be used to set research priorities that meet CGIAR objectives. In its commentary, TAC refers to a number of immediate implications of the results of this Study for Centre and System research planning. The Committee also raises a number of issues which will guide analysis of future resource allocation decisions. On behalf of TAC, I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Mike Nelson and the members of his Panel, and Drs. Ted Henzell and Sohail Malik for their excellent work. I look forward to a stimulating discussion at ICW’99. Kind regards, Sincerely Yours, Donald L.

Palace Avenue, Santa Fe, NM 87501 (l-505) 988-1284 FAX: (l-505) 988-1285 tacwink@newmexico.com TAC Commentary on the CGIAR Study on Marginal Lands I. Motivations for the Marginal Lands Study CGIAR research is driven by the objectives of reducing poverty, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainability in the management of natural resources such as biodiversity, land, and water. The instruments it uses to achieve these goals are the provision and diffusion (particularly through training) of technological and institutional innovations to enhance the productivity and the sustainability of use of land and other natural resources. The technological innovations which the CGIAR generates tend to be specific to particular biophysical contexts: while some innovations are broadly generic, particularly if they pertain to fundamental research, most are applicable to specific contexts defined by a broad set of biological and physical features. For rural poverty reduction, contextual specificity then raises the possibility of targeting the rural poor by focusing research on the geographical areas with biophysical features where the poor are most heavily concentrated. Poverty concentration would mean not that there is a high incidence of poverty among the population in that area (where population may be very scarce), but that there is a high percentage of all rural poor located in the area. If, as conventional wisdom has it, most of the rural poor are located in areas characterized by marginal lands, then focusing CGIAR research on technological innovations for marginal lands would be an effective way of achieving the goal of rural poverty reduction. If, in addition, marginal lands are more susceptible to resource degradation, then the objective of sustainable natural resources management (NRM) would also be well served by focusing research on these areas. Also, if the poor themselves are a source of environmental degradation, and as poverty shortens time horizons and constrains the adoption of instruments that would enhance conservation, then technological innovations for marginal lands can help achieve win-win outcomes, with synergy between the goals of poverty reduction and sustainable NRM. Finally, if we suspect that there has been an initial under- investment by the CGIAR in research for marginal areas, i.e., over-investment in Green Revolution varieties that favoured the complementary input package found mainly in areas of high quality land, then a high uncaptured potential return to research on marginal lands may exist. Because this argument apparently offered much promise, TAC took initiatives to address the issue through systematic analysis of existing evidence. Interest in the issue was prompted by recommendations derived from the February 1995 ministerial-level meeting held in Lucerne, and the IFPRI 2020 Vision paper, that the CGIAR should “ensure that its research programmes address the problems of the poor in less-endowed areas, in addition to continuing its work on high potential areas”. This international concern for the less-endowed areas was driven by perceptions that the CGIAR’s research efforts have done little for the poor in biophysically marginal lands, that most of the poor live in areas which are ecologically fragile, and that they are a cause and consequence of a downward spiral of resource degradation and deepening poverty. TAC appointed a distinguished panel of experts, chaired by Dr. Mike Nelson, to look into the validity of the presumptions. The Committee also appointed a separate consultant, Dr. Sohail Malik, to review specifically what is known about the relationship between rural poverty and land degradation. These two documents prompted a response by Dr. Ted Henzell who proposed an 2 alternative framework for prioritizing land types for the allocation of CGIAR research funds. These studies, sponsored by TAC, constitute a strategic initiative designed at improving the CGIAR’s ability to set priorities and allocate resources to research. Marginal or fragile land was defined as land that is sensitive to degradation as a result of human intervention, and degraded land as land that has lost part of, or its entire, productive capacity as a result of human intervention. The overall conclusion of this effort is that information is generally lacking to support the presumption that the character of marginal lands could be used to set research priorities that focus clearly on poverty alleviation. This, in itself, is an interesting conclusion since it calls into question conventional wisdom, which if followed, would lead to erroneous decision-making in allocating research resources. The evidence neither confirms nor rejects the conventional wisdom; it is simply inconclusive. This in turn suggests fertile areas for future research which the CGIAR and others concerned with poverty should address. II. Results from the Marginal Lands Studies The Nelson Panel concluded that there is “an abysmal lack of data” to validate the two presumptions that motivated the study, i.e., (1) that marginal lands support a high proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor, and (2) that the poor are the prime cause of resource degradation in marginal agricultural lands. In addition, it does not appear correct to say that the CGIAR under-invested research funds for these lands, even though there is no impact analysis showing whether these investments were effective for the goal of rural poverty reduction. We note too that there is still some confusion in characterizihg poverty in marginal lands between incidence of poverty (it does not appear to be higher in these lands relative to favourably endowed lands) and number of poor (it appears to be higher in more favoured lands simply because population densities are so much higher than in marginal lands). Clearly, as far as the CGIAR is concerned, the second type of measure is the relevant one. Data, however, remain inconclusive on both measures of poverty and the Panel concluded that further research using available evidence could not disentangle these issues. It concluded that the focus on marginal lands may not be appropriate in guiding the CGIAR’s strategy toward poverty alleviation. In seeking an alternative concept to help target CGIAR research using a geographical criterion, the Panel proposed the idea of “marginal area”. Such area is defined as a geographical unit characterized by a high incidence of “marginal people” and relatively homogeneous determinants of poverty. As TAC understands it, “marginal people” refers to marginalized people, with poverty as the dominant common consequence of marginalisation. Starting hence from marginality, the question is whether one can identify relatively homogeneous regions in terms of causation of poverty, whether the region is characterized by marginal lands or not. It would seem correct to start the analysis f?om poverty, identifying the many determinants of poverty, and potentially singling out the quality of the biophysical environment as one of these determinants. If the biophysical determination of poverty turned out to be sufficiently strong, then a research effort to generate technological innovations for these areas would be justified. On the other hand, among the other determinants of poverty, there may be indicators that could prove to be more powerful than land type in setting research priorities to 2 reduce rural poverty. Since data are generally not available, the validity of the Panel’s proposed alternative criterion remains to be tested. Lack of data may seem surprising since the World Bank has run extensive Living Standard Measurement Surveys with the objective of tracking poverty. These data, however, were not collected in association with relevant biophysical characteristics. Hence, statistical representation is not achieved over geographical units that can be characterized as marginal lands, and geographical representation is over regions that are in general too broad and heterogeneous to usefully fit a biophysical characterisation. Based on these findings, the Nelson Panel made four recommendations. The first recommendation is that “the CGIAR needs to sharpen its strategic focus on poverty allevianon, particularly in setting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas.’ A prerequisite is development of a geo-referenced database linking land‘conditions with poverty and the processes that produce it (i.e., the dynamics of poverty)“. TAC endorses this recommendation. The CGIAR should in particular use the expertise in the now operational. Consortium on Spatial Information (CSI) which TAC was instrumental in helping organ&e. This consortium has as one of its major objectives the improved mapping of the locus and level of poverty. TAC consequently intends to be a conscientious observer and potentially ‘an active p,articipant in the work of CSI and to play a role in using results from this work to guide the CGIAR toward better spatially targeted resource allocations. Recommendation 2 is that ‘Centres should establish new forms of partnership in order to effectively address their role in a broader poverty alleviation strategy related to those who live in marginal areas”. TAC concurs with the Panel that the determinants of poverty are multiple, that poverty reduction consequently requires focusing on an array of sources of income that go beyond agriculture, and that this should be achieved via partnerships with organizations engaged in combating poverty with other instruments. The CGIAR is partially addressing this recommendation through its ecoregional approach to research and also through the Systemwide Programme on Participatory Research and Gender Analysis for Technology .Development and Institutional Innovation, but greater efforts clearly need to be made toward implementing this recommendation, e.g. with those studying income from off-farm employment. Recommendation 3 is that the CGIAR System should “develop improved mechanisms by which Centres can be involved with other partners in generating and interpreting improved scientific evidence on (1) the extent and magnitude of the impacts of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries on the degradation or enhancement of natural resources and the consequences for production, and food security; and (2) the linkage between poverty and observed resource degradation”. TAC is indeed concerned that insufficient resources are devoted to.problems of soil and water degradation apart from the corresponding Systemwide undertaking. This recommendation deseties further consideration by TAC. Meanwhile, IAEG is undertaking a special study to identify the determinants of these gaps and opportunities for intervention. Finally, recommendation 4, is that “expanded collaborative mechanisms and activities should be developed among Centres and between Centres and their non-CGIAR partners, to help focus research and institution strengthening on issues related to adoption, adaptation, and 4 utilization *of research results that so far have remained unused”. Existence of a continued backlog of un- or under-used research results has indeed been a long-standing concern, and most particularly in the field of NRM. This issue is addressed in the Review of Systemwide Programmes with an Ecoregional Approach (SDR/TAC:IAR/99/8). Because the Nelson Panel was unable to fully address the question of links between rural poverty and land degradation, TAC asked Dr. Sohail Malik to review available literature on the subject. His report concluded with a note of caution about our ability to verify this relationship. He wrote that “understanding of the intricate process of poverty and land degradation is extremely limited. Definition, in each process, is driven largely by the perceptions of those analysing the phenomena. The lack of clear conceptualization, the observed: heterogeneity, and the diverse perceptions of those attempting the exercise complicate attempts at measurement. The aggregate information available is not very useful for making judgements about poverty and land degradation. Evidence from the few available micro-level studies is mixed. and contradictory. Much more research in a variety of settings over a reasonable length of time is needed for deeper understanding of household (and community) decision-making processes, especially in terms of the relationship with land. The CGIAR is well placed to support such research”. TAC agrees with this observation and recommendation. There is clearly no simplistic characterization of the link between- poverty and natural resource degradation. What is needed is a set of conditional statements on this link that establish when the relation may hold or not and why. This defines an important research area which the CGIAR is well placed to address. Ill. Toward a Framework for Prioritizing Land Types in Agricultural Research Developing methodologies for the allocation of resources to research is a fundamental responsibility of TAC. In its own approach to resource allocation, TAC uses a formula that considers the poverty weighted value of commodities and sectors, subjectively weighted by the probability of success in research, themselves based on an assessment of changes in science. The Nelson Panel addressed the issue of how to take into account the category of land (particularly marginal versus favoured agricultural lands) in allocating resources. It proposed a two-way classification of lands, with the present value of land use on one axis and the potential for expansion of production through research on the other. Marginal agricultural lands with high potential to expand production based on research would thus deserve attention. This framework was generalized by Dr. Ted Henzell using as classification dimensions the value of present use of a land type and the potential benefits fi-om investment in agricultural research. Benefits from and value of use can thus go beyond production to include, for example, total factor productivity, poverty reduction, and indicators of natural resource management. These frameworks present ways to consider the problem. Their implementation is still far beyond what can be done at the moment, for the very same reasons that prevented the Nelson Panel and the Malik study from reaching conclusions about the meaning of marginal lands for targeting CGIAR research in fulfihnent of its objectives. Data on the mapping between land types and poverty are largely missing, and studies of the potential impact of research on each land type are incomplete. Hence, developing and implementing a camework for prioritizing land types in agricultural research will have to wait for the required information to become available. To a 5 large extent, the type of information that becomes available will determine the framework that can be used. IV. Conclusions and Future Research The TAC study on marginal lands has shown that more research, sometimes specific to a target area, is needed before those marginal areas can be targeted to achieve CGIAR objectives and before research resource allocation schemes are developed that take land types into account. The Committee consequently recommends that such decisions be deferred until further information becomes available. At the same time, Centres and others should be encouraged to engage in research that accelerates generation of this information since it remains a fundamental issue for the CGIAR. TAC itself has a direct interest in accessing this information in order to improve its instruments for resource allocation in the CGIAR. It will consequently be looking for opportunities to expedite the generation of this information within the limits of its role and resources. Meanwhile, TAC underlines the need for broadly based agricultural growth as a prerequisite for poverty reduction. The study on Marginal Lands has several immediate implications for Centre and System research planning. l At the global level, the lack of correlation between land resource endowments and poverty, based on available data, has led TAC, with Member approval, to propose a logfiame classification that does not separate outputs by land type at the System level. However, Centres are encouraged to consider specific targeting at the ecoregional level where evidence supports the belief that the correlation between the ecoregion and poverty may hold. l Given the lack of proof of causal effects between poverty and land degradation, it is logical to proceed on the assumption that threatening land use practices and technologies cause resource degradation irrespective of who employs them. The targeting of degraded land does not selectively target poverty in most instances. l The analysis indicates that there are areas of marginal land that may, in fact, have a significant potential for research-driven productivity increases, and that the returns on investment in these areas may equal or surpass short-term potential on more favoured areas. Targeting of resources on these lands should consequently help the allocation of resources in terms of productivity gains. l To optimize the allocation of research funds between marginal and favoured agricultural lands for the purpose of poverty reduction, the key criterion is the marginal effect of research expenditures on poverty in each type of land. To date, there is little evidence of the measurement of these marginal effects and this issue deserves urgent attention. l Lessons should be drawn from CGIAR success stories in marginal areas, specifically, in identifying those factors (e.g., technical assistance, access to credit) which complement centre research to enable poor farmers to adopt technological innovations in marginal areas. l Investment in GIS applications would have significant payoff in assisting the targeting of marginal resource ecoregions with potential for productivity increase, and in identifying areas of poverty and marginal lands. 6 TAC closes its report by raising four key issues which will guide future research and resource allocation decisions for reducing poverty directly and indirectly: 1. Potential of biotechnoloav and aaroforestrv for the marginal lands One of the defining features of the Green Revolution was that the new seeds fared better with complementary input packages including water, fertilizers, and chemicals for crop protection. Hence, there was complementarity between the new technologies and quality of the resource endowment. For this reason, Green Revolution innovations tierle better suited for favoured agricultural lands, and research for marginal lands appeared to offer a lower rate of return. Subsequent innovations, with a perspective on the poor and marginal lands, sought to help substitute for resources rather than pursuing complementarities. These innovations can, for example, complement pesticide use (genetic resistance), fertilizers (nitrogen fixation), tillage practices, and water (drought resistance). Biotechnology, e.g., genetic maps and markers, possibly GMOs, noti offers the promise of making it faster and less costly to achieve these goals. Following this logic, technological innovations derived .via biotechnology and applied to particular contexts through GIS mapping may promise higher rates of return for marginal areas than earlier technology did. How this potential will materialize thus deserves significant attention. . In deciding on research investments for marginal lands, the comparative advantage of these regions needs to be carefully established. Some evidence from Asia points at the potential . of agroforestry and of the production of cash crops as activities that have such a comparative advantage. In its efforts to reduce rural poverty, the CGIAR could consider extending its current portfolio to include activities with high potential for poverty reduction in marginal lands. 2. Determinants of novertv Poverty in marginal lands is a complex phenomenon, where access to productive assets, public goods investments, institutional arrangements, and cultural and social factors are all important determinants. Hence,. a cautious analysis of the determinants of rural poverty in marginal areas needs to be made, with a full accounting of the role of different factors including the biophysical context and the. technological practices used. Caution, however, must be exercised as a technological solution may not be the cost effective answer. It is quite possible that other constraints are more limiting on welfare than productivity in resource use as determined by technology. Hence, a comprehensive effort needs to be made to identify the specific determinants of poverty in marginal lands as well as the return from investing in agricultural research compared to other types of interventions such as infi-astructure, improved control over assets (human capital in particular), and designing the institutional f&nework. Understanding the potential of agricultural technology for the marginal areas consequently deserves a broad interdisciplinary effort before resources are committed to research on technological innovations specialized to these areas. Given the large degree of heterogeneity of situations, this research needs to be done at the local and regional level, followed by comparative analysis to seek broader generalizations. 0 7 3. Locus and manninp of the noor Having access to reliable and well-documented data on the number and location of the poor is essential in identifying viable strategies to alleviate poverty. Several institutions are already engaged in activities to identify specific areas of poverty concentration and to map their agroecological characteristics. CGIAR Members should actively support their efforts and ensure that a coordinated and comprehensive plan is followed. 4. Marginal Lands and Water Inadequate attention has been given to research issues related to marginal lands potential, defined in relation to water, cost of trade supporting infrastructure, and distance to markets. The CGIAR is well positioned to address water/land/poverty linkages beyond irrigation. Water insecurity appears to be a main poverty feature in marginal lands of arid areas and hillsides. Improvement efforts for marginal lands should continue to recognize explicitly the scope for supply and demand of water, the management of its use, and access to water especially by the poor.

CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL, RESEARCH TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE REPORT OF THE STUDY ON CGIAR RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOR MARGINAL LANDS TAC SECRETARIAT FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS March 1997 Casilla 209- 12 Santiago CHILE 3 March 1997 ’ Dear Dr. Winkelmann, I am pleased to submit the report on CGIAR Priorities for Marginal Lands. The earlier version discussed at TAC 71 has been revised in light of that discussion and further exchange of views among members of the Panel. The revision is based exclusively on clarification of the concept of “marginal land” which changed drastically between Phase I and II and was modified further in the final report as a result of the above discussions. In consequence, Chapters 1 to 3 of the Phase II report were changed. However, the strategic elements (Chapters 5, 6 and 7) and the overall conclusions remain essentially unchanged. At the outset I would like to trace the evolution of the Panel’s thinking, starting from four tenets of conventional wisdom on: the nature of marginal lands; the concentration of rural poverty on such lands; the linkage between poverty and accelerated resource degradation; and the role of CGIAR research in poverty alleviation on these lands. This line of thinking holds that: marginal lands are defined in biophysical terms which establish them as: having low inherent productivity for agriculture; being susceptible to degradation; and involving high risks for agricultural production; they support a high proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor; the combination of fragility and high density of poor people who place a premium on current consumption (resulting in over-exploitation of natural resources) is leading to accelerated erosion or vegetation destruction; the consequence is a downward spiral of poverty and resource degradation with significant negative externalities; the impact of CGIAR research on agricultural productivity increase, environmental protection and, above all, poverty alleviation, has been limited on these areas. . ./2 Dr. Donald Winkelmann Chair Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) 355 East Palace Avenue Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA ii These ideas underlie the terms of reference (TOR) for the study and was fully adopted by the Panel and the TAC Secretariat in the initial stages of their work. It provided the basis for design of the extensive data collection and analysis undertaken by the Secretariat to quantify marginal biophysical characteristics, rural population and rural poor living on these areas, and CGIAR expenditures devoted to research on productivity increase (agriculture, forestry and fisheries), post-harvest activities and options for removal of institutional constraints, all of which were expected to contribute to poverty alleviation on “marginal lands” as defined by their biophysical characteristics. The Panel subsequently rejected the first three tenets, but in dlefining marginal agricultural lands (MALs) relevance and credibility are implicitly assigned to both the concept that such lands can be defined solely by biophysical characteristics, and the project characteristics and expenditures (applied to MALs so defined) can be derived from the CGIAR project database. The bottom line is the Panel’s conclusion that neither the gldbal and regional quantification of marginal land areas (based on biophysical data), nor the assessment of CGIAR projects and expenditures assignable to these various land areas, a.re relevant to the CGIAR’s decision on strategy for poverty alleviation. In the final report, the marginal land issue is clarified by introducing the concept of “marginal areas” (MA) as being those where there are concentrations of marginal rural people and where the definition of geographic area would derive from a set of relatively homogeneous variables deemed lto generate rural poverty. Biophysical characteristics would be one element in the equation, This definition of marginal lands led the Panel to diverge from the original TOR. It clearly did not have the data to quantify the numbers of rural poor on areas specified by the sets of elements which explain why they are marginal. Thus the conclusions, in contrast to the expected output of the study, are general. No specific inferences are drawn on potential poverty alleviation gains from research investment on MAs to develop new technologies, understand farm and off-farm linkages in family survival strategies, and assess constraints and opportunities for change in the policy and institutional environment which may be seen as hindering poverty alleviation. Further, the Panel felt it was not in a position to assess the appropriate balance between CGIAR research investment targeted to MAs and to non-MAs. This step would follow from a clarification of where marginal people are, why they are marginal, and the options open to the System in addressing poverty in MAs. On behalf of myself and the Panel I would like to express appreciation once again for the opportunity to address a small but challenging segment of the issues faced by the CGIAR, and for the chance to work with the Secretariat and members of the Committee.

The final point in the terms of reference called for suggested priorities for research on these lands and an assessment of the appropriate balance of effort between marginal and favoured lands (FL). As it delved into the issues, the Panel discovered there was: considerable confusion on definitions and concepts of marginality; a strong body of conventional wisdom on the relationship between poverty, marginal lands (ML) and resource degradation, the role of the CGIAR in poverty alleviation, and the potential of ML to produce food; and an abysmal lack of data to validate this conventional wisdom. As a consequence the study has focused exclusively on strategic questions bearing on how the CGIAR might more systematically address poverty alleviation. In the process the Panel felt obliged to diverge from the initial hypothesis that research strategy would be determined primarily by the biophysical characteristics of ML. Perceptions Driving International Concern with ML The concern of the Lucerne Declaration that the CGIAR ensure that its research programmes address the problems of the poor in less-endowed areas derives from widely held views on the nature and scope of the issue. The axis is that research efforts by the System have done little for the poor on biophysically marginal .lands. * The view that most of the poor live in these fragile areas and are a cause and consequence of a downward spiral of resource degradation and deepening poverty, lends urgency to corrective action. Definition of strategy with respect to overall allocation of resources within ML and between ML and FL would require: forecasts of the poor, and the rate of resource degradation with associated yield decline and externalities; and an estimation of the potential poverty alleviation impact and the related environmental protection impact of research options applicable to both ML and FL. These premises and requirements were taken as the point of departure for the study. Definitions and Concepts Marginal lands: In order to provide a basis for mapping ML by biophysical characteristics, from which one could go on to determine numbers and incidence of rural poor and production potential for each area, the TAC Secretariat undertook an extensive analysis of existing data leading to a six-quadrant matrix of three land types: FL, ML and lands in low or zero intensity use (LZI), each sub-divided into two areas - those with a high expectation of a productivity response to research and those with a low expectation of response. The results from this exercise did not provide operationally relevant criteria for CGIAR decisions. Accordingly, a second approximation was made whereby biophysical characteristics establishing marginality were qualified by their current use in agriculture. This yielded estimates for favoured agricultural lands (FAL) - 800 million ha - and marginal agricultural lands (MAL) - 1,800 million ha. X Locution and incidence of rural poverty: From the above figures estimates were made of rural population on the two land types - 930 million on FAL and 1,760 million on MAL. No data are available for rural poor on each land type. However, from examination of data on poverty incidence in countries with high and low :proportions of MAL and available case studies, there is no evidence that poverty incidence is higher on MAL than FAL. Applying available estimates of rural poverty incidence to rural population on these two land types results in 325 million poor on FAL (35 %) and 630 million (65 %) on MAL. Role of the CGIAR in MAL: A review of the project portfolio suggests that about two-thirds of the System’s resources are invested in research relevant to MAL. But there are no data on what may be targeted to poverty alleviation. The centres have had many successes on marginal lands. If one accepts the above proportion of investment in MAL as well as the view of limited research impact on poverty, then a question of cost-effectiveness clearly arises. However, there is no evidence to support or refute the latter view. It is nevertheless a key question which can only be addressed by progressive accumulation of information along the lines proposed in Recommendation 1 discussed below. Poverty and resource degradation: There is no evidence to support the view implying that the poor are the prime cause of resource degradation on MAL. Again, clarification of this issue would derive from data assembled in response to Recommendation 1 and the study called for in the TAC Soil and Water Study to address “myths” on linkages between poverty, resource degradation and externalities. From Marginal Lands to Marginal People In reviewing the data presented above on the location of poverty, poverty incidence and the allocation of CGIAR resources to MAL and FAL, the Panel came to the conclusion that the inconsistencies and lack of data on the underlying site-specific forces driving the poverty process were such as to invalidate their usefuhress in guiding strategy towards poverty alleviation on marginal lands. The concept identified as relevant to evaluation of strategy was “marginal area” (MA), which is defined firstly by presence of high numbers and high incidence of marginal people, and secondly is subject to a relatively homogeneous set of conditions which explain why they are poor - institutions, policy, infrastructure, human capital, biophysical characteristics of land, etc. This definition of the “unit of account” for analytical purposes poses two problems for the CGIAR: by redefining the issues in terms of MA which may incorporate any combination of ML and FL, poverty alleviation is being placed in a global context, thus moving away from the original intent to deal only with poverty on ML MAs, by definition, will be site-specific and likely to be heterogeneous, and subject to more internal diversity, complexity and institutional constraints than would be expected for non-MAs. This is information-intensive and clearly xi presents a challenge in structuring research to provide international public goods. It also establishes a context for poverty alleviation which goes beyond what the System is now doing or is likely to do. The Panel is aware that over the past two years the CGIAR has fully adopted poverty alleviation as the objective of its research efforts and the MA approach proposed may be regarded as merely a restatement of this commitment. Nevertheless, it is felt that working through the ML/MAL/MA sequence has highlighted a number of dimensions which clarify strategic questions on approach - the data gaps (poverty/resource degradation linkages, poverty processes), targeting marginal rural people and site-specific characteristics of MAs which condition the relevance of research. The Panel is convinced that the System must come to grips with the site specificity and both the biophysical and non-biophysical elements which explain poverty if it is to design research in expectation that poverty impact can be evaluated. The entry point to an evolving strategy derives from Recommendation 1: The CGIAR needs to sharpen its strategic focus on poverty alleviation, particularly in setting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas. A prerequisite is development of a geo-referenced database linking biophysical land conditions with poverty and the processes that produce it (i.e. the dynamics of poverty). The focus on poverty alleviation in marginal areas involves challenges in identification, development and organization of research. Chief among these is the need to develop new forms of partnerships with NARS, NGOs, developed’ country institutions and multi and bilateral agencies. The CGIAR’s role will be restricted, albeit important. The key to success is establishment of the right kinds of partnerships, hence: Recommendation 2: The centres should establish new forms of partnership in order to effectively address their roles in a broader poverty alleviation strategy related to those who live in marginal rural areas. System Research on MAs The research thrust on poverty alleviation is seen to be in three inter-related areas: Institutional and policy change: Work in this area has been covered by other TAC studies on social science, institutional, policy and management research. The main focus is on analyses of: poverty processes; opportunities and constraints to institutional change; and viable options for improving welfare within existing constraints. Generating new and improved technologies: Technologies need to fit the institutional and socio-economic characteristics as well as biophysical conditions of MAs. Diversifying land use systems and income opportunities: Research will follow lines already established for natural resource management and clarification of xii linkages between resource degradation and poverty. The focus would incorporate diversification of production from renewable resources and off-farm income opportunities. Two recommendations derive from the above research agenda: Recommendation 3: The CGIAR System should develop improved mechanisms by which centres can be involved with other partners in generating and interpreting improved scientific evidence on (i) the extent and magnitude of the impacts of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on the degradation or enhancement of natural resources and the consequences for production and food security; and (ii) the linkage between poverty and observed resource degradation. Recommendation 4: Expanded collaborative mechanisms and activities should be developed among centres and between centres and their non-CGIAR partners, to help focus research and institutional strengthening on issues related to adoption, adaptation and utilization of research results that so far have remained unused. Implications of a Broader Research Focus The Panel recognized that it is recommending a broadening of the research focus to include non-traditional (for the CGIAR) types of research related to off-farm employment, postharvest technology, niche opportunities, and forestry, agroforestry and fisheries. Such expansion implies a possible readjustment in use of existing resources. On the question of whether there should be an increase in resources, the Panel is fully aware of the constraints. In this era of donor fatigue and contraction of funds for both national and international R&D for agriculture, any expansion may seem unrealistic. The nature of research to target poverty alleviation on MAs dictates the forging of new linkages between the CGIAR and other actors. High transaction costs are inevitable. However, there is an urgent need for an expanded innovative research effort to address poverty alleviation for those who live on MAs. These marginal people have been disregarded in the past. There appears to be a unique opportunity for the CGIAR to contribute towards correcting this neglect. CHAPTER 1 - BACKGROUND This study of research priorities for marginal lands comes as a sequel to the TAC study ‘Priorities and Strategies for Soil and Water Aspects of Natural Resource Management in the CGIAR.“. That report highlighted the importance of “strengthening natural resource management (NRM) [with] explicit linking to . . . the CGIAR contribution to poverty alleviation.” In its review of the TAC report at the Mid-Term Meeting (May 1996), members of the CGIAR concluded that there should be a much greater sense of urgency given to soil and water research due to the centrality of the environmental issue. The focus on poverty alleviation in marginal rural areas does not imply that the System is uninterested in the poor who live on the prime lands or in urban areas. It merely reflects a conviction that the CGIAR has an opportunity not readily available to other suppliers of research, and an obligation to address a rural poverty group which has been left behind In moving ahead to articulate a strategy for achieving the overarching goal of sustainable poverty alleviation and associated food security, the next step specifically with respect to rural poverty is identification of where these people live and their present numbers. From this information base, one may move to characterize the current status of the lands from which they derive part or all of their livelihoods. From the optic of technology to increase productivity of resources used in agriculture, this status may be initially expressed in terms of biophysical potential, i.e. biophysically favoured versus marginal lands. However, the determinants of poverty (marginal people) lie mainly with the socio-economic and institutional aspects (markets, policies, physical infrastructure, human capital) which govern the choice sets of the population in using natural resources to which they have access and in obtaining off-farm income. With specification of the biophysical, institutional, policy and socio- economic characteristics which explain why the various target groups are poor, one is in a position to explore research options whose output and outcomes may be expected to have an impact on sustainable poverty alleviation. From that point one can go on to examine what the CGIAR might do, i.e. the entry points where there is expectation of significant impact from research through output of international public goods. The decision to start the process of assessing possible avenues for change in direction with an examination of research options for marginal lands derive from a perception that marginal populations - the rural poor - are likely to be concentrated in these areas, and further, that the incidence of extreme poverty will be higher than on favoured lands. These areas are seen to be fragile and occupying the major part of lands already settled or in process of expansion (clearing of tropical forest). Accordingly there is a concern with the prospect of large-scale resource degradation and attendant externalities. In addition, there is a presumption that CGIAR research has had little impact on the poor in these areas except by indirection, i.e. by providing employment on favoured lands which have benefited from research, or by lower food prices to those who purchase part of their needs. 2 All land types - marginal or favoured - need research related to environmental protection and sustainable productivity which can to a greater or lesser extent help in the quest for poverty alleviation and expanded food security for the poor. On the favoured lands, expanded production can result in lower prices for urban consumers, as well as to increased jobs and food for the rural poor in both areas. To the extent that the poor live on the marginal lands, research that leads to productivity increases on those lands also can help to alleviate poverty and increase food security. Thus, in and of themselves, the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and environmental protection do not provide useful guidance in terms of allocation of research resource between marginal anId favoured lands. Thus, while “marginal lands” still provide a reference point, the Panel concluded that the study should focus on research issues and strategies related to marginalized people - those whose poverty and food insecurity may be caused by not only their association with biophysically low productivity or impoverished (marginal) lands, but also with, for example, lack of access to inputs, or lack of access to markets (effective dlemand for their production), off-farm means for earning income and related institutional constraints. In its terms of reference (Annex I) TAC made it clear that the System should not be investing in research on marginal lands just because they are currently considered low potential areas for agriculture, and it “favours allocating resources such that the balance between high and low potential environments emerges from the concern with poverty alleviation and resource conservation, rather than being introduced a priori.” 1.1. The Change in Focus Between Phase I and Phase II Phase I of this Study started from the premise that poverty alleviation is the primary gaol of the CGIAR and that the means by which the System would have an impact is through sustainable productivity enhancement embodied within natural resource management. In order to address the issues of research priorities, it was, assumed: marginal lands are a definable research target (areas, population, beneficiaries, and externalities); research requirements are qualitatively different from favoured lands; strategic or tactical questions will be conditioned by trade-offs among poverty alleviation, food production and environmental protection. As a result of exchange of views with TAC, the centres and flier discussion within the Panel, the following modifications have been introduced. The concept of multiple objectives and the inherent trade-offs associated with poverty alleviation, food production and natural resource management is modified. Poverty alleviation is accepted as the single strategic objective. Environmental protection may also be an objective, but not for the CGIAR in situa.tions where there may be trade-offs with poverty alleviation. Rather, productivity enhancement within 3 the context of natural resource management (NRM) or environmental management is seen as the means to poverty alleviation. Further, food security is seen as a question of income. Thus, in the case of rural poverty alleviation on marginal lands, productivity applies to food and non-food activities derived from the renewable resources to which the poor have access, and off-farm income opportunities. It is recognized more explicitly that marginal lands constitute a moving target. There are drawbacks to defining them in terms of biophysical and economic yields since both their physical and economic yields can be altered by on-site investments and exogenous institutional factors affecting markets, prices, resource entitlements, etc. Further, due to spatial variability, farmers may have access to both marginal and favoured lands which could clearly modify their management systems. Thus, soil and climatic domains, although relevant, in most cases are likely to be outweighed by qualifying variables in determining the research approach. The point of departure is marginal poor not marginal lands. The implication is a more explicit focus on the human capital, physical capital and institutional constraints faced by these people, as well as the biophysical constraints of their natural capital. All constraints are considered candidates for research, including integrated approaches to target the rural poor in definable geographic areas. In mapping marginal rural populations for the purpose of defining research options and decision on priorities, criteria for establishing the boundaries will be weighted to the non-biophysical rather than the biophysical determinants of poverty. 1.2. Presentation of the Analysis The terms of reference for the study carry a strong inference that marginal lands (ML) are biophysically defined. The corollary is that with a scientifically solid definition one can map these areas together with existing and forecasted numbers of rural poor in each. From there, the primary point of entry for the CGIAR would be research to overcome the biophysical constraints, in association with socio-economic, policy and institutional research which would facilitate the diffusion and application of technology in on-farm and off-farm activities affecting the welfare of the poor. Given this framework, Chapter 2 deals first with the statistical implications of the biophysical definition of ML; second, with the derivation of marginal agricultural lands (MALs) as a more operational concept enabling plausible estimates of rural poor located on these lands and the resources allocated by the CGIAR to such areas; and third, with the move away from biophysical criteria (as the prime criterion for determining marginality) to a more comprehensive definition of “marginal areas” (MA), based on concentration of marginal rural people and why they are marginal, as the operationally relevant concept for decisions by the CGIAR. Chapter 3 examines the options open to the CGIAR in addressing poverty in MAs. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 assess research requirements bearing on removal of constraints on knowledge, resources and incentives to poverty alleviation in the areas of: change in institutions and policy generation and diffusion of improved technologies diversification of land use and income sources. 4 CHAPTER 2 - DEFINITIONS AND CONTEX:T In responding to the Phase I report of this study, most of the centres8 raised questions on: the interpretation of “marginal lands”; the advisability of using very coarse-g-rained indicators of biophysical capability of land as one basis for programming the System’s activities; the credibility of estimates relating to rural population and land types; and, what is meant by poverty alleviation With respect to its links to research delivered by the CGIAR. 2.1. Marginal Lands Many different names are used to designate lands in terms of their production capacity - favoured, fertile, marginal, low potential, resource poor, high potential, fragile, vulnerable or degraded. Terms which relate to “marginal” areas are frequently used interchangeably and often without definition. The difficulty in formulating a clear definition stems from the fact that “productivity” varies according to the type of land use. A tract of land that is “marginal” for crop production may be well su:ited for grazing. “Fragile” lands may be sensitive to degradation under cultivation but may be sustainably used for forestry. Further more, productivity is not only based on the biophysical characteristics of land, but also depends on the socio-economic paramet,ers of a specific environment. Technologies may be known but the necessary incentives, institutions or inputs may be missing. Farmers are generally aware of the physical. benefits of improved seeds and of mineral fertilizers, but may not have access to inputs or be unwilling to accept the climatic and price risks. The range of possible uses of land is so wide and socio- economic conditions are so diverse that no definition can encompass all the relevant factors. However, in order to ensure a common understanding, the general terms used in this study are briefly described below. Attention is drawn here to the concept of “land” which is broader than just soil or terrain. Although soil is an important and relatively stable element of land it is only one component. Land is an area of the earth’s surface which comprises the major biophysical attributes which influence its use. These include the atmosphere, soil, geology, hydrology, plant and animal populations, and the results of past and present human activity such as terracing, drainage or irrigation. The evaluation of land does not only refer to its productive potential, but also to the sustainability of its use, that is the maintenance or enhancement of its productivity over the long term, while at the same time conserving its potential as a resource base. Table 2.1 lists the four terms - favoured, marginal, fragile and degraded land - which are commonly used in this study. It should be noted that the constraints of a biophysical and socio-economic nature may apply separately or simultaneously. Marginality can be the result of different combinations of constraints. For instance, biophysically “good” land can be marginal on account of its isolation from markets, the unavailability of inputs, or the small size of holdings. The nature, composition and interaction of the factors which determine land marginality differ widely. 5 Table 2.1: Proposed Definitions of Land Types .

The constraints may apply separately or cumulatively. . 2 A distinction needs to be made between reversible and irreversible forms of degradation. Some soils are vulnerable to nutrient depletion, but are sufficiently resilient for soil fertility to be restored through good management. 6 2.2 Initial Framework for Evaluating the Issues The nature and extent of the challenge faced by the CGIAR in addressing poverty alleviation on marginal lands may be illustrated from Table 2.2. Three broad land types are identified: (0 favoured lands with high present agricultural use values (HPUV), (ii) marginal lands with low present agricultural use values (LPUV) and (iii) lands at low or zero intensity of agricultural use (LZI). For each land type one may speculate that there are those with a high potential for expansion of production based on research (HPEPR) and those with a low potential for expansion of production based on research (LPEPR). Thus; there is a six-quadrant matrix which may be addressed by research. It is generally held that research undertaken to date, focused on land types in quadrant I and quadrant II, has largely benefited quadrant II, particularly the wheat and irrigated rice lands. As it stands this table is an approximation of potential to expand agricultural production through research. It does not reflect options for research on forest systems, coastal fisheries related to terrestrial systems or the dynamics of movement of land types among the quadrants (see Annex II). In their response to the Phase I report, most of the centres commented on the criteria used in establishing area estimates for each quadrant, and approximating rural population and rural poor associated with each. In addition, a concept w(as introduced for marginal lands which identified those areas where both the numbers and proportion of rural poor were low, in contrast to what might be considered “poverty dense” areas. In general, the centres do no design their programming to address soil/climatic domains or rural populations classified by geographic area. Rather they tend to target problem areas or specific land use regimes. In spite of the difficulties in defining terms used to characterize the biophysical productivity of lands and in estimating “poverty density”, the Panel considered the six-quadrant approach to be a useful concept in sorting out the issues and priorities in allocating research resources between high productivity areas and marginal lands associated with persistent poverty. It is a particularly appropriate framework in light of the following widely held views which characterize thinking on rural poverty and the role of the CGIAR: ML are defined in biophysical terms which establish them as: having low inherent productivity for agriculture; fragile and therefore susceptible to degradation because of slope and/or climate; and subject to high agricultural r:isk due to climate and disease; ML support a high proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor; the combination of fragility and high density of poor people who place a premium on current consumption (resulting in over-exploitation of natural resources) is leading to accelerated erosion and vegetation destruction; the consequence is a downward poverty spiral with significant negative externalities because of the large areas classified as ML relative to those considered favoured; the impact of CGIAR research on poverty alleviation and related productivity increase and environmental protection in ML has been low. . Table 2.2: Present Use Value (PUV) of Lands and Potential to Expand Production Based on Research (PEPR) :. :. ‘.’ 8 2.3. Marginal Lands as a Moving Target *It is recognized that lands do not neatly define themselves in the above quadrants and that their classification is not definite. In practice, there is a continuum among the quadrants with changes in economic conditions, improvement of infrastructures, innovative research, fluctuations in population pressure. For example, the existence of a continuum is particularly common between quadrant V (forest), quadrant III, and quadrant I. Defining the LZI type is a hazardous exercise where one is moving from the extensive desert margins in quadrant VI to potential opportunities for intensification of forestry in quadrant V. In addition, the definition of lands which are responsive or unresponsive to research (in production terms) is a static concept. In practice, research innovation should enable LPUV lands in quadrants III and IV to be transferred to HPEPR lands in quadrant I and LPEPR lands in quadrant II. Any number of factors may lead to shifts of land from one category to another. These shifts may be upward, through applications of improved techniques, or downward as a result of land degradation or inappropriate development of lands formerly at low use levels. Hence, marginality is not a static concept. When dealing with issues of natural resources management, it is essential that these spatial and temporal dimensions be taken into account. Therefore, “marginality” has to be assessed in terms of specific types of land use. Land that is marginal for a crop requiring a long growing period could be highly productive for more drought tolerant, short-season crops. What is marginal land for cropping may be very suitable for livestock production. The severity of soil constraints may vary with the climatic conditions under which they occur. For instance, under low rainfall, lighter soils may be more productive than heavier soils on account of easier tillage and more rapid uptake of available water. Shifts between quadrants may also result from management practices. Infertile soils which are marginal can become highly productive through judicious application of organic and mineral inputs. A key characteristic of marginal, as distinct from favoured lands is the location specificity of terrain, climate, soils and socio-economic conditions. Many technologies to remedy biophysical marginality are well-known. The dynamic dimension is critical - marked shifts of land quality will result from the use of resources with the necessary incentives to apply results of research, i.e., overcoming the policy and institutional constraints. In summing up, the Panel found that the definition of “marginal” depends on so many qualifiers that it becomes meaningless in an operational sense. This is illustrated by the fact that land can be “marginal” depending on: t its use (what is marginal~agricultural land may be highly productive forest land); t its natural biophysical characteristics (which can be altered by investment); its location relative to infrastructure such as roads, railroads, harbors, and cities (a road into a region can completely alter the economic returns from land near the road); t the institutional and policy context which influences access of inhabitzmts to land, water, credit, markets, outside inputs (development of market access can completely alter the economics of land use): population pressure (e.g., size of land holdings; from a cattle rancher’s perspective, his or her large area of land is not “marginal”, even though the biophysical yield per ha is low; at the same 9 time, a farmer with only one ha. in the midst of the most favoured agricultural area may feel that he or she is on “marginal land”); technology development (Jojoba development in arid environments; acid tolerant rice in the Cerrados of Brazil); b taking advantage of niche opportunities (spices, flowers, vegetables, special fibres) Lands move out of and into marginal status depending on which of the above dimensions are applied in the definition. It only makes sense to define %arginal land” in terms of a clearly defined, specijic situation. 2.4. Contexts in which the Term “Marginal Lands” is Used Because of the wide variety of ways in which “marginal” lands can be defined, the term is used to mean quite different things, depending on the context. In fact, the Panel reached the conclusion that the concept, in a biophysical sense alone, is not adequate to identify operational responses by the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors to poverty alleviation - the fundamental goal of the CGIAR. The Panel identified three common threads that run through the documentation on “marginal lands, ” broadly defined. They are: b A concern with poverty - under the assumption that most of the rural poor live on “marginal” lands; thus a concern for “marginal” lands is a proxy for concern with poverty alleviation for those who happen to live on the myriad forms of less favoured areas of the world; and a further concern for the fact that the CGIAR may somehow have missed these poor people, because it has not targeted poverty in the “marginal” lands areas. (This concern dominates in the development literature) A concern with vulnerable and fragile lands and the problems of irreversible destruction or degradation of sensitive natural areas - the problems of desertification; deterioration of mountain environments; the destruction of other natural environments such as mangroves and natural forests, and pollution and destruction of biodiversity in coastal zones. (This concern dominates in the environmental literature) b A concern that the more favoured rainfed lands, the irrigated lands, and some of the “rice” and “wheat” baskets of the world, as well as highly productive bottomlands and hillsides, were being “marginalized” through overuse or misuse. (This concern shows up in the agricultural development literature, as well as in the environmental literature) The Panel further noted that, even within each of the interpretations of why “marginal lands” are important, there is uncertainty over what the term means, how lands can be classified as “marginal”, and how they can move out of marginal status into productive lands contributing to sustainable development. 10 2.5. From Biophysically Marginal Lands (ML) to Marginal Agricultural Land (MAL) Based on Existing Use In light of the above reasoning, the Panel came to the conclusion that, although the soil/climatic domains specified in Table 2.2 provide a scientifically coherent basis for identifying land capability with respect to its agricultural potential and its expected productivity response to agricultural research, it was not an operationally relevant concept. While retaining the biophysical criterion for classification, it was considered that a better approximation of the marginal land issues faced by the CGIAR would be provided by qualifying biophysical characteristics of lands according to their current use in agriculture (See Table 2.3). This enabled a specification of a scientifically defensible area of favoured agricultural lands (FAL) . Thus, they excluded forest and woodland areas with high agricultural potential. FALs were considered to be in rainfed and irrigated agriculture (800 million ha) in areas which are fertile (with or without chemical subsidies), well-drained, with even topography and (if unirrigated) with adequate rainfall. They are in comparatively intensive use, and generally within their use-capability. They are at risk of degradation if mismanaged but risk of externalities from mismanagement is low, as is vulnerability to irreversible damage. Marginal agricultural lands (MAL) were identified as those areas which are currently used for agriculture, grazing or agroforestry (1.8 billion ha). Such areas typically encompass mountains and tropical and sub-tropical lowlands or plateaux with low, unstable rainfall or higher rainfall areas in intensive use relative to use-capability under existing population densities, traditional technologies and institutional structures. In most cases, in absence of external inputs, they have reached or exceeded the threshold limits to maintenance or enhancement of agricultural performance. They are characterized by: poor soil fertility (nutrient deficiencies, acidity, salinity, poor moisture holding capacity, etc. ) , inaccessibility (poor communications, immobility with all its social and economic implications); fragility (low input absorptive capacity, high input-output ratios, limited capacity to withstand disturbance, vulnerable to irreversible damage); and heterogeneity (physically and culturally diverse with site-specific constraints and opportunities which restrict applicability of general technological or institutional measures to remove constraints or exploit opportunities). Aside from the above inherent characteristics, marginal low-productivity lands may also result from degradation of non-marginal lands or inappropriate development of lands formerly at low or zero use levels. All areas are at risk of further degradation with high expectation of negative externalities. The quadrants V and VI were redefined in Table 2.3 such that quadrant V was considered forested area regardless of its agricultural potential and quadrant ‘VI was classified as arid with very limited rural population regardless of its irrigation potential. Because of the dynamics of movement among quadrants, both of these - particularly quadrant V - are relevant to rural poverty alleviation for the current and future generations in marginal areas. 2.6. Location and Incidence of Rural Poverty on MAL A second modification in the conceptual ML approach centred on the location of rural poverty. Since there are no data for rural population in forest or arid areas, estimates were made for FALs and the residual population was assigned to quadrants III - VI Table 2.3: Extent of Different Land Types in the Developing Regions (million ha and share within region) Land types Favoured Other agricultural land types Quadrant l/II III-VI Region SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 200 2155 40 countries Share (within row) 8.5% 91.5% ASIA 305 1530 20 countries Share 16.6% 83.4% CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA 190 1780 26 countries Share 9.6% 90.4% WEST ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA 100 1185 19 countries Share 7.8% 92.2% TOTAL 795 6650 Total: 105 countries Share 10.7% 89.3% BREAKDOWN OF OTHER LAND TYPES Marginal Forest & Arid agricultural woodland lands III/IV V VI 545 1030 580 23.1% 43.7% 24.6% 550 635 340 30.0% 34.6% 18.5% 400 1220 160 20.3% 61.9% 8. 1% 290 50 845 22.6% 3.9% 65.8% 1785 2935 1925 24.0% 39.4% 25.9% Irrigation in arid lands (l/II) 3 0.1% 28 1.5% 4 0.2% 12 0.9% 46 0.6% TOTAL 2355 100% 1835 100% 1970 100% 1285 100% 7445 100% Table 2.4: Rural Population and Rural Poor on Different Land Types (in million) “.‘.‘.” ” ,.I ‘. ” .,.,. :: ‘.’ .,., .,:.,:::. _‘. :. .,.I ‘. .:.:. : ” :. :. ::. :. : ,.I .,.I. .,.,. :. .,., .,. ., ,. 1. .:.:.:.: .,.,.,.,. : ‘,’ ” ‘.’ ::. :. :::: :. “.’ :._ .QuacirFW,:;:,:,:, ::.:: :. :;::. :. ::. ” :eglan:::.:.::. .‘.‘.‘.‘.‘.‘.‘.‘. : I, . 1;. ;:,_. ;, :.,:l.:;l.::::l 1:: ,::;,.:, .:. : .” : ‘.‘.::, RM~:?OOR:‘. :,:,:;AVE&m : .; : ‘:::‘,Of.&$r, ‘. ;.:. :j,:;, &&!g:: :.j: .‘,&?@$j&~.

The distribution is 35 % (930 million on FALs) and 65 % (1,760 million) on other lands (MAL, forest and arid lands). The question then arises as to whether there is a greater incidence of rural poverty on MALs than FALs. National figures available for rural poor, as a percent of total rural population, were compared with the percent of rural population on MALs to assess whether countries with a high proportion of population on MAL also showed high incidence of rural poverty. No correlation was found. This conclusion also is suggested by the work of Kelley and Rao in India3. An IFPRI study, also in India, suggests that both the absolute numbers and incidence of rural poverty are greater on FAL than MAL4. Accordingly, rural poverty in the two areas was approximated by applying national percentages - the result 325 million poor on FAL and 630 million on MAL’. Similarly, in forecasting poverty on MAL, the only proxy for future numbers in the latter area would have to be derived from projections of overall rural poverty. Using trend estimates for the 1990-2000 period, one might speculate that, unless a major effort is made, numbers are unlikely to decline significantly at a global level in the near future. However, at the regional level, in sub-Saharan Africa the situation is likely to deteriorate such that its share of the world’s rural poor may increase from about 30% to 45% by early next century. Asia would continue to have the highest absolute number of rural poor, but its world share may drop from around 60% to 50%6. Introduction of the degradation and productivity dimensions to the poverty- marginal land linkages requires a focus on the dynamics of movement, from favoured agricultural lands downward to ML and the reverse through upgrading. It also requires considering the possibilities for: expanding the stock of favoured agricultural lands by transformation from the 2.9 billion ha of forests and development of irrigation on a small fraction of the 2 billion ha in arid land; or, expanding the stock of marginal lands, assumed to be driven largely by rural poverty, at the expense of forest lands. These dimensions are discussed below with respect to rural poverty alleviation (in MALs) linked to FALs. 2.7. Linkage of FAL to Poverty on MAL There are three reasons for considering favoured agricultural lands (FALs) in a study of poverty alleviation on marginal lands: Through degradation they can shift into the low productivity category (marginal) of either rainfed or irrigated lands. As pointed out in comments by several of the 6 Kelley, T.C. and P.P. Rao. 1995. “Marginal Environments and the Poor: Evidence from India”. Economic and Political Weekly. Vol. xxx. No.40. Fan, S. and P.B.R. Hazell. 1996. “Should the India Government Invest More in Less Favoured Areas? “. IFPRI, Washington D.C. This figure contrasts with an estimate made in the mid 1980s - 370,000 poorest of the poor (using the criterion of the poorest 20% for each country) on low potential lands, in: Leonard, H.H. (ed.). 1989. “Environment and the Poor: Development Strategies for a Common Agenda “. Transaction Books. Oxford. Pin&up-Andersen, P. and R.

Washington, D.C. 14 centres on the Phase I report of the study, the clearest example is salinization of irrigated lands. The impact of this process is increasing poverty on an increasing stock of marginal lands. Through further productivity increase, particularly in quadrant I, they should provide employment opportunities for rural poor who would otherwise contribute to pressure (degradation) on MALs or to accelerated conversion of forest to MALS. Similarly, the processes of reduction of pressure on natural resoiurces as a means to poverty alleviation would also apply to employment opportunities generated in value-added or off-farm activities in FALs. In addition to the role of favoured lands in poverty alleviation ,for present and future rural populations in marginal areas, there is also the question of research directed to the poor on favoured lands themselves. This is a fundamental strategic question for the CGIAR in terms of the balance among research investments which address a range of rural population target groups from a poverty alleviation perspective. There is also a major question of yield maintenance research in FALs. There is a continuum from investments designed to: rehabilitate the productive capacity of the resource, i.e. reverse the degradation process; conserve the “state” of resources, and implicitly their yield capacity; and enhance yields. The first two are land improving investments, the third is “technological change”7. It is evident that priority of research related to poverty alleviation in all areas (favoured and marginal) through’ changes in the cultivated area, employment and income generated on FALs by reducing shifts to lower productivity, investment in productivity increase, human capital, physical infrastructure and institutional change, ishould be judged by the cost-effectiveness of research expected to have poverty alleviation impacts for the various target groups. The Panel is aware that we are a long way from specification of these target groups. Nevertheless, the linkages and dynamics of movement among classes of land and changes in the numbers and location of the rural poor, dictate that any’ strategy of rural poverty alleviation on marginal lands take into account the social cost-effectiveness of research on favoured lands, and should incorporate the spillovers to other areas. The framework for cost-effectiveness. analysis is discussed in Annex III. Wit8 _ ” The dilemma of research on MALs vis-a-vis FALs has been characterised by de well endowed regions are able to meet demands at relatively low prices . . . this marginalizes less endowed regions because their terms of trade are eroding. Scarcity of funds, and the lack of political power of (these) regions makes it unlikely that the transfer of money that would be needed to revert such marginalization processes will occur in the foreseeable future. . . . Agricultural research which is oriented to improvement of least endowed regions may open up new possibilities in some situations. However, in many cases its results are more readily applied in regions that are better off.“’ Accepting this premise, a ‘key issue for the CGIAR is the weighting of poverty in the formula discussed in Annex III. . 7 8 Scherr, S.J. and S.Yadav. 1996. “Land Degradation in the Developing World: Implications for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment to 2020”.

Current CGIAR Activity in Poverty Alleviation on MAL Based on the foregoing definitions of MAL and FAL, the CGIAR invests about one-third of its resources in the favourable agricultural lands of quadrants I and II (FALs), and the remaining two-thirds on the marginal agricultural lands of quadrants III and IV (see Annex IV). Considering, however, that targeted MALs include productive areas such as the cracking “black cotton” soils of India and western Africa, the poorly drained “inland valleys” of West Africa and the infertile “Cerrados” of Brazil, it would also seem appropriate to draw the conclusion that three quarters of CGIAR resources are being applied to increase the sustainable productivity of lands with high agro-ecological potential. In terms of the three primary thrusts of research (see section 3.4), estimates of resource allocation indicate that around 30% support activities aimed at generating improved biological opportunities, close to 50% go to the intensification and diversification of production systems, and the remaining 20% to policies and institutional issues. Current activity categories, however, are not sensitive enough to indicate actual resources allocated to alleviating constraints for the marginal poor. An assessment of objectives, outputs and beneficiaries of the 374 projects endorsed for 1997 showed that 25% are fully targeted at poverty alleviation on MALs and 7% in FALs (Annex IV). 2.9. From Marginal Lands to Marginal Population In reviewing the figures presented in Sections 2.6 and 2.8 derived from a biophysical definition of MAL and FAL, the Panel came to the conclusion that the inconsistencies and lack of data on the underlying site-specific forces driving the rural poverty process were such as to invalidate their usefulness in guiding CGIAR strategy towards poverty alleviation on marginal lands. On the surface, the existence of two-thirds of the rural poor on MAL would fully justify the CGIAR’s concern with poverty on these lands. This is further reinforced if one accepts an underlying hypothesis of the Lucerne Declaration, that Green Revolution techniques have had limited impact on productivity for poverty alleviation in MALs, so defined. However, on further reflection the Panel concluded there was no evidence to support this hypothesis. There are areas where CGIAR research has not contributed to rural poverty alleviation but they are not confined to MAL. In addition, there are MALs which have shown significant response to research by the System in terms of productivity and, by inference, poverty alleviation. MAL is simply not a good proxy for where the poor people live or where the CGIAR has had little impact. Under these circumstances it was decided to discard biophysical productivity of lands, whether in the pure sense of world soils and climate, i.e. ML, or in the restricted sense of those areas currently in agricultural use, i.e. MAL, as the point of entry for assessing CGIAR strategy with respect to rural poverty alleviation. 16 The Panel had considerable difficulty in finding a substitute term for ML or MAL which respected an interpretation of the intent of the terms of reference to be that the study address strategic issues in research aimed at poverty alleviation on lands which were intuitively considered as biophysically marginal and which clearly were believed to support high concentrations of rural poor who had not benefited from Green Revolution research e.g. the Himalaya, Andes, desert margins of WANA or tropical forest margins. In fact, the Panel believes that the above interpretation of the intent has been respected. For want of anything better the term adopted as the ‘unit” for evaluation of strategy was “marginal area” (MA), i.e. one with a high incidence of rural poor subject to a relatively homogeneous set of conditions which determine why they are poor (see section 2.10). This obviously includes biophysical conditions. In spite of the fact that MA may be applied to any combination of biophysically marginal or favoured land, the Panel elected to use this term in Chapters 3 to 6 in examining options open to the CGIAR to address rural poverty through change in: policies and institutions; new and improved technologies and diversification of land use and income sources in MAs. 2.10. Poverty Processes on Marginal Areas The Panel considered the forces driving the processes which retain people in poverty on MAs, in terms of the inter-relationships between the resources and knowledge available to these people and their incentive to use them for sustainable enhancement of livelihoods. This relates to the question of constraints to access of the poor to knowledge, natural resources, markets and off-farm income opportunities (including the options to migrate). Constraints are generally regarded as rooted in institutions and policies. Marginal areas, because of characteristics such as their isolation, perceived low and risky productive potential, and the insignificant economic and associated political power of their inhabitants, typically have been neglected by central governments. As a result, only limited public investment has been made in education, health, infrastructure, etc. Little interest has been shown in determining the aspirations of marginal people or their knowledge of how to cope with harsh environments as a basis for focusing public action responsive to their capabilities and needs. In view of the high costs of providing quality services to such areas, it has been argued that accelerated development im other sectors - non-marginal rural areas, industry, services - would be sufficient to attract migration on a scale which would increase the resource base (and income) per capita for the residual population. The “trickle down” theory of development and poverty alleviation in most marginal areas has not worked. Populations in many are increasing in albsolute numbers in spite of migration, and increase is likely to continue, probably at a decreasing rate, for some decades. Without investment in the “resource base” of these people, with expanding populations the expectation can only be progressive extension of poverty and degradation of the soils and forests on which they depend for a large part of their sustenance. 17 . In agriculture, inappropriate research has been blamed for not taking into account indigenous luiowledge and the opportunities and constraints which apply to the site-specific characteristics of MAs. Thus, it is asserted that few research results have led to widespread or significant improvement in the welfare of marginal people. This is undoubtedly true in many instances but is merely one symptom of the underlying cause of marginality, i.e. the institutional and policy arrangements. Without any negotiating leverage by marginal communities on the decision.makers responsible for the amount and type of investment in MAs, these investments tend to be small and poorly adapted to the requirements of the people. This applies equally to agricultural research and extension investments (and other areas such as education, health or infrastructure) which have been unable to respond to complex diverse requirements for sustainable exploitation of opportunities deriving from natural resources and value adding micro-enterprises. However, the problem is not technology as such. Rather, it is the institutional arrangements which determine: what and how agricultural research and extension is carried out, together with the whole range of support services (credit, roads, communications, schools, etc.); resource entitlements; the functioning of markets; and local capacity to manage their own affairs’. A matter of concern is the breakdown of common property systems in some areas where they comprise an important part of the risk-sharing and survival strategies of poor farmers and herders on lands with highly variable rainfall (see Box 1). It is evident that the institutions and policies which drive the poverty process are country-specific. Nevertheless, the CGIAR appears to have a role to play, albeit small, in helping to introduce poverty alleviation strategies for the poor living in MAs. Among the principal avenues open to the CGIAR are those already outlined in the TAC report on policy and management research lo. 2.11. Implications: Recommendations for the CGIAR The Panel is fully aware that by discarding the biophysical criteria for defining ML or MAL, it is violating the spirit of the terms of reference. By redefining the issues in terms of MAs which may occur on any combination of FAL and MAL, the issue of poverty alleviation is being placed in a global context, rather than being confmed to marginal lands and the rural poor who derive a large part of their livelihoods from them, and who a priori are believed to have been by-passed by the Green Revolution. Nevertheless, it is sustained ‘that this is merely another way of cutting the pie. The key question is still where are the concentrations of poor who have been by-passed by CGIAR research. The criterion for distinguishing the by-passed from the non-by-passed 9 10 Jodha,’ N.S. 1995. ‘Enhancing Food Security in a Warmer and More Crowded World: Factors and Process in Fragile Areas’.

Rome. 18 rural poor is different. It carries the implications that conditions for maqginality of people also exist on FALs as is implied in Table 2.1, e.g. landless and land poor (farm size issues). 19 Box 1: Common Property Resources and Marginal Lands Rural common property resources (CPR) described simply are community resources where every member of the community has access and reciprocal obligation to help in their regulated use, without any exclusive private right to claim and saIe any part of the resources. In the developing countries they include community grazing lands, forests, watering ‘points, watersheds and (in a de facto sense) most of the public lands not assigned by the state for private use or public reserves. Much of these latter areas may be considered de facto “open access”, i.e., there is no management by a community, individual or the state. CPRs play an important roIe in: consumption by the rural poor as a source of supplies (e.g., fuel, fodder and food); incomes through collection as well as processing and sale of wild products - especially during the seasons and years when crop incomes are not available; and enhancing nutrient availability to draft animals needed for crop farming. In some areas rural poor derive as much as 30 percent of their consumption from CPRs. Moreover, in villages with productive CPRs, they providezrop income as well. Thus, CPR-PPR (private property resource) based activities have significant complementarity. However, in most countries due to institutional, policy and demographic changes, CPRs are under severe stress. Area has declined due to legal or illegal privatisation and with weakening of the culture of group action productivity has deteriorated. ln practice, CPRs have become open access. This’ suggests research aimed at rehabilitation of CPRs with two inter-related components: (i) technology oriented measures (in terms of germplasm, agronomic practices ‘adapted to communal management) and (ii) institutional arrangements (which could help in promoting group action and better regulated use, including lands currently in open access exploitation. Research focused on enhancing the range of options for the poor in MAs should include the. CPRs. .’ Similarly, local level initiatives through participatory research could address the institutional dimension of CPR rehabilitation and management. The above possibilities can be incorporated into the Systemw’ide initiative on property rights and collective action coordinated by IFPRI. As a part of this initiative, the question of selective privatisation of CPRs can also be examined. Especially in the African context, there is a push for land-titling supported by the donors. The justification is to ensure proper incentives for land users and create collateral for credit for the farmers’using common lapds. The CPRs - due to their wider spread in terms of access and . spatial location, offer multiple options to the poor to cope with risk. By . promoting individual land entitlements, the policy may tend to restrict the range of options and access to resources and opportunities available to the poor. There is room for researdh to examine the trade-offs. . 20 .One way to reduce the scope of a “marginal lands” study in the initial stages would be to exclude any consideration of MAs on the 800 million ha classified as FAL. One might justify this on the grounds that these are the areas which most clearly have benefited from the Green Revolution - if there is residual poverty on this area, this could be addressed as part of a global rural poverty study. However, the conclusion was that, because of: - heterogeneity of ML and FL (or MAL and FAL) in landscapes, - the likely overriding importance of institutions in defming MAs, - the linkages between MAs and non-MAs in poverty alleviation within h4As, - the critical importance of income in poverty alleviation which dictates a research focus on: food and non-food products (and associated value added); opportunities and constraints to off-farm sources of earnings and productivity from forest areas, coastal zones and savanna woodlands (not incorporated in the definitions of FAL and MAL), and - the likelihood that definition of MAs on non-favoured areas will probably spill over into definition of MAs on FALs, again because of country or region- specific institutions driving the poverty process, it would be more efficient to specify MA without regard to an arbitrary distinction between biophysically favoured and marginal lands. Given the existing mix of work in the centres (see Chapters 3-6) it is not clear the extent to which this explicit focus on poverty alleviation would imply changes in the actual research project work done by the centres. With the above in mind, the Panel puts forth the following first recommendation: Recommendation 1: The CGIAR needs to sharpen its strategic focus on poverty alleviation particularly in setting priorities for research related to marginal rural areas. A prerequisite is development of a geo-referenced d.atabase linking biophysical land conditions with poverty and with the processes that produce it (i.e., the dynamics of poverty). In order to meet this chillenge, the System, and individual centres within it, will need to develop a database relevant, to the design and assessment of options t.hat lead to more effective impacts on income of the rural poor in highly diverse marginal areas. Elements of this database will be the soil, climatic and terrain conditions. However, as the centres have pointed out in their comments on the Phase I report, there are many other elements which are equally or more important - production systems, human capital, market access and infiastructuye, institutional and policy constraints and the number and location of the rural poor with respect to any or all of the above characteristics. A logical place to start this activity would appear to be the centres’ expertise on the geographic iareas with which they deal; perhaps initially by developing an intuitive Geographical Information System (GIS) which can be progressively improved by formal or informal metholds. The issue of site specificity, diversity and complexity must be addressed to identify points of entry which 21 are relevant and consistent with the CGIAR’s scale. The question here is the extent to which centres may move towards targeting site-specific (or through a typology, situation- specific) rural poverty through research which meets the “international public goods” criterion. Meeting this recommendation is regarded as a prerequisite to action on the three recommendations put forward in Chapter 3. The Panel is convinced that the centres’ scientific expertise, coupled with their field experience in most, if not all, of the diverse MAs, represent a unique resource in coming to grips with the information/analytical challenge. Thus the work should be undertaken in a coordinated fashion by the centres themselves. IFPRI and ISNAR could take leading roles in providing support to the activity. An opportunity exists to initiate this process in the up-coming MTP exercise. 22 CHAPTER 3 - POVERTY ALLEVIATION ON MARGINAL AREAS: THE ROLE OF THE CGIAR IN REMOVING CONSTRAINTS The previous chapter made it clear that the nature and causes of the poverty found on marginal areas vary widely with the type of conditions which determine marginality of the rural population. Thus, there are significant differences between the poor farmer on the mountainous hillsides of the Andes or the Himalayas, the farmer surviving on the fringes of the Amazon forest or in the Zaire Basin, and the farmer on the drylands of the African savanna woodlands. The solutions to alleviate poverty for the inhabitants of these diverse lands are as varied as the situations encountered. However, there are some common .th.reads - some common requirements and opportunities - that relate to most of the diverse rural poverty situations encountered. These involve the actions that are necessary to deal with the resource, knowledge, and incentive constraints that are the fundamental barriers to poverty alleviation. Thus, the Panel has identified three types of requirements that all situations have in common: l Reforming policies and institutions. This involves improving the social, institutional, and physical infrastructure (access to markets and. market information; price policies; access to credit and essential purchased inputs; establishment and strengthening of markets; improved property rights; improved roads, communications, transportation, and so forth); a Generating and diffusing new and improved technologies. This applies to crop, livestock, forestry, agroforestry, and fisheries. The new technologies need to fit the various biophysical and institutional characteristics and constraints of the diverse agricultural and associated lands; l Diversifying land use systems and income opportunities. This includes increasing access to off-farm employment (e.g., through forestry, fisheries, and agro-industrial opportunities associated with improved postharvest technologies, small-scale enterprise development, etc.). Figure 3.1 provides an overview of how these three categories of requirements/opportunities link to poverty alleviation for those who live in MAs. We emphasize the point that it generally takes integrated action in all three areas to break the ‘vicious circle’ of poverty and to move a marginal population along the development path. Because these three basic requirements are common in principle and concept (although not in operational detail) for nearly all marginal land-poverty types, they provide promising areas in which to search for the international public goods research opportunities, which are the focus of the CGIAR. Thus, we look at them in more detail in the following chapters, after elaborating the Panel’s understanding of what the CGIAR focus should be in this area. 23 Figure 3.

The International Role of the CGIAR In considering the CGIAR’s role in poverty alleviation for the poor residing in the marginal areas of the world, the Panel took into account two basic facts: 1) the CGIAR accounts for only a small proportion of global agricultural, forestry and fisheries research; thus, the most that the CGIAR can hope for is to become an advocate and a catalyst, albeit a key one, for positive action; 2) the CGIAR’s particular advantage - and its mandated role - is to provide international public goods that can contribute to sustainable poverty alleviation. The Panel’s interpretation of the role of the CGIAR System is baseld on TAC conclusions, confirmed by the CGIAR members. Thus, international research initiatives undertaken within the System should (TAC Soil and Water Study): Produce research results of an international public goods nature; they should provide benefits (either directly or through externalities) across national borders. Globalize (or standardize) methodologies used in local studies to ensure comparability of results across ecoregions, and for use in researching common themes or problems within ecosystems; this should include methodologies that integrate biophysical and socioeconomic research. . Involve locally relevant and responsive research within ecoregions (or watersheds), but with a global perspective to (1) take advantage of economies of scale in research, (2) maximize use of spillovers from research, (3) reduce transactions costs in doing research, and (4) allow efficient movement up the learning curve. Be multisectoral and multidisciplinary in nature and scope, recognizing the different sectors and disciplines dealt with across the CGIAR System. (Thus, for example, the CGIAR Systemwide SWNM Programme, or the proposed Water Programme should be explicitly linked to ecoregional activities, to germplasm improvement and commodity research activities of selected Centres, and to various policy related research issues pursued by such Centres as IFPRI, e.g., in the area of water policy and common property resource management). Take advantage of complementary activities of different suppliers of research, both within and outside the CGIAR System and contribute to the work of others, both NARS and advanced institutions. Keeping these priorities and criteria for CGIAR involvement in mind at all times, the Panel then considered the CGIAR current activity, role, and options for the future in each of the three areas described above. 3.2. Gender Considerations The Panel recognized a general point that applies to most MA poverty situations - the importance of women and the importance that needs to be given to gender issues. According to FAO’s latest statistics”, women’s contribution to agriculturatl production in Sub-Saharan Africa is some 60-80 percent of the total (compared with 50 percent in Asia and 40 percent in Latin America). Further, indicative figures for developing 11 FAO 1996. ‘Women Feed the World’. FAO Fact Sheet, World Food Summit, 13- 17 November 1996, FAO, Rome. 25 countries show, according to FAO, that no more than 5 percent of extension resources are received by women; yet in many areas more than 50 percent of household’s are headed by women. Women’s “invisibility” is further accentuated by their lack of political power and social representation. They are less educated and, thus, their contribution toward food security often is less than it could be. FAO concludes in its briefing paper to the World Food Summit that: Since the 197Os, the number of women living below the poverty line has increased by 50 percent, in comparison with 30 percent for their male counterparts. More than 70 percent of the 1,300 million poor people today are women. And many of these poor women live in MAs of the world and thus are of prime interest to the present study. The Panel did not feel that it should single out the gender issue in a separate chapter or section, but rather treat the issue as an all pervasive one that applies throughout the discussion that follows; and should be a central consideration, regardless of the path taken towards poverty alleviation in MAs. 3.3 Scope for Research-Based Solutions td Rural Poverty Rural poverty, particularly that associated with marginal areas, is a product of multiple factors, some of which fall outside the scope of research generated by the CGIAR and others. Nevertheless, the System does have a significant opportunity to bring to bear scientific objective analysis which could have an important catalytic impact on NARS, NGOs, the private sector and resource user communities. ’ Table 3.1 characterises some of the most critical gaps between the requirements for research and development (R&D) for MAs and the features of ongoing research efforts. Frequent reference has been made to the lack of information on MAs and the way their inhabitants gain a livelihood. This is no accident. Those responsible for decisions to collect information have considered it as either unnecessary, too costly, or a low pay-off investment. The approach requires targeting the MAs, the population groups living on these areas and the rural poverty sub-sector within the population. For any area or group, information required would include biophysical and social diversity, resource use patterns, survival strategies, sources of income and employment, migration and the dynamics of change. Focus of research based on this information should be aimed at increasing the range and quality of options open to the poor for: deriving income from the resources available to them; operating more effectively in the market for goods and services. This option-centred approach would be based on analysis of constraints and opportunities’2 to systematically accumulate information on options and the types of MA poverty situations in which they may be applied. The challenge to the CGIAR is the generation of viable partnerships and formulation of a research framework to guide 12 FAO, 1995. ‘Special Programme on Food Production in Support of Food Security in LIFDCS: Advisory Note on Participatory Analysis of Constraints and Opportunities ‘. 26 the work of NARS, NGOs, etc. in assembling diagnoses and innovative field experience which will be cumulative and enriched by comparative analyses. 3.4. The Way Ahead for the CGIAR - a Summary The road to poverty alleviation for the poor living on MAs is a rocky and twisting one. Negotiating it will require concerted effort by many parties, hopefully working in concert and in a coordinated and effective way together. The role of CGIAR will be a minor, but crucial one. There is not much that the CGIAR can do, but ‘what it can do is essential to the process. Basically, the Panel sees the CGIAR as being able to move further i.n three main directions: (1) (2) (3) It can provide support to policy and institutional reforms, through its work on identification of poverty processes and constraints to its alleviation; work in the area of identifying, locating, and classifying the areas and types of poverty for which it is best equipped to address; and work in the area of policy and institution strengthening. Many of the critical needs in the latter area already have been explored by the panel producing TAC’s recent strategic studies on policy research and institution strengthening research and service needs. It can continue with its mainstream work with commodity improvement in agriculture, forestry, agroforestry, and fisheries, but with added emphasis on . breeding and agronomic work related to the needs of the MA conditions, e.g., need for drought tolerant varieties,’ work on integrated soil nutrient and water balances and utilization, work on IPM and other more environment friendly approaches to agricultural intensification and improvement. The CGIAR can continue on the path of increased support to natural resources management research, and research related to land use diversification and land use systems approaches to the problems of MAs. This trend was started some eight years ago, when the CGIAR diversified and expanded its mandate to take on forestry, agroforestry , and fisheries. More recently, the System has endorsed TAC’s recommendations and centre initiatives with regard to greater focus on Integrated Natural Resources Management, soil and water research, integrated pest management, ecoregional approaches to research, expansion of work on postharvest technologies, and various policy and institution strengthening activities that contribute to more diversified land use and farming systems approaches. 27 Table 3.1: Imperatives for Poverty-Oriented R&D and Dominant Characteristics of Current Research for MAs 1.

D. Imperatives of biophysical conditions related to social processes: Strong agro- ecosystem social system linkages to shape choice and design of production options and practices as a part of diversified farming system; Institutional arrangements for resource-use regulation. Despite good work on farming systems, research has been persistently top-down disregarding indigenous systems and participatory approaches, resulting partly from subsidiary role of social sciences; inadequate attention to institutional aspects.

Vol. 26 (13). 28 The CGIAR System has been moving towards expansion of activities that relate directly or indirectly to the poverty issues encountered in the MAs. The I?anel now is suggesting that this focus be strengthened and that some of the System’s work be directly targeted to poverty alleviation for those living in MAs - always keeping in. mind, of course, that the System should only be addressing those issues which have: international dimensions and for which the international public goods constraint holds, and for which the System and its centres have a clear advantage vis-a-vis the many other actors involved. It is clear to the Panel that a focus on poverty alleviation brings witlh it a number of challenges related to the identification, development and organization of research. Chief among these is that because of the heterogeneity and site-specificity of MAs and their internal diversity and complexity, there is a need to develop new forms of partnerships with NARS, NGOs, developed country institutions, and multi and bilateral agencies. Poverty alleviation as an over-arching objective implies a set of actors and a set of actions that go far beyond the areas in which the CGIAR has strengths. The Panel stresses this point and its fii conclusion that the CGIAR should not spread its efforts too thin. The three broad areas of activity discussed above are ones in which the CGIAR legitimately could become - or is - involved. However, its role will be narrow and small, albeit important. The key to success is establishment of the right kinds of partnerships. Its focus on systematic accumulation and dissemination of information and on methodology for addressing complex site-specific rural poverty situations should provide the necessary legitimacy to attract other actors. Thus, the Panel recommends that: Recommendation 2: The centres should establish new forms of partnership iu order to effectively address their roles in a broader poverty alleviation strategy related to those who live in marginal rural areas. The Panel believes that the poverty alleviation focus can help provide impetus for development of innovative and effective approaches to partnership with NARS, NGOs and various other groups. Such partnerships will depend on fmding complementary sources of funding for all partners involved. It will also imply development of incentives for long term collaboration and cooperation, since poverty alleviation is an evolutionary process. These activities will be facilitated once the eco-regional approach becomes operational. Two additional points regarding the way ahead need to be stressed here: Need to understand land and water degradation processes. As discussed in the TAC Soil and Water study, there is need to improve our understanding of land and water degradation processes. This is relevant to the purpose of the present study. There appears to be little hard evidence linking the poor, in contrast to the non-poor, to accelerated resource degradation. Degradation processes need to be understood and then linked to the poverty processes. In the case of MAs, reversal of their degradation processes will require resource-centred technologies beyond the crop-centred focus which has characterised much agricultural research to date. 29 Need to understand why research results on the shelf are not used for yield enhancement. Whether one is considering policy/institutions research, technology and systems research, or research on diversification options, there are many good results on the shelves of research centres which have never been used. As also suggested in the TAC Soil and Water study, the CGIAR System needs to understand better why good technologies are not put to use. There is considerable pressure to expand research designed to reduce the rate of resource degradation which has led to encroachment on forests, salinization, loss of wetland and erosion. Results are manifested in severe shortages of fnelwood, the drying up of springs and streams, loss of valuable and relatively unique sources of genetic diversity. For example, some of the richest areas of biodiversity in the East and Central African highlands are under threat of disappearing due to changes in land use management. The Panel debated developing new and separate recommendations regarding both degradation and productivity, and decided that it could make the points better by reaffirming the recommendations as they came out of the TAC Soil and Water study, but with the added emphasis on linking the resulting information with poverty processes related to marginal areas. Better information is needed on the degradation processes, couched in the context of issues related to fragility and resilience, and to consideration of issues related to pollution, biodiversity loss and loss of other environmental services. Thus, the Panel puts forth the following two recommendations: Recommendation 3: The CGIAR System should develop improved mechanisms by which centres can be involved with other partners in generating and interpreting improved scientific evidence on: (i) the extent and magnitude of the impacts of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on the degradation or enhancement of natural resources and the consequences for production and food security; and (ii) the linkage between poverty and observed resource degradation. Recommendation 4: Expanded collaborative mechanisms and activities should be developed among the centres, and between centres and their non-CGIAR partners, to help focus research and institutional strengthening on issues related to adoption, adaption, and utilisation of research results that so far have remained unused. The Panel is concerned that its recommendations related to expanded research, particularly on technologies, should be realistic and should take into account the problems in dissemination and adoption of such research. In a poverty alleviation context, the poor would not benefit from more and more research if the results merely sit on the shelves of the scientists and their agencies. This recommendation links closely to the discussion in Chapter 4 related to developing a better understanding of the aspirations and incentives of the poor from MAs. 30 CHAPTER 4 - REFORMING POLICIES AND INSTTWTIONS: ROLE OF THE CGIAR No matter how good the quality of land, poverty cannot be addressed effectively if a perverse set of policies keeps people from meeting their potentials and eiffectively keeps them from taking advantage of opportunities to better themselves economically. The poor in MAs in most cases are not poor only because of the biophysical quality of their land resources. In fact, in many MAs, there are large pockets of land that are of quite good quality for agricultural production; but institutional or policy barriers keep the poor farmers poor. The conceptual and analytical framework developed in Chapter 4 indicated that reform of policies and institutions is one of the three major areas of need that cuts across nearly all poverty situations for those living on the MAs of the world. In the present chapter we address this area of concern in terms of a) what it involves; b) what the CGIAR currently is doing to deal with it; and c) what the Panel sees as the options for the future for intensification of CGIAR effort in this area. It is clear that research is needed to identify the specific types of poverty situations, and the poverty processes encountered in different geographical areas. Once such information is in hand, then research is needed on the policy options .that lbest can remove the barriers that exist in specific poverty situations. This type of information is also essential for design of other research targeted to poverty alleviation where policy or institutional constraints are expected to persist. 4.1. Nature of the Issues Involved The Panel considers that there are three basic categories of barriers to poverty alleviation in MAs: those related to availability of knowledge (people knowing what is right and possible to do, and how to do it); those related to availability of resources (people having the ability to take action, purchase necessary inputs, and so forth); and those related to existence of incentives to take action toward poverty alleviation (people having the motivation to do it). To deal with these constraints, governments have three basic types of policy instruments: regulatory mechanisms; fiscal and jinancial mechanisms; and institutional mechanisms. An effective policy and institutional reform program must deal with all three of these in the context of all the barriers encountered. A holistic approach is essential, since all the pieces have to fit together. 31 4.2. Current Activity and Future Options for the CGIAR Examples of targeted activities here are IFPRI’s research projects on: (i) sustainable development of fragile rainfed lands; and (ii) policy, technology and institutional options for arresting deforestation and resource degradation in the forest margins of the humid tropics. The first project expects to generate knowledge about fragile land management for a wide group of users including policymakers, aid agencies, development agencies, NGOs, researchers, farmers in Central American hillsides, East African highlands, Southeast Asian hillsides, West African Sahel and dryland India working on natural resources management and in promoting sustainable land management. The second project expects to produce a set of policy, technological and institutional insights of broad applicability to the problem of managing growth and resource use in the humid forest regions of developing countries. Those likely to use the knowledge include researchers and administrators in NARS and policymakers at all levels in developing countries and policymakers in aid and lending agencies. The ultimate beneficiaries of this research are small farmers and the communities they comprise, as well as larger farming operations and populations engaged in extractive activities. As explored in Chapter 2, in many MA poverty situations, the key bottlenecks are related to weak institutions and perverse or ineffective policies. While the CGIAR System is addressing some of these issues, they need to be emphasized more, particularly in a poverty alleviation context. However, a fundamental problem is lack of adequate data on the location, nature, extent, and causes of rural poverty in the MAL regions of the world. Thus, the Panel sees as a first priority the development of a useful data base that will help centres (and their partners in this poverty alleviation work) identify target populations and issues, assess which comparative situations should be addressed by CGIAR work, and design approaches to the research likely will be most productive. An example of CGIAR involvement in assembling baseline data and background diagnostic studies of institutional and policy issues in a broader problem-solving context is the Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn (ASB) programme. It is an example of how the System fits within the overall picture, focusing on the international public goods aspects (through the comparative studies of sites and through work with NARS that involves spillovers). It is also an example of how poverty alleviation, community stabilization, and environmental protection objectives can be’brought together in an integrated fashion. Other Systemwide initiatives also have similar objectives for international comparative analysis of specific site studies, in some cases using the ecoregional approach, which the System presently is struggling to define and operationalize (cf. the ongoing Centre Directors’ study to operationalize the approach). The Panel believes that the added emphasis and focus on poverty alleviation as a direct target for research may help to add further focus, clarification, and logic to the ecoregional approach to institutional and policy research - an internationally productive 32 and valid activity for CGIAR involvement, expected to lead to locally relevant results useful, both in terms of development of research processes and in terms of substance. CGIAR research should be focused on understanding the processes by which poverty can be alleviated, particularly in the context of what is possible folr the MAs on which the poor live. It should compare across countries the dynamics of MAs as they move in and out of that category; it should be comparing the potential contributions of crops, livestock, fisheries, forests and trees, of policy changes, of option for value added and off-farm employment, and of technology advancements under different country and regional conditions; and it should draw process oriented conclusions from such comparative research. Centres within the System should be working on improvements in the information base on poverty; they should be working on the means for improving constraint analysis on poverty, i.e., on the means for identifying the key constraints to poverty alleviation in given rural development contexts. Such process research (strategic or applied) should involve consideration of changes over time, comparability of results across ecoregional production systems, and mechanisms for translating results through adaptive research done by NARS. 33 CHAPTER5 - GENERATING NEW AND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES: ROLE OF TME CGIAR Poverty cannot be addressed for those living on MAs if there is not some improvement in productivity on the MLs and FLs within the respective areas. Productivity increases depend to a great extent on improvement in the technologies available to meet the particular conditions found in the specific MA being addressed. Correcting policy and institutional distortions is only part of the picture; and which, in practice, have proved to be an intractable question in many countries. As indicated in Chapter 3, the poor in MAs regions in most cases are not poor only because of the biophysical quality of their land resources. In fact, in many cases, the significant areas of land within a MA may only be missing a few technical adjustments in order to take off in terms of production. Local knowledge, combined with research can often provide the answer on how to address the problems. Marginal areas are marginal for many reasons. In some cases, technologies can be developed that move lands from marginal productivity to higher productivity. The most obvious example is irrigation of deserts - where such is economically feasible and desirable. However, there are other, less obvious, but just as important examples, e.g., greater integration of range livestock systems into mixed farming or agroforestry technologies that increase productivity and farmer incomes, while at the same time reducing risk through diversification. Estimates from FAO suggest that over the next couple of decades, about 80 percent of the production expansion will be associated with yield increases and some 20 percent with agricultural land expansioni3. There is no reliable breakdown for MAs and non- MAs. However, yield increases will be an important source of growth on both areas. 5.1. The New Green Revolution - Technologies for Marginal Lands The past approach to solving the food crises of the sixties and seventies in developing countries was through the introduction of Green Revolution technologies. The result was agricultural intensification on those areas which were more favoured in terms of biophysical conditions, market access, infrastructure and supporting institutions or policy; heavy doses of fertilizers, - high-yielding fertilizer responsive varieties, fast maturing species, irrigation, improved soil and water management, and use of chemicals to control pests and diseases. There is criticism of the Green Revolution technologies, e.g., that they have resulted in increased income inequalities, in problems of salinization and waterlogging in irrigated areas, and in health problems due to heavy use of chemicals. The evidence on the seriousness of these criticisms is mixed (FAO 199614, and Freebairn 199S5). 13 14 FAO 1996. ‘World Agriculture: Towards 2010’. N. Alexandratos, ed. John Wiley & Sons. FAO 1996. ‘Lessons from the Green Revolution - Towards a New Green Revolution’. FAO Technical Background Document 6, World food Summit, 13-17 November 1996, FAO, Rome. 34 While agriculture (including ranching) legitimately can be blamed for most of the deforestation that has taken place in the world, it also is the case that the Green Revolution technologies for agricultural intensification have had some positive indirect environmental impacts related to forests. For example, the CGIAR estimates that without the technological advances brought about by the Green Revolution, some 280 million ha more land would have been needed to produce the same amount of wheat, maize, rice and other food crops that are part of the CGIAR mandate. It is doubtful whether such a large area of land would have been available, particularly in the areas where needed to meet the food requirements. But if even part of the 280 million ha would have been converted for agricultural production, a great deal more forest and fragile land would have been cleared and degraded without the Green Revolution. Despite the advances in technology and agricultural productivity, and. land savings that have taken place due to increases in per hectare productivity, forest land clearing for agriculture continues. Almost two thirds of the forest land that is deforested every year goes into agricultural expansion, including cattle ranching, particularly in the case of Latin America. On that part converted to slash and burn agriculture the relsult is marginalization of the lands cleared after three years or so. A key point here is that most of the deforestation is done by those poor people who were not the direct target of the Green Revolution - the poor who either come from the MAs or from the MAs via the cities (the rural to urban migrants coming home to the land). The way forward, in terms of reducing poverty and food insecurity and in terms of improving the environmental impacts of agriculture in MAs regions, ‘will involve a complex of factors. It will involve taking the best from the old Green Revolution technologies and combining them with a new generation of ideas, technologies, and institutional arrangements - what FAO (1996, op. tit .) calls the Second Agricultural Paradigm: It takes the natural constraints largely as given and explores the possibilities for inc.reased yields by improved genetic material and changes in management without recourse to large amounts of external inputs. It recognizes that there will be sizeable groups in the farming communities that are de facto excluded from the broader socio-economic enabling environment. . .Examples of approaches under this second paradigm include: breeding of crop varieties that are tolerant to adverse: soil conditions;. . . soil nutrient cycling;. . . reliance on genetic pest and disease resistance to replace, either partially or fully, chemical and mechanical pest control; the active use of functional biodiversity, where predators and other natural control agents of pests and diseases are actively encouraged through the maintenance of complex ecosystems within and adjacent to farming activities; and increased production from naturally trypanosomiasis-tolerant cattle and small ruminants that can lower the need for large-scale tsetse fly eradication, with its many ecological implications (p.4). 5.2. Current Activity and Future Options for the CGIAR In the recent review of CGIAR priorities and strategies, TAC concluded that for poor countries where much of the labour force is in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors and much of the average budget is spent on food and non-food products from 15 Freebaim, D.K. 1995. ‘Did the Green Revolution Concentrate Incomes? A Quantitative Study of Research Reports’. World Development. Vol. 23, pp. 265-279. 35 these three sectors, increases in the productivity of biological products (foodstuff, fodder, feed, fuelwood and raw material for people, livestock and industry) offers the best opportunity to stimulate economic growth. The rural poor engaged in the production process and/or the post-production processing activities benefit directly from such economic growth, whereas the urban poor benefit indirectly through lower prices. A significant proportion of research by the centres has been oriented to production issues which have directly benefited the poor. A good example is the work by IITA and their NARS partners on the biological control of the cassava mealy bug. This work led to integrated control of striga for improving total factor productivity of small farmers in the moist and dry savanna of sub-Saharan Africa. This benefited the poor regardless of the type of land. There is evidence that tree fallows and fodder banks promoted by ILRI have benefited poor producers in a wide variety of marginal areas in the same region. Additional examples relate to ILRI’s production systems research in the semi-arid tropics in maintenance of land productivity for livestock farmers, and the streak virus-resistant maize and the mosaic virus-free cassava cultivars released by IITA. In Asia, there is evidence that farmers’ incomes have increased in recent years as a result of the adoption of ICRISAT’s cultivars of pearl millet, sorghum, groundnut, and pigeonpea. In the case of pearl millet, the aim is improved productivity and stability in semi-arid tropical environments through development of downey mildew and ergot resistant cultivars and hybrids with drought tolerance for poor farmers. Similar examples can be cited for Latin America, e.g. the acid-tolerant rice and sorghum cultivars. For the WANA region, ICARDA’s work in the area of soil fertility and water management has provided direct benefit to the producers. In addition, its research on the rehabilitation of pasture lands has played an important part in control of degradation on grazed hillsides. Development of new and improved technology has been, and likely will continue to be, the main strength of the CGIAR. In the area of technologies that can help in the battle to alleviate poverty for those living in the MAs of the world, the CGIAR has made significant progress. The need now is to shift somewhat the focus of selected strategic research on commodity improvement, land use management, and other subjects to fit within the (diverse, site-specific MA) poverty alleviation focus suggested here. This means, among other things, more attention to drought resistance and varieties tolerant to salinity and focusing additional efforts on the problems of the acid soils, issues related to nutrient mining, water harvesting and other water management technologies, to name a few examples. The choice of focus should be made by the centres, in the context of the MAs to which their research applies, either individually or in concert with others. The role of biotechnology in genome mapping and the development of cultivars resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses also is of importance when looking at the potential contributions of the CGIAR to marginal lands research. There are many opportunities to develop “ . . .technologies that can be usefully employed given the existing, often adverse, conditions” l6 found in the MAs. Such technologies can be of immense benefit to the poor; and, if coupled with activity in the other areas discussed here - institutional and 16 Ravenborg, H.M. 1993. ‘Targeting International Agricultural Research Towards the Rural Poor’. CDR Working Paper 93.4 (Centre for Development Research in cooperation with IFPRI). 36 policy reform, diversification and niche opportunities - they can provide one important input for poverty alleviation. Within the context of working on poverty alleviation for those living in MAs, the Panel believes that the centres and their various partners in research should be developing new and improved technologies that respond to site conditions found in MAs, e.g., varieties resistant to a variety of abiotic stresses. This should not be interpreted to mean the centres should engage in .research on genetic improvement or management systems for hundreds of speciality crops and animals which may offer niche potentials in an equal or greater number of site-specific (or site-type) situations. As mentioned above, the CGIAR is already doing research on a wide range of products which are relevant to the poor in MAs. The new dimension may imply a few additional products, but the main thrust is on research (biophysical and social science) aimed at increasing the income options available to the poor. A prerequisite is research to clarify the capabilities, constraints and range of options (agriculture and non-agriculture) available in a set of MA situations, into which it is expectled to apply the Svstem’s research results - species, management, value added, etc. The ingredients introduced through the CGIAR will be research in the mandated biophysical area, responsive to constraints and opportunities in MAs, plus .interrelated social science research aimed at new institutional arrangements which will enable the poor to mobilize their indigenous knowledge on niches and value added. The role of the CGIAR in the latter area is in the development of approaches to constraint analysis and assessment of options. 37 CHAPTER 6 - DIVERSIFYING LAND USE SYSTEMS AND INCOME OPPORTUNITIES: ROLE OF THE CGIAR The Director General of FAO, in commenting on the marginal lands issue, points out that: In marginal areas, farmers often spread the risk by engaging in mixed systems that combine agriculture with other economic activities. We need to draw upon such ancestral wisdom and encourage combined activities in their appropriate ecological and socio-economic setting. They are an expression of sustainable agricultural development, successfully merging cropping, stock raising, poultry farming, fish culture, forestry, hunting and gathering, the sale of produce on local markets, seasonal migration and all sorts of activities that mark the rhythm ‘of a farming household’s working year. (Statement of the DG on the occasion of World Food Day, Rome, 16 October, 1996) Poverty is associated with significant risks for the poor. They do not have the “safety net” that richer people have through their savings and, most commonly, through the social systems to which they belong. The poor often are on their own - in fact that is a major factor associated with their poverty, which derives from the institutional and policy context. However, correcting policy and institutional problems is only part of the picture. Diversification of land use and farming system activities and income opportunities cuts across nearly all poverty situations in MAs. The Panel recognizes that some of the diversification options mentioned below are merely part of a “holding pattern” - stop-gap measures that will maintain rural poor, but not lead to poverty alleviation and economic development. For that to happen, broader markets need to develop for non-agricultural products, .education and technology development need to come to the forefront; and access for the poor to various social services and income generating opportunities needs to be improved. These changes are . far beyond the scope and mandate of the CGIAR in its present form. It can help in terms of what it knows best - the institutional and technological change related to agriculture, agroforestry , forestry, and fisheries. 6.1. Diversi&ation: Nature of the Needs and Opportunities. Diversification can involve a number of things - and the type of diversification that best fits a situation in MAs will depend very much on the nature of the poverty issues in that particular region. Where diversification is to be-based on natural resources available to the poor, it is evident that knowledge of the biophysically marginal and favoured lands within any specific MA will be critical. In general, the most promising types of diversification opportunities include the following: . b increased integration and further intensification of livestock in mixed farming systems - expansion of on-farm activities; b introduction or improvement of agroforestry systems that provide various products both, for home consumption and for markets, and that improve agricultural productivity in some cases; b increased integration of forest-based activities into overall farming systems development and into poverty alleviation programmes for the landles#s; increased blending of off-farm employment and income generating activities with farm system management and increased vertical integration of farm activities from field to consumer using new developments in postharvest technologies; increased use of niche opportunities - using exotic and indigenous, often underutilized, plants and animals; and taking advantage of small areas of good land, or other unique attributes, to produce high value crops such as flowers, herbs, spices, rabbits, honey, etc. 6.2. Livestock: Expansion of On-Farm Activities 38 Animal products are generally characterized by a high consumer preference. Given this, and the “walking~bank” role of animals in small farms, farmers tend to respond favourably to opportnnities for increasing the numbers of small or large animals to improve farm income. Thus, diversifying production into mixed crop-livestock systems or intensifying livestock production is often of strong interest to farmers in most parts of the world. At the farm level, livestock can contribute to sustainability with its various interfaces with cropping and with the farming household (sales can be year-round sources of cash income, animals serve as mobile assets, supply of fuel material, supply of nutrient rich food). The integration and intensification of livestock keeping is a reliable way to stimulate income or consumption growth at the farm level, especially when farm-based inputs can be used in this process. In diversification, farm animals play an important linkage role between different sub-sets of the farming system as means of draught power for recycling nutrients and enhancing land productivity. Crop by-products and refuse can be fed to monogastric as well as ruminant animals. Under diversified land use coarse . grains and (sown) pastures, fodder trees, and fodder shrubs on marginal lands can provide feed and can also restore soil fertility. The year-round increase’of livestock production is, furthermore, an ideal way to increase labour productivity. mile cropping is characterized by peak labour demands, the steady work needed for livestock husbandry can spread requirements more evenly over time, thereby increasing labour efficiency. On-farm processing of animal products (butter, ghee, cheese) and local self-marketing are other possibilities to add value by linking available labour with production resources to obtain the larger benefits. Examples of expansion of on-farm activities involving livestock are given in Box 2. Box 2: Expansion of on-farm activities through livestock Example .I: Stall Feeding In Kenya a small .farm of 0.3 hectare supports Thomas Nzaea, his wife, three children and grandmother by a system of no-graze dairy production. Thomas converted the farm from the typical crops such as maize, beans and. cash crops to a stall feeding dairy byproducts farm. The fodder from a hybrid of Leucaena leucocephala’and Calliandra calothyrsus is used as feed. Flowers fi-om the trees provide nectar for side production of honey. The manure from the cattle is abundant enough to fertilize his field. The field is cropped with rows of the hybrid and spinach and other greens. Fuelwood is always abundant. The excess milk and manure are sold. Complimentary feeds are purchased and extra money is reinvested. Thomas puichased a shredder that mixes the fodder to an optimal nutritional formula and put his children through school. Prinsley, R.T., 1990.

Example 2: Desertified Land Reclamation: Desertification is a serious problem in many regions of the world. A project in northwest .Peru, covering 1000 hectare, is attempting to reverse the tides. The area is characterized as semi- desert sand dunes. Three varieties of trees have been planted: Prosopis chilensis, P. limensis and P. juliflora, with a spacing of IO m x 10 m, five seeds to a hole. The trees are intercropped with beans from year I to Gear 4, from year 4 to year 30 pods from the trees will be used for animal feed, food, molasses and honey, sheep grazing and bird hunting wiIl be introduced during this time period. At year 30 timber will he harvested and regeneration initiated. In addition, the stand will provide woodfuel. Two years into the project trees are producing fruit at about US%25 per hectare and pods at US!$200 per hectare. Tian van Nao, 1983. Agroforestry Systems and Some Research Problems, In: Huxley, P.A.; 1983. “Plant Research and Agroforestry. ’ ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya. 6.3. Agroforestry: Making Marginal Lands More Productive Agroforestry is widely practised and has been for centuries in most countries. In major parts of the developing world, it is the main form of land use and a major contributor to sustainability. Yet, because agroforestry lies in the hazy area somewhere between the fields of forestry and agriculture, it does not have the constituency, nor receive the attention it deserves in the policy arena in terms of its potential to contribute to poverty alleviation for those who live in MAs. Agroforestry to a great extent evolved in response to needs and to sustainability concerns related to resiliency, flexibility, and avoidance of negative side effects of agriculture. Because of its blending of production with protection, it fits nicely with the concept of conservation and forces divergent views to focus on sustaining the overall productivity of land in MAs. 40 By design agroforestry should provide both environmental and productivity benefits. At the same time, farmers have to be aware that the use of trees in agricultural systems is not always positive in terms of sustainability and income generation. For example, trees can be introduced in such a way that they compete for space, light, nutrients, and water with other crops, thus possibly reducing the overall value of production. Experience and careful study are needed to find those combinations of trees and other land uses that maximize overall sustainable production. The need fo:r careful research on agroforestry is most pronounced in relation to biophysically marginal areas, where sensitivity to misuse tends to be greater. In some cases, it might mean no trees; in other cases, it might mean total forest cover. In between are the productive agroforestry systems. Based on ICRAF’s experience these systems can contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainability of farming in MAs in three important ways: l building in flexibility to deal with uncertainty and the dynamics of changing needs; l improving the resiliency of a land use; and l creating positive externalities and linkages among land-use practices and their impacts. 6.4. Forests and Diversification of Land Use Activities’for Poverty . Alleviation The links between forests, trees, food security and deforestation shown in Figure . 6.1 indicate that there is a two-way relationship between agriculture and forests. On the one hand, the major source of deforestation is agriculture (particularly slash.and burn agriculture and large scale cattle ranching). On the other hand, agroforestry systems and forests contribute to increased food security, income generation and poverty alleviation. Packages of new options for diversification in MAs include improved use of forests and trees. It has been estimated that a significant part of rural poor people: depend in a major way on forests for their benefit flows. The Panel recognizes that improvement and expansion of forest and tree related activity by the poor in MAs is only one small part of the diversification needed. However, in some areas it can be an important part in solving the poverty alleviation puzzle. Some promising areas of forest and tree related diversification - at least in the’ early stages of development - include the following: Forest foods for subsistence ,and as sources of income. Outputs from the forest (bushmeat and fish, fruits, nuts, gums, resins, and so forth) supplement agricultural outputs in many parts of the world. Studies by IFPN, CIFOR and others indicate that farmers in many forest regions of the world, e.g., Zaire Basin and the Amazon, depend as much on the surrounding forest as the farm for their food and other prolducts, both 41 those used on the farm and marketed. A study for over 60 countries showed that game and fish contribute 20 percent or more of the animal protein in the average human diet. Another study estimated that around 1974 some 75 percent of sub-Saharan Africa depended largely on traditional wildlife sources of protein. Many similar studies confirm these general orders of magnitude17. The ASB research programme is addressing the potentials for improved linkages between forest fringe farming, use of forests, poverty alleviation, and reductions in deforestation. Bioenergy from trees. Fuelwood grown on farms, or taken from forests, provides the major source of cooking and heating energy for a majority of people in most developing countries. Adequate fuel is an essential ingredient in any poverty alleviation programme. Fuelwood, particularly converted to charcoal, provides a significant source of income for many rural people. It provides another link in the diversification of rural activity in many MAs. However, much research is needed to understand the various linkages between use of fuelwood, deforestation, and health issues (mainly from the inhalation of smoke). Protecting watersheds. Forests and use of trees in land use systems can contribute to downstream agriculture, e.g., through regulation of water flows and quality that directly affects irrigation options. Furthermore, it is well known that forests have a beneficial and regulating impact on the hydrological conditions of a watershed, such as the presence of springs, higher groundwater level, creeks with water for longer time periods. 6.5. Expansion of Off-Farm Employment and Vertical Integration of Farm Activities - In many parts of the world, e.g., in the middle Himalayas, parts of the highlands of Africa and Latin America and drylands, population growth is such that expansion of off- farm sources of employment will become a necessity. The land in those areas just will not support the growing numbers of people. We can illustrate the potentials with some numbers from the small scale enterprise sector involving trees and forest products. FAO estimates, for example, that India currently has some 30 million persons working in forest-related enterprises. In Brazil, more than two million people earn a significant part of their income from activities associated with extraction of various products from the wild babassu palm. Similar stories abound from around the world. Many of these activities involve women and provide them with a supplemental source of income, often used to purchase food. 17 Redford, K., R. Godshalk and K. Asher. 1995. ‘What about Wild Animals? Wild Animal Species in Community Forestry in the Tropics ‘. FAO Community Forestry Note 13. FAO. Rome, Italy. 96pp. 42 Figure 6.1: Links Between Forests and Food Production 43 Many other important sources of off-farm income exist. Their development often becomes the first step in evolving a balanced economy that goes beyond nearly total dependence on agriculture for income. Yet, the Panel recognizes the problems involved in generating markets. Most commonly, the products produced in these small scale enterprises are not of the quality where they can be exported out of the region; and the local markets, because of the depressed nature of much of the agriculture, are not large enough to support significant off-farm activity. The CGIAR has a limited role in this area. However, in some instances, it might be a catalyst in linking increased farm activity to off-farm opportunities. Another area which recently was reported on by a TAC panel is that of postharvest technologies. That study” recommended that the CGIAR give greater emphasis to the harvest and postharvest components of the production-to-consumption continuum. In MAs, postharvest losses can be great; value added to crops can go outside the regions; and opportunities to generate added off-farm employment can be lost. Thus, the Panel endorses the recommendations of the TAC postharvest technology study as being relevant to improvement in conditions in MAs and, ultimately, can contribute to poverty alleviation. An example is CIAT’s work on storage, processing and marketing of cassava in the Andean region. 6.6. Increased Emphasis on Niche Opportunities and Underutilized Plants and Animals Closely related to livestock, agroforestry, postharvest technology and vertical integration options, is the opportunity to diversify on the basis on “niche” opportunities. These generally are crops that currently are underutilized, for which promising technologies and defined markets exist, and for which there is suitable pockets of land within the MAs. Examples include, spices, herbs, mushrooms, honey bees, various tree crops, flowers, fruits and vegetables. Experience to date indicates that individual opportunities, with a few exceptions, are not large. However, on a cumulative basis, niche crops can be an important element in an overall diversification and poverty alleviation programmes (see Box 3). Possibilities exist also to integrate aquaculture activities into farming systems in some parts of the world. Gains through research have led to some promising varieties of tilapia, carp, and so forth. ICLARM is in the forefront of this work. 6.7. Current Activity and Future Options for the CGIAR With the introduction of agroforestry, forestry, and fisheries into the CGIAR, the System already had started on the road towards research on issues related to land use and 18 TAC Secretariat. 1996. ‘Harvest and Postharvest Problems in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries - The CGIAR Contribution to Research -‘. (SDR/TAC:IAR/96/5). 44 farming system diversification. The strong emphasis on NRM, in an INRM context (cf. TAC’s Soil and Water strategic study), has led a number of centres to emphasize Box 3: Niche Opportqnities In the semi arid parts of India in small pockets people produce grapes and oranges and tamarind which not only have nationwide demand; but the products are exported as brand names such as Mahagrapes from the state of Maharastra; the s&e is true of onion, garlic and red chilfy. In many MAL areas, vegetable seeds are produced ‘for green revolution FAL areas, .as the former’s climate is disease and poIlution free. This occurs more in hill areas where they not only produce disease free seeds, but off-season vegetables as well as flowers and fruits for the FAL and their urban centres. Sericulture and dryland honiculmre are picking up even on small farms in areas as dry as Western Rajasthan in India. Recent trends in small-state stall-fed goat raising, and angora rabbit rearing have helped the poor, as these enterprises do not need much land or investment; and they are ‘highly productive both biologically and econoniically . ICRISAT generated high-yielding pigeonpea cultivars which, aside from commercial use, is also planted in courtyards by farmers and landless households for quick production and sale as green vegetable in villages nearer the towns. In most of these cases accessibility and nearness of market has played an important role. These processes recently have been encouraged by entry of organized private sector entities in rural areas following the liberalization of the economy. In- some cases NGOs have helped. Replication of such small-scale initiatives can make a big difference to the situation of the poor in marginal areas. both production and conservation objectives related to diversification. The latter objective is important to the CGIAR portfolio, since in some cases diversification can lead to even more rapid environmental degradation than currently exists. Examples of targeted research activities for developing diversity are: JCRAF’s work on small-holder agroforestry systems for the desert margins to alleviate fodder shortages and fence in livestock, enhance soil fertility and address problems of desertification; ICRISAT’s work on short-season chickpea improvement and management for post rainy season production in dry and warm marginal environments to diversify existing cropping systems in Asia and East Africa; CIAT’s programme for hillsides in Latin America; and ICARDA’s work on low-cost improvement of native pastures in marginal lands and rangelands for increasing productivity of pastoralists and nomadic herders; and inter-centre work on developing alternatives to slash and burn agriculture. The Panel emphasized the importance of keeping sustainability concerns uppermost in mind as diversification options are explored. In the context of sustainable poverty alleviation associated with MAs, the Panel reconfirms TAC’s view, supported by the CGIAR members, that strengthening research on NRM and environmental issues is needed in the CGIAR, as is a more explicit linking of this area of research to the Lucerne 45 “vision” of CGIAR contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable food security. Because of their significance in relation to poverty alleviation, we repeat the pertinent TAC conclusions regarding NRM here: * TAC reaffirms and emphasizes the point: The System should with few exceptions only be doing environmental and NRM related research that is clearly identified with the impacts of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on sustainable poverty alleviation and food security. * TAC confirms that research on both aspects of land use impacts - on-site and off-site - are priority areas for research in an integrated natural resources management (INRM) research framework such as is needed in the System. * TAC concludes that once the necessary condition has been met, i.e., the proposed research is identified in a positive way with impacts on sustainable poverty alleviation and food security, then adjustments in specific research may logically be made to take into account potential benefits in terms of other aspects of environmental improvement and health. Such adjustments should, of course, consider the cost implications. In fact, much of the research undertaken by the System does contribute to these other goals (even though such research was initiated in the System only because of its links to sustainable poverty alleviation and food security through agriculture, forestry and fisheries)lg. The CGIAR has traditionally focused on the crop production end of the farming system. Taking more of a poverty alleviation focus, and realizing the importance to the poor of diversifying income generating activities, the Panel suggests that the CGIAR needs to pay more attention to mixed crop-livestock-tree systems. In other words, systems that simultaneously capture different elements of the MA resource potentials need greater attention. For example, integrated systems involving aquaculture, wetland rice, livestock, and agroforestry are likely to contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development of inland valleys of sub-Saharan Africa. The Panel notes that the work by NGOs has shown that poverty alleviation in MAs often is identified with local action. Also poverty alleviation involves diversification of activities and of sources of income and opportunities for improvement (cf. recent speech by DG of FAO20). Research related to opportunity access for the poor is frequently situation specific. At the same time, the CGIAR by its nature must focus research on those areas where it is most cost-effective in providing international public goods. The Panel believes that there are a number of potential areas related to poverty alleviation that fall within the international public goods category. They include such things as research related to: development of methods and processes for assessment of poverty alleviation constraints; poverty processes and the dynamics of poverty (mainly linked to the role of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors); comparative analysis of location-specific linkages among environment, technology, agricultural development and poverty alleviation; off-farm employment opportunities; and post-harvest technology. 19 20 Examples include: biological control undertaken primarily because of the rising costs of chemical control with increasing resistance, but benefiting also farmer health and the environment; trees grown on farms for food, wood and forage, but helping to control erosion and, if native species, helping also to conserve biodiversity. Op. cit. 46 Any decision on broadening the research agenda along the above lines should only be taken after an examination of the options, potential poverty impacts and alternative suppliers of such research. The Panel recognises that precisely because of the international public goods requirement, the CGIAR must proceed with caution into an area of poverty alleviation which requires a site-specific MA focus. The System can only be a minor part in the total research effort devoted to the types of islsues and topics arising from this focus. The challenge lies in investing scarce resources in such a way as to catalyze further R&D investments by others. Hence the importance placed on implementing Recommendations 2, 3 and 4 once a first approximation has been made of the characteristics of MAs: where are the marginal rural people? why are they poor? and the scope and nature of options open to the CGIAR to effect change towards sustainable poverty alleviation (Recommendation 1). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Panel members wish to express their sincere appreciation to TAC and its Secretariat for their cooperation throughout the course of this Study. All CGIAR Centres fully cooperated with the Study Panel and the TAC Secretariat during the Study, and they deserve our special thanks for this. FAO, IFAD and The World Bank provided considerable support to the Study particularly in making available information on land resources, forestry, population and poverty. Panel members also visited these and other institutions to discuss key issues related to marginal lands. These interactions proved extremely valuable and the Panel wishes to acknowledge this with thanks - particularly helpful were comments provided by Nikos Alexandratos of FAO and Pierre Crosson of RFF. The Panel wishes to acknowledge the significant contribution of Dr. Amir Kassam as Panel Secretary and the excellent efforts of Dr. Filemon Torres and Mr. Jan Peter Groenewold, TAC Secretariat Consultants, in the preparation of Annexes II and IV. The Panel expresses its special appreciation to Ms. Ann Drummond of the TAC Secretariat, for valuable assistance in the preparation of this report. ANNEX1 TERMS OF REFERENCE The terms of reference for the study are to: (1) Examine concepts and definitions for use by the CGIAR: (2) (3) Examine potentials for research gains from inherently marginal lands (regardless of production potentials relative to other lands) in terms of: (a) the per hectare gains possible on.the individual marginal land types (by ecosystem or region); and (b) the total area of individual marginal land types on which gains could be applied; (c) the policy gains (e.g., related to incentives) that might be derived from research. Indicate how such gains would be distributed among people/groups. Indicate how such gains would be distributed among people/groups, with a focus on how the poor would gain, both now and in the future. Development an assessment of how the marginal lands issue relates to: (a) common property issues and research (since a large proportion of . marginal lands is in common property status); (b) links between marginal lands research and development of off-farm employment (looking at the marginal lands issue in a. holistic context of how expanded off-farm employment could relieve pressures on the farm population that has to depend on the land for survival and income); and (c) development of new, more sustainable farm technologies. In each case provide a judgement on . the role of CGIAR research in dealing with the issue. (4) Make suggestions on future CGIAR priorities and strategies for research work on marginal lands, including whether the current level of effort is adequate in relation to that devoted to other land types. AN-NEXH METHODOLOGY APPLIED FOR THE DATABASE As part of the study a database was created to specify marginal and non-marginal lands and their characteristics including: land use and area, soil classes, moisture regime, total and rural population and rural poverty. The scope of the database was to indicate orders of magnitude of different land types in the developing regions, i.e. the extent of favourable and less favourable lands for agricultural purposes, the extent of forest and woodlands and of dry areas and the numbers of rural people and rural poor living on them. 1. Primary Data The primary data used on land area and population was supplied by FAO/Land and Water Division. The countries land area by soil classes information was derived from the digitized FAO Soil Map of the World at a scale of 15 million, overlaid with agroclimatic maps. This data was georeferenced to cells of 5 square minutes, an area of about 30 km2 at the Equator. For every country the output was a file with: l soil/terrain - 11 classes characterized as follows: l- 2- 3- 4- 5- 6- 7- saline/sodic soils: with high salt content/exchangeable sodium saturation; 8- acid sulphate soils: soils in which sulphidic materials have accumulated; 9- organic soils/peat soils: composed to more than 50% of organic material; 10 - no problem soils: no constraints to sustained agricultural production; 11 - “miscellaneous” lands (mainly water bodies). sloping terrain: steeply dissected with slopes in excess of 30 % ; shallow soils: with depth limitations within 50 cm of the surface caused by the presence of coherent and hard rock or hard-pans; poorly drained soils: waterlogged and/or flooded for a significant part of the year; coarse textured soils: coarse in texture or having gravel, stones, boulders, rock outcrops in surface layers or at the surface; heavy cracking clays: with high clay content and deep cracks occurring at some point in time in most years (unless irrigated); infertile soils: with deficiencies in major, secondary and minor plant nutrients when cultivated; 0 moisture regime - 16 reference length of growing period (LGP)’ classes in 30 day intervals of “rainfed” moisture availability and temperatures that permit plant growth; The resolution for the files extracted was at 0.1% , i.e., percentage values of the total surface or population of a country below a tenth of percent per cell were not Annex II - Page 2 recorded during the extraction. This fact can lead to a limited loss of land areas in the output files, especially for large countries. h, feature of the soil/land types constraints information is that they are mutually exclusive, i.e., these are used in a sieving approach with the sequence of soil characteristics above. In this way the first land type, sloping, would have all the soils with more than 30% slope in the data irrespective of their further soil characteristics, including therefore also sandy and/or infertile soils in Be sloping class. The sequence is somewhat arbitrary but geared towards agricultural purposes, i.e., the niost limiting factor - or the most. vulnerable aspect with regard to erosion potential - steepness, is excluded first. The sequence of the soil classes therefore influences the results for soil/terrain types 1 to 9, whereas the type 10 “no constraint” can be seen as the.output of the sieving and their values are not affected by the order of sieving., With this method the surface area information is additive to 100 % . The countries’ population data was estimated by a study team of Santa Barbara University in 1989. It was extracted in the same set-up as the terrain/soil data above, and a country’s cell with land area informatiqn has a corresponding cell with population information in a second file. The &b-national level population data used by the Santa Barbara, University was spread to the corresponding georeferenced land assuming an homogeneous population density across the administrative area. Country values on percentages rural population and rural poor. people were takqn from data based on UNDP Human Development Report 1994. 2. Calculation of land type and population values Country summary files were created which contain the information for land areas . and population by soil characteristics and LGPs. The approach followed t.o derive from this data a breakdown for different land types and for population is shown graphically in Figure II. 1. By combining this data set on soil characteristics and LGPs with a further data source on the extent of forest and woodlands in the countries (FAO Forestry.Statistics Today for Tomotiow, 1995), the land area could be grouped into three major categories (favoured lands, forest and woodlands, and arid area) to derive marginal algricultural lands, the fourth category, as a residue. First, the favoured lands were defined as soil type 10 (no constraints) with LGPs above 75 days, taken as a lower limit Iof rainfed cultivation and grazing, and significant .forest and woodland growth. Assuming an even distribution of forests and woodlands in the countries, these favoured la& were reduced by theecountries’ share of forests and woodlands and the balance are the favoured agricultural lands (FAL). Arid areas (LGPs below 30 days) and the countries’ residue of forest and woodlands are subtracted from the data for the other soil characteristics to determine the extent of marginal ‘a@icultural lands (MAL). These MALs are the land areas above 30 days of LGP on sloping, shallow, coarse, heavy cracking, etc., lands, but exclude the forest and woodlands and the arid areas of the country. They would, however, include grazing lands. The results of this assessment at regional. level are given in Table 2.3. Annex II - Page 3 To show the importance of irrigation in arid regions of the world a further column was inserted in Table 2.3. The values show the extent of irrigated areas in arid lands. This data is an estimate for country level irrigated lands (data from TAC 1992, Priorities and Strategies database) which was overlaid with LGP information. The physical area of the irrigated lands would be contained in the values for the arid lands, whereas the land type itself would be classified in the category favoured agricultural lands. Rural population data is shown at the regional aggregate level in Table 2.4. The procedure applied stemmed from the above classification for the land areas but was essentially simpler and, unfortunately, less refined. The population values on FAL were derived as the sum of the population figures for the favoured lands (soil class 10 with no soil constraints and with LGP > 75 days), and the remainder was set as the country rural population on “other” land types, including marginal agricultural, forests and woodlands and desert areas. The information for forest cover could & be used to differentiate people living on good lands between agriculture and forestry, in this case the value was used as an estimate for rural population on prime lands only. Furthermore, country values for rural poverty (based on UNDP data) were used as factors to derive an estimate of rural poor living on less favoured lands.

Thus, as stated in the proposal for the study, “TAC favours allocating resources such that the balance between high and low potential environments emerges from the concern with poverty alleviation and resource conservation, rather than being introduced a priori.” TAC’s views regarding research priorities for marginal lands are based on the premise that a balance of effort is required between the marginal lands and the non marginal or “high potential lands”. It is not an issue of research investments in one land type against the other, but rather of assessing research priorities against the criteria of poverty alleviation, protection of the environment (sustainability) and efficiency (productivity enhancement). As stated in the Lucerne Declaration, the CGIAR research agenda should address problems of the poor in both less endowed and high potential areas, From an agricultural productivity and production perspective, a further implication of the focus on poverty alleviation is that the CGIAR is concerned not only with the per hectare potential of different classes of land (i.e., their maximum potential level of production), but also with the scope for overall improvement in poverty reduction and food security through its R & D. That means that the overall levels of production that can be achieved on the farmers’ fields are directly relevant to investment decisions in research. We can think of those overall levels as being a product of the average attainable sustainable yield increase per hectare (Y) and the area on which that yield increase can be achieved (A). Thus, (A x Y) becomes the relevant focus. Thus, it may be that one million ha. of land (A) with moderate productivity, with a feasible improvement of say 0.5 tonne per hectare (Y), is a better prospect for future R & D investment than a smaller area of say 50,000 ha. of already improved high productivity irrigated land, where the product of A x Y is lower. In other words, in this case, additional CGIAR research related to marginal lands can make a greater difference than spending the resources in a favored area. We can put these thoughts in more expanded form as follows: Targeting research investment to a given area of marginal land, A. In a sustainable poverty alleviation context, but with a focus on production of Annex III - Page 2 crops (food, livestock, forest, or fish), the contribution of CGIAR research ‘5” to poverty alleviation can be formulated conceptually as follows: ((4 ) X (Yi)} X (Ipop) + OFi + Si = Gi (1) where, Ai = size of area that benefits from CGIAR research i. yi = average sustainable net income (or net benefit or use value) increase per unit area due to CGIAR research i (where “sustainable” incorporates the the environmental protection constraint; and “net” income means benefits actually captured by the farmer net of the associated costs of achieving the benefits; the benefits can come from policy gains as well ars productivity increases; values appropriately adjusted to present value (PV) terms through use of appropriate discount rate). 5 oP = index for number of poor people gaining or benefiting from (A x Yi), weighted for: (a) degree of poverty affected (e.g., proportion “poorest of the poor”); and (b) extent to which those other than the producers of (A x Yi) gain from lower prices due to (A x Yi); OFi = measure of net gain from off-farm activity in A due to research i, weighted for the extent to which poor people benefit from the gain (again, in PV terms); si = spillover impacts, or externality impacts (in PV terms); Gi = measure of gain from research i, (which, given the left side of the equation, is a measure of production increase, or net income increase, due to the research, weighted for a poverty alleviation objective); As mentioned, this formulation considers poverty alleviation impacts with a focus on agricultural, forestry, or Jisheries production. If we limit consideration to marginal agricultural lands (MAL), then A of course would reflect the particular MAL area being considered. However, as discussed below, the formulation can be used to look (at least conceptually) at all types of land (both FAL and MAL). In this format, we are asking the following question: given the potential area for crop x or y, what kind of per hectare income increase could be generated. by research related to this crop? (Obviously, in order to identify a relevant A, we have to have some particular crop(s) in mind.) Targeting research investment to a given marginalized population We also can change the formulation to make the primary objective be poverty alleviation. This then would be the primary determinant of Gi for a given CGIAR research investment, i, in terms of a given target population of poor or marginalized people (some farmers, some perhaps not). If one takes a poor people focus and looks at research investment from that perspective, then the following formulation might be more appropriate: Annex III - Page 3 (poPi x yPoP ) + Si = Gi where, POpi = population of poor people targeted by research i; (the population could be associated with any number of characteristics that relate to poverty) yPoP = average per capita net benefit flow gain for POpi due to CGIAR research i (such research could be focused on crops and other things that could generate benefits) Si and Gi = as before, except G now is expressed in terms of poverty alleviation measure; Given the above formulations, which apply equally to “marginal” as to “non- marginal” lands, there is no necessary reason why, for a given (Ai x Yi) or (POpi x Y .,), the CGIAR should be interested more in marginal vs. non-marginal lands, except i the marginaZ lands (defined by A) have proportionally Zarger populations of poor f” people who can gain from changes due to the research’, i.e., the Ipop that applies is higher; or POpi for the marginal lands is higher, other things being equal. These $Op and POpi conditions define “marginal areas” (MA) used in the study regardless of whether the lands on which this population lives is biophysically marginal or favoured. From a strategic public investment point of view, maximizing returns (G) per unit of scarce CGIAR resource ($R) may be regarded as a rational criterion for allocation; (where $R is the amount invested to get the response G). Thus, we have a measure of research investment eficiency as follows: Research investment efficiency. This could be measured by Gi per $ of CGIAR and associated research expenditure, when both are appropriately discounted to the same point in time: (Gi/$Ri) = research efficiency; (3) We would want to find that set of research opportunities that maximizes G for the research budget (i.e., we would seek to maximize the net present worth of the research investment). We can further modify this formulation to look at the social cost-efictiveness of research investments - which should be the ultimate objective sought, once we have eliminated all those potential research investments that have Gi < $R. Also, aside from this question of research efficiency, there is a question of distribution of benefits. This is taken into account by the equation above through Ipop and the discount rate used. Annex III - Page 4 Social cost-effectiveness or “impact”. (Gi/$Ri) only considers the: efficiency element, i.e., production of the research results. The real aim is to get research in place in the farmer’s fields or in the forest or on the grazing lands. Thus, we need to introduce $Ei, or the extension and transfer costs, to come out with an array of opportunities ordered on the basis of: Gi/($%+$Ei) (4) Adding $E to the equation assumes that the CGIAR is interested in research applied on the ground as an ultimate test of success - the $E may not come from the CGIAR, but has to be considered, since it is a necessary cost of getting research in use. This also raises a question on the need for research into institutional determinants of $E. Finally, we also have the strategic question of equity, or distribution of benefits, as a criterion for allocation. If the calculations of Gi in relation to $R and $E do not produce results that are acceptable, then the decision-makers need to go back and discuss and possibly readjust Ipop or the discount rate! The Panel puts forth the above formulation only as an annex, since it represents only the beginning thinking for a broader discussion of priority setting. However, the Panel felt it worth including in its report, since it does provide a conceptual perspective on the differences and similarities that exist when one focuses on a land/productivity measure of research return versus a poverty alleviation measure. ANNEX IV CURRENT CGIAR ACTIVITIES As part of the Study a desk analysis of current allocation of CGIAR research resources to the different land types identified in Annex II was undertaken. In addition to estimating total research investments in the different agricultural quadrants (i.e., I to IV), the analysis was also expected to identify allocation patterns among the 12 CGIAR activity categories across land types, if any. Available information on research expenditures by projects funded by the CGIAR System is very rarely presented in terms of targeted “land domains”. Actually, a brief characterisation of the natural resource base on which projects focus their activities is not a descriptor in the standard format used for the 1997 compilation of CGIAR Research-Project Details (1997 R-PD). As a consequence, the exercise was run in two phases. The first sought to elicit from the CGIAR Centres information on project agroecological targets, in terms of relevant moisture zones, as characterized by length of growing period (LGP), and soil classes (SCs), and on activity patterns across land targets. The second phase attempted to re-calculate project resource allocations in relation to the identified land types, as well as to assess their stated poverty alleviation focus in terms of objectives, outputs and beneficiaries. 1. Methodology Project information was taken from the CGIAR 1997 R-PD, ,Centres’ 1997 Programme Plans and Funding Requirements (PP&FRs) and Medium Term Plans (MTPs). ICLARM, IPGRI and ISNAR and most of IFPRI’s projects were not included in the analysis. Data was used to estimate project resource allocation to moisture zones - as represented by LGPs - and research activities within six geographical regions. Among-region estimates followed Regional Expenditures in Table 3 of the PP&FRs, while LGP estimates were based on the FAO’s agro-ecological zones information for the different regions. Activity shares were taken from “standards” presented in Table la of the PP&FRs. Estimates of resources allocated to CGIAR activities within regional LGPs were then submitted to the corresponding Centres for their verification. They covered 279 projects out of a total of 374 projects endorsed for 1997, accounting for 80% of the total CGIAR budget. Resources allocated to LGPs within regions were reviewed by most Centres, but only one provided information on soil domains. None indicated changes in the standard share of activities when the project target moved across different land types. In the second phase research expenditures were allocated to land types (quadrants). The basic assumption was that Centres allocate their resources in proportion to the importance of the area and land use covered by SCs within regions and LGPs in which they operate. Project budgets were then subjected to the following allocation process: l first, among regions and LGPs, in correspondence with resources allocated by Centres to LGPs within regions; Annex IV - Page 2 a second, among land types within LGPs (Table l), in proportion to soil classes - which were grouped as soils with no physical constraints (No. lo), with high production potential (Nos. 3-6), and those with low potential (Nos. l-2 & 7-9) assuming no major land development to improve land quality; 0 third, between land types I and II, according to LGP-specific proportions of . lands under QI’ and QII in relevant countries of the region. II Table 1: Rules to Allocate Research Resources to Land Types Moisture Environment Irrigation LGP 75-120 days LGP > 120 days Q I/Q II QIII Q III QN Q I/Q II Q III Q IV An unbiased application of this method requires that the actual soil classes in the project land areas are known. Unfortunately, as no information could be provided by Centres on the project soil domains, we were compelled to apply the proportions among SCs within LGPs from the FAO/Land and Water Division database. As these are the same as those used to calculate land shares among quadrants in Annex II, proportions of land types (quadrants) and estimated resource allocations are bound to be correlated. 2. Results Table 2 shows how CGIAR resources are being allocated across land types within the six geographical regions. Tentative shares are based on estimates of resources allocated by each of 279 projects to the agroecological focus(i) of their activities. Table 2: SHARE OF CGIAR-WIDE PROJECT RESOURCES AMONG LAND TYPES WITFIIN REGIONS (as percentages of total within region) Land Types (Quadrants) Regions I II III IV Globally E&S-AFRICA 26.2% 57.4% 16.3% 18.1% W&C-AFRICA 29.9% 57.2% 12.9% 23.1% S&SE-ASIA 27.5% 14.6% 34.1% 23.7% 32.3% WANA 21.2% 25.3% 27.0% 26.4% 11.0% LAC (MesoAmerica) 32.5% 14.1% 27.7% 25.7% 4.7% LAC (SouthAmerica) 12.6% 15.8% 59.1% 12.4% 10.8% GLOBALLY 26.0% 10.0% 45.0% 19.0% 100.0% Annex IV - Page 3 Notwithstanding the methodological reservations, shares indicate that about one third of CGIAR resources are invested on the favourable agricultural lands of Qs I and II (FALs), and the remaining two thirds to the so-called marginal agricultural lands (MALs) of Qs III (45 %) and IV (19 %). This means that 70 % of the resources allocated to MALs are directed towards those MALs that have a high productivity potential I if the biophysical and socioeconomic constraints are removed. Considering, however, that Q III MALs in which Centres operate include productive areas such as the cracking “black cotton” soils of India and eastern Africa, the poorly drained “inland valleys” of West Africa and the infertile “Cerrados” of Brazil, it could also be concluded that three quarters of CGIAR resources are being applied to increase the sustainable productivity of lands with high agroecological potential (Qs I-II, and tracts of Q III). Table 3 presents regional estimates on how resources are shared among CGIAR research activities within favourable and marginal lands. Given the opportunities for CGIAR’s research on the marginalized poor identified in Chapter 4, the 12 categories are clustered into four ad-hoc groups of activities addressing such opportunities. Activities on Biodiversity Conservation and Enhancement (grouping Act. 1 &z 7) represent resources allocated to improve biological alternatives, while those under Sustainable Production Systems (grouping Act. 2-6) address requirements for “intensification through diversification”. Policy activities (Act. 8) deal with institutional constraints, Collaboration with NARS (Act. 9-12) contribute to the requirement for new partnership mechanisms advocated in recommendations 3-4. As no information was provided by the Centres to indicate whether proportions among activities changed with regions and LGPs, estimates in Table 3 are based on the standard values across land types. This would explain why global activity shares remain essentially the same between land types. Should proportions be different at operational levels, shares of projects covering more than one agroecology would not represent actual resource allocation. The same picture appears to emerge from the regional data, the exception being that of WANA. Estimates for this region show a substantial increase in Biodiversity and Collaborative activities for research on MALs, while activities on Sustainable Systems and Policy decrease. Despite this, reflections on the preliminary analysis would suggest that current activity categories may not be sensitive enough to indicate actual resources allocated to alleviating constraints affecting poverty processes. Thus, activities in biodiversity enhancement to improve nutrient utilization by plants could be aimed at either nutrient-rich (FALs) or nutrient-poor lands (MALs). In the same vein, Sustainable Systems research could be aimed at increasing the long-term economic efficiency of monocropping enterprises, or at identifying opportunities for diversified systems. An assessment of CGIAR resources focused on the marginalized rural poor would require, therefore, information on the extent to which projects are explicitly targeted at poverty alleviation in MALs. An examination of the 374 projects endorsed for 1997 shows that only 92 projects appear to be targeted directly at poverty alleviation on MALs (25 %), and 37 of them are partially targeted (10%). Of the remaining 245 projects, 27 are targeted at poverty alleviation in FALs (7 %), and 218 projects are not explicitly targeted to poverty alleviation (58 %).

With the aim of achieving greater uniformity of terminology, the Report presented a six-celled matrix for evaluating land-related issues. This paper takes the principles, which the Marginal Lands Study adopted for its examination of the relation between marginal lands and rural poverty, and develops them as a conceptual framework for more-general use by the CGIAR in its priority setting. Land is defined as an area of the earth’s surface which comprises the major biophysical attributes that influence land use, including the atmosphere, soil, geology and hydrology, plant and animal populations, and the results of past and present human activity such as terracing, drainage and irrigation. The CGIAR has adopted the practice of setting its priorities and strategies according to the poverty weighted values of commodities and sectors, with allowance for important modifying factors such as those that influence the probability of success in research2. These principles could also be applied to prioritizing the System’s work on different types of land. Alston, Norton and Pardey have listed four efficiency criteria for estimating the expected benefits from commodity research programs: current value of production, maximum yield increase (or decrease prevented) if the research were successful, probability of research success, and the likely rate and extent of adoption of its results. The framework outlined in this paper would assist in assigning values to these criteria, so that potential benefits could be estimated for research on different categories of land. Information about the likely costs of such research would be needed for a prospective cost/benefit analysis. 1. Background In the Marginal Lands Report, the six-celled matrix was defined by the present value of land use on one axis, and on the other, the potential for enhancement of production through research. Three levels of present use value were identified: l high present use value - favoured agricultural lands, l low present use value - marginal agricultural lands, l lands at low or zero intensity of use. Two levels of potential to expand production based on research were identified, high and low. Figure 1 reproduces the table that was presented in the Marginal Lands Report. ’ TAC (1997a).

Issues in the Development of a Generalized Framework In developing these principles for more-general use by the CGIAR, TAC recognized the follo@ng issues. Firstly, in the real world there tends to be continuous variation from zero to high in both the present value of land use and the potential to enhance its productivity through research. While the six quadrants* are helpful in visualizing the characteristics of the different types of land, it is a matter of choice as to where the dividing lines are drawn. Secondly, the Marginal Lands Report defined the potential to expand production in terms of research only. While research is the primary interest of the CGIAR, there are arguments for preceding the analysis of research priorities with a review of the potential benefits from investments of all kinds. It may be that for well-known socioeconomic reasons (not needing further research) existing technologies are not being used to enhance the value of production. Alternatively, further research may be required to find out why apparently suitable technologies are not being used. Generally, two main sets of factors determine the scope for enhancement of value of land use through investment. Firstly, there are the biophysical attributes of soil, climate and terrain. Man-made physical capital, such as the provision of irrigation water and the terracing of steep slopes, also could be included here. Secondly, there are socioeconomic elements associated with (a) the creation, dissemination and utilization of knowledge, (b) access to inputs, markets and credit facilities, (c) output/input ratios, and (d) a group of motivational factors determined to a large extent by the incentives created by society and its economic, cultural and other institutions. In other words, and as developed more fully in the TAC Marginal Lands study, the actual realization of the potential for improvements in production or productivity depends on people having control over land (use rights), and specifically on their knowledge of what can and needs to be done; their access to the resources required to implement what needs to be done; and their incentives to do what needs to be done. Thirdly, the point needs to be made that the present productive value of any particular area of land depends greatly on what it is used for. Land that is too dry for cropping may be very profitable for grazing ruminant livestock. In more humid climates., terrain that is unsuitable for cultivation of annual crops may be well suited to perennial tree crops and forests. So there will be a different matrix for each type of land use in agriculture and forestry. Fourthly, it must be recognized that in practice the productivity of agricultural land can also be reduced. The use of land for agriculture sets in train a set of potentially degrading processes (a downward movement in Figure l), which have to be countered i,f value is not to be lost. While investment in research is usually thought of in the context of enhancing land value, it can also serve to prevent or reduce potential loss of value. During the past 150 years, agricultural research has continually expanded the opportunities for productivity enhancement, often far beyond the intrinsic value of the land for agriculture when it was first used for that purpose. However, the possibility that these l The terminology of the Marginal Lands Report has been adopted here. 3 inherent degrading processes will reduce the productive value of agricultural land has been of increasing global concern recently, under the rubric of sustainability. , Finally, there does not appear to be any strict logical relationship between lands at low or zero present intensity of use (for any particular form of agriculture or forestry) in quadrants 5 and 6 of Figure 1 and those in the other four quadrants of the matrix. Land that is available for future development, say grazing land with good potential for grain cropping, could in theory translate into any of quadrants 1 to 4 when developed for that purpose. 3. The Proposed Framework With these issues in mind, TAC proposes that the Group adopt a modified version of the scheme described in the Marginal Lands Report. The priority of any particular category of land would be rated by plotting its present productivity per unit area of land, against the potential for change through investment in research. This is equivalent to using quadrants 1 to 4 of Figure 1 without the dividing lines, and reversing the direction of the axis for potential to expand production. Another important change would be to define the X axis to include prevention of degradation, rather than enhancement of production only, as in Figure 1. This is consistent with sustainability reasoning, by allowing for investment in research that forestalls loss of productivity through land degradation. Land that is awaiting development would be classified into a single separate category, noting that in practice there is likely to be a spectrum of feasibility, from land that is available immediately using existing technologies and under existing investment conditions, through to land that would become attractive for development only after the discovery of new technologies or under the pressure of increased demand. Having a separate category of land awaiting development, instead of quadrants 5 and 6 set in a fixed relationship to the rest of Figure 1, allows newly-developed land to fall anywhere in the graph of productivity against potential returns from research. The location of any particular land type within the framework of Figure 2 is very likely to change with time. Implementation of improved technologies will move land from the bottom right of the figure towards the top left of it. Thus, the adoption of green revolution technologies in Asia over the period 1961 to 1990 lifted average rice yields from 1800 to 3700 kilograms a hectare4. In the process, the potential benefit from further investment in conventional agricultural research was sharply reduced, at least for those lands using the new technologies at levels close to their economic optima, and with the existing stock of basic knowledge. Some significant scientific breakthrough, say in yield potential or in resistance to pests, diseases or soil constraints, was then needed to move the most productive green revolution rice lands back towards the right hand side of Figure 2. Moreover, research to prevent degradation of such high-yielding lands may then have offered a more attractive investment than yield enhancing research. Generally, unchecked degradation will move lands ‘downwards in Figure 2, to the right for those kinds of degradation with good potential for reversal through research, to the left for those lacking that potential. 4 ’ Plucknett, D L (1993) Science and Agricultural Transformation. IFPRI Lecture Series No. 1. 4 4. How the Framework Might Be Used In order to use the efficiency criteria described by Alston, Norton (and Pardey, it is necessary to know the total area of each category of land as well as its current productivity per unit area. This permits current values of production to be calculated. The other three criteria, the maximum increase (or decrease forestalled) if the research were successful, the probability of such success, and the likely rate and extent of adoption, can all be factored into the potential benefits achievable through investment in research. One of the greatest difficulties in attempting to set agricultural research priorities objectively is the lack of reliable global data sets. In the case of agricultural land, reasonable data are likely to be obtainable on area and current productivity, but at present the potential change achievable through research can be estimated only on the basis of well informed judgement. Because of deficiencies in existing knowledge of values for the erfficiency criteria in research, in most cases it may be possible to agree only on the relative rankings of different types of land on the X axis, without it being possible to assign any exact values to them. Members of the CGIAR may find most value in assessments of the relative priorities of research on different classes of land within the mandated region of a single centre and the national systems with which it works. Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) would be one obvious basis of comparison. Another would be on political boundaries, because of the powerful influence of social and institutional factors on the implementation of new agricultural technologies. Also, the data permit poverty weightings to be made only for political boundaries at present. The following paragraphs offer some very preliminary suggestions of questions that would be worth asking about the priorities of different land types for prod-uction of annual grain crops, ruminant livestock and forests. In the case of croplands, one of the triggers for TAC’s review of the marginal lands issue was the perception by some people that they warranted a higher priority in CGIAR research than they had hitherto received. It is true that the major impact of green revolution cropping technologies has been in irrigated areas, and the possibility that some categories of rainfed land may now offer a higher rate of return on research deserves serious consideration. The highest immediate priority may be for socioeconomic research to under;stand better why the biophysical components of the very successful green revolution technologies have not been used to a greater extent on rainfed cropping lands. Government policies may be part of the answer. In developing countries, irrigated agriculture has generally been lsubsidized much more heavily than rainfed agriculture. The case for additional CGIAR crop and livestock research ‘to enhance the productivity of marginal lands is questionable. The information available to the Marginal Lands Review indicated that they had certainly not been neglected by the centres. Indeed, the Report argues strongly that the primary problem of poor people in low potential croplands is not technology as such, but deficiencies in the prevailing institutio:nal and policy arrangements. Concern about land degradation seems to have motivated much of the external interest in CGIAR research priorities for grazing lands used for ruminant livestock production. Although the very large area of grazed rangeland that is too dry for cropping or for growing improved forages does not support a large proportion of developing-country livestock or people, its research priority versus that of higher rainfall regions needs to be assessed objectively. Despite the pathetic appearance of arid grazing lands during prolonged drought, they can recover rapidly in subsequent periods of normal rainfall’. In the current state of knowledge, most experts would assess them as offering relatively low potential rates of return from investment in agricultural research. There is a significant area of land in sub-Saharan Africa awaiting development for ruminant livestock production, if the constraint of trypanosomiasis could be overcome. This category of land has, by implication, received a high priority in CGIAR investments. The chief question mark over current biotechnical research on trypanosomiasis has attached to its probability of success, not the priority of the associated land type. There has been very limited interest in comparisons of land types for ,tropical forestry. A far more important question is that of research priorities amongst alternative forms of land use within the same land type, notably in the remaining forests of the humid tropical lowlands. The framework of Figure 2 could be adapted to this purpose. Much of the land that was deforested in South America during the last two decades went into ruminant livestock production, whereas cropping and logging were the major causes of deforestation in Asia and sub-Saharan Af?ica6. The critical issue of prioritization is to estimate relative rates of return from research on the use of lowland rainforest for conservation of biodiversity plus production of non-wood products,- versus that from research on the use of the same land for logging, for forestry plantations, for tree crops (agroforestry), or for annual food crops. The challenge is to find common units of measurement that allow conservation of biodiversity to be plotted along with subsistence-and ollars on the value axis. . 5 de Haan, C, Steinfeld, H and Blackbum H (1997).

Definition, in each process, is driven largely by the perceptions of those analyzing the phenomena. Each group brings its own strong perceptions to bear. The lack of clear conceptualization, the observed heterogeneity and the diverse perceptions of those attempting the exercise complicate attempts at measurement. Statistical problems in the available measurements of each phenomenon, arising, among other things, from lack of representativeness, reduce the confidence that can be attached to extrapolations. Evaluating cause and effect with confidence implies, ideally, being able to observe the processes at different points in time for a large number of well-defined and relatively homogeneous situations. Such comparable observations are generally not available. In most cases the lack of adequate data and the complexity of the relationships that need to be modeled seriously limits rigorous empirical verification. Since a fuller understanding of the complex interaction of the two processes naturally leads on from a more comprehensive understanding of the individual processes, it too suffers from all the problems impeding a deeper understanding of each. The aggregate information available is not very useful for making judgments about poverty and land degradation. Evidence from the few available micro-level studies is mixed and often contradictory. IMost of the available technical literature relates to the controversy regarding the reasons for the adoption (or non-adoption) of conservation practices. This literature does not specifically address the behavior of the poor except through the cost implications of different conservation technologies and the incentive structures that influence adoption. Theoretical considerations are often cited as to why the poor can be expected to behave in ways that are land degrading. However, these considerations can generally apply just as well to the non-poor and can be explained by overall low levels of development. The pressures arising out of the processes of economic development that might induce people to degrade the land have be classified, in the literature, as those related to: increases in population; declines in common property resources; interest rate changes; and technology transfers. However, the literature also includes considerable theoretical and empirical evidence that indicates that the response to population pressures and market forces, in the long run, is an endogenous process of adaptation towards sustainable behavior. At the household level much more research, in a variety of settings over a reasonable length of time, is needed for a fuller understanding of decision-making processes, especially in terms of the relationship with land. Such research should ideally be built on detailed household-level longitudinal socioeconomic surveys with specific land use and iv quality assessment modules. Only then will it be possible to differentiate behavior by poverty status. The CGIAR is well placed to support such research. The CGIAR can also facilitate much greater interaction between the difYerent “actors” to bring realism where uninformed perceptions prevail, especially in the area of land degradation. Such interactions will lend much greater realism to the understanding of issues that have important implications for the present and future of humankind. These interactions shou!d naturally build on existing understanding, so as not to reinvent the wheel. The broad research agenda on poverty and land degradation can only be well defined after a reasonable period over which such understanding is established. Such research can only enhance the efforts within the CGIAR System on integrating commodity research with natural-resource management considerations. ‘This emphasis is properly placed and relevant. The CGIAR is a key forum for addressing the global dearth of knowledge about the implictitions of land degradation. A research agenda is needed that makes good use of the available information in order to better focus on poverty alleviation through the integration of commodity and natural-resource management research. Its relevance must be enhanced through the collection and use of more disaggregated information. I Rural Poverty and Land Degradation: A Reality Check for the CGIAR 1. . BACKGROUND Based on an in-depth evaluation of available information, the study on CGIAR Research Priorities on lMargina1 Lands’ concludes that neither the global and regional quantification of marginal land areas (based on biophysical data) nor the assessment of CGIAR projects and expenditures assignable to these various land areas are relevant to the CGIAR’s decision on strategy for poverty alleviation. The report states that the concept of “marginal areas” (MA) is more relevant.2 These are areas where “there are concentrations of marginal rural people and where the definition of geographic area would derive from a set of relatively homogeneous variables deemed to generate rural poverty. Biophysical characteristics would be one element in the equation” [Nelson et al. (1997)]. It thus put rural poverty at the center of the stage3. Within this overall sharper focus on the need to understand more fklly the causes and consequences of rural poverty with a view to identifying the options open to the System for addressing it; the report stated that “there is [also] a need to improve our understanding of land and water degradation processes.4 There appears to be little hard ’ This study had started with the “four tenets of conventional wisdom,” namely: 1)Marginal lands are defined in biophysical terms which establish them as: having low inherent productivity for agriculture; being susceptible to degradation; and involving high risks for agricultural production; 2)They support a high proportion of the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor; 3) The combination of.fiagility and high density of poor people who place a premium on current consumption (resulting in over-exploitation of natural resources) is leading to accelerated erosion or vegetation destruction; the consequence is a downward spiral of poverty and resource degradation with significant negative externalities; and, 4)The impact of CGIAR research on agricultural productivity increase, environmental protection and above all, poverty alleviation has been limited in these areas pelson et al. (1997)]. ’ Lack of comfort with the definition of marginal areas purely in terms of climate. soils and terrain was obvious for several years. For example, Crosson and Anderson (1993) had suggested an alternative definition based on productivity potential. Their discomfort had also extended to the allocation of research resources for such areas. From a purely economic point of view these authors had pointed out that research resources should only be allocated to marginal areas when concerns with equity in the distribution of productive opportunities outweighs productivity gains as the criterion for research focus amongst areas. This is basically a political choice and to the extent that cost free migration is an alternative, equity might be much better served by focusing on the areas with more productive potential and encouraging non agricultural activities in the less favored ones. Focusing on less favored areas may not be the most cost effective way to promote equity. ‘The report concludes that the assessment of the appropriate balance between CGIAR research investment targeted to hiA and to non-MA could only follow from a clarification of where marginal people are located, why they are marginal and the options open to the System for addressing poverty in the MA. 4 The widespread reports of land degradation in Africa; soil erosion on sloping lands in South Asia; and the extensive deforestation of agricultural landscapes in formerly forested parts of South Asia and Ethiopia have brought an increased focus on issues of natural resource management in agriculture [Scherr and 2 evidence linking the poor, in contrast to the non-poor, to accelerated resource degradation. Degradation processes need to be understood and linked to poverty processes” melson et al. (1997)]. By highlighting the lack of rigorous evidence and calling for a greater understanding of the interaction of the two processes, the Marginal Lands Study has called into question the strong perception that poverty is both a consequence as well as a cause of resource degradation.’ This perception is strongly evident in the writings of the multilateral development agencies such as the World Bank6 and the International Fund for Agricultural Development7 (IFAD). The present study is a first step towards addressing the concerns raised by Nelson et al. (1997) with regard to poverty and land degradation. In reviewing the available literature on rural poverty and land degradation and evaluating the implications of the current state of knowledge for priority setting in the CGIAR System; an attempt is made to look beyond the generally-held perceptions of poverty and land degradation processes. Such an effort is inherently fraught with all the problems that a study of the interaction of two complex and diverse processes is bound to face. These problems are further compounded by the fact that the understanding of these processes is still limited and shrouded in yadav (1995)]. Such statements aggregate over many diverse situations and lead to confusion. Generally societies are composed of poor as well as non-poor individuals and poverty is characterized by differential access to resources especially land. Stating that the poor in a particular region behave differently from the non-poor in terms of their relationship to land and are impacted differentially by it is not the-same as saying that generally low levels of development in a region are both a cause as well as a consequence of resource degradation. While areas with low levels of development may have a larger proportion of the poor. regions with relatively better levels of development can also contain significant proportions of poor people. In order to evaluate conciusively if the poor behave differently from the non-poor, it is crucial to be able to maintain conceptual and analytical rigor. For this it is important to control for general levels of development, institutions, markets, infrastructure, resource quality and quantity and relationships that govern the use of resources. 6 For example, “increasing numbers of poor people live in areas that have little ago-climatic potential and are environmentally fragile. .population pressure in these areas has decreased the productivity of land and increased its vulnerability to flooding and soil erosion. This raises the question of the links between poverty and environmental degradation. . . . . .These regions need a special development strategy for three reasons. First there potential for growth is limited. Second they are increasingly occupied by poor people with the fewest skills and the least access to infrastructure and supplies. Third environmental degradation in these regions adversely affects both the immediate area and regions downstream or downhill. .Poor farmers are being marginalized and pushed to frontier areas. In addition population growth and the commercialization of agriculture have forced farmers who once relied on environmentally sustainable forms of cultivation to use their land more intensively. . But the intensification of traditi.onal farming methods such as slash and burn agriculture has damaged the productivity of these marginal areas. Over grazing and unmanaged irrigation and an ever widening search for fuel wood all accelerate decline. . Insecure land tenure and encroachments on common and state lands encourage soil mining practices that diminish the long term productivity of the land [World Bank (1990)]. ’ For example, when peoples’ survival is at stake they are forced to farm increasingly marginal soils, to reduce fallow periods which would permit the soil to renew its fertility, to cut vital forests in their search for arable land or fuel and to overstock fragile range lands [IFAD (1992)]. 3 numerous unresolved issues ranging from difficulties in conceptualization and definition. to those of measurement and empirical verification. The lack of a clear testable theory on the interaction of the two processes and the vast heterogeneity of what is observed, coupled with the limited and inadequate range of what is actually measured of the numerous diverse elements of this interaction underlies these problems. There are numerous difficulties associated with definition, measurement and maintenance of analytical rigor. Attempts at rigorous analysis generally gloss over the underlying assumptions and the inherently weak statistical basis. The emotionalism associated with images of severely denuded hillsides or starving malnourished children tend to take over. The debate looses further clarity through the involvement of several intellectual disciplines that do not speak a common language. The short- and long- term implications of land degradation are not very clear [see Scherr and Yadav (19931.’ Similarly, while knowledge about poverty is expanding rapidly, thanks in large parts to the massive international focus and resources brought to bear on its understanding in the past ten years or so; the existing state of knowledge is still far from providing a comprehensive understanding of all the complex dimensions of its processes.g Even less clear and limited is the understanding of the interactions of poverty and land degradation. 10 This study is organized as follows: Initially the understanding on each process is evaluated. Issues connected with definition and measurement are highlighted and currently available empirical estimates are presented. Next the existing state of knowledge about the relationship between poverty and land degradation is evaluated. The empirical evidence and attempts to explain observed behavior are analyzed. The implications of the current understanding for policy research generally and for the CGIAR in particular are presented in the final section. ’ This study, part of the IFPRI 2020 exercise, presents the synthesis of discussions from a three-day workshop of 35 experts from 14 countries representing a cross section of disciplines. The discussions at this workshop were structured around four research paper prepared especially by IFPRI to address the land degradation and food production linkages namely 1) an extensive literature review comparing existing studies of the scale and effects of land degradation 2) a modeling exercise to simulate some of the effects of land degradation on global food production, trade and consumption [Agcaoili, Perez and Rosegrant (1995)], 3) a modeling exercise to simulate the process of land-use intensification in the drylands of the Sahel to 2020 [Barbier (1995)], and 4) a review of ecological principles and natural resource degradation and improvements, and microeconomic foundations for changes in land management in tropical hillsides, along with their implications for policy [Scherr, Jackson and Templeton (1995)]. ’ Conclusion of the World Bank’s workshop on the “Future Of Poverty Analysis In The Bank”, March 16, 1997 reported in Malik (1997). lo Studies on the direct empirical verification of the relationship between poverty and land degradation are extremely scarce. Scherr and Yadav (1995) after their comprehensive survey of available literature conclude that no consistent relationship between poverty and land degradation can be established. 4 1.1 Defining Land Degradation and Sustainability There are several definitions of land degradation. Land” degradation is generally defined as the reduction in the soil’s ability to contribute to crop production [Blaikie and Brookfield (1987)] and as a change to land that makes it less useful fclr human beings [Wasson (1987)]. Examples of land degradation can be found in erosion, salinization, waterlogging, vegetation depletion, fertility loss, soil structure change, #and pollution of soil. In each case the focus is on the physical or biological effects with land-use methods seen as the ultimate causes of degradation. Land degradation can take many forms.12 Land degradationI effects are often cumulative. The off-site effects (sedimentation of reservoirs and deposition of silt on downstream fields), both positive and negative, can also be considerable. A formidable problem exists because there is no simple relationship between the physical phenomena and the perceptions of land by human beings. What is observed in the present is the result of the interaction of several complex processes over long periods of time. For complete detection and measurement of land degradation, a system is needed for monitoring change in physical, biological and social phenomena. 14 The heterogeneity of the situations and the complex and changing (over time) interaction of the several processes involved have negative implications for precise measurement. I5 Concern with land degradation has heightened due to the increasing focus in policy circles on sustainability. There are several definitions in use for sustainability in * ’ The concept of land used in such studies is broad. It is the extensive system of physical and biological materials and processes associated with the interface of the solid earth, terrestrial water bodies and the $r, and the works of human beings [Chisholm and Dumsday (1987)]. Scherr (1998) classifies these to include: crusting, compaction, sealing, wind erosion, water erosion, devegetation, over-tillage, impeded drainage, waterlogging, reduced waterholding capacity, reduced infiltration, salinization, alkalinization, acidification, nutrient leaching, removal of organic matter, burning of vegetative residues, nutrient depletion, over-application of agrochemicals, industrial contamination, decline in vegetative cover, decline in biodiversity, decline in species composition, decline in availability of valued species. Land degradation involves aspects of physical soil management soil Water management, soil nutrient and organic matter management, soil biology management, vegetation management. 13 Degradation and erosion are not the same although the terms are often used interchangeably. Erosion is only one (though probably the most well known and significant) possible form of degraclation [Pagiola $;994)1. For an excellent discussion of detection and measurement issues of land degradation processes see Wasson (1987). ” Much of what we know about the extent and nature of land degradation is based on 1) anecdotal evidence 2) suspended sediment measurements and 3) plot-level soil loss measurements. The anecdotal evidence, though generally visually spectacular, is often non-representative and does not control for the effects of other factors. The suspended sediment measurements are difficult to undertake and do not provide information on the effects on yields. The plot-level soil-loss measurements come from test plots. There are also serious issues of the representativeness of field conditions and practices associated with these. Measurements are generally carried out in short periods - whereas actual soil loss varies substantially because of changes in other conditions. What are needed ideally are estimalres of long-term average loss. Moreover, these measurements are generally limited to soil loss and not productivity loss. These measurements generally assume that soil moved from one field is soil lost, whereas it might have moved from one field to another. Because of these data problems often it is very difficult to decide on the existence or severity of land degradation [Pagiola (1994)]. 5 agriculture which leads to some confusion There is a need for a clear and widely agreed upon perspective. I6 Existing definitions can be broad and all encompassing. For example sustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs [The World Commission on Environment and Development17 (1987)]. Sustainable development means more efficient use of arable lands and water supplies. It requires avoiding overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides so that they do not degrade rivers and lakes, threaten wildlife and contaminate human food and water supplies. It means careful use of irrigation to avoid salinization or water logging of croplands. It means avoiding the expansion of agriculture to steep hillsides or marginal soils that wo.uld rapidly erode [World Resources Institute (1982)]. Sustainability is often confused to imply zero depletion of the natural resource base or zero environmental costs. However, as Crosson and Anderson (1993) point out “agricultural production that imposes some resource depletion and environmental costs can be sustainable as long as the costs of depletion and environmental damage are consistent with rising per capita welfare”. From an economic perspective, degradation only occurs beyond the socially defined optimal use level. Such degradation occurs where individuals cannot or do not optimize returns to their resources (e.g., due to inadequate information) and/or because there is a’ divergence between private and social interests (e.g., externalities or inappropriate public policies) [see for example Scherr and Yadav (1995) and Binswanger (1989)]. This lack of an agreed .persgective on sustainability has implications for how land’ degradation is defined, measured and analyzed There is general recognition that data.on the physica! .processes of land degradation as well as on its economic and social consequences are sparse [Scherr and Yadav (1995)]. Earlier reviews of the evidence on land degradation around the world have also found this evidence to be “extraordinarily skimpy.” “ No country has comprehensive estimates of the productivity consequences of land degradation or the rates of degradation from current practices” [Crosson and Anderson (1992)]. S everal other authors, including Biot et al. (1995), recognizing this inadequacy, have called for a thorough review of experimental and field data and a sharper focus, particularly, on robust and cheap methods of measurement in order to improve the understanding of the physical processes involved. The problems associated with drawing representative samples for plot-level measurement have meant that most aggregate es&mates are based on non-scientific methods of “raising” the information. Most estimates of the imptict of: land degradation are based on I6 The lack of an agreed perspective is brought out forcefully in the discussion on conceptual issues’relating to sustainable growth of agriculture by Crosson and Anderson (1993). Given the increasing concern with the potentjal impact on the welfare of current and, in particular, future generations, the need for an agreed perspective for identifying measures that can guide analysis of policies, approaches, and achievements in the field of poverty, natural resources, and the environment is obvious. ” Generally referred to as The Brundtland Commissicg 6 “objective assessments” by experts. Available aggregate estimates of the cost of degradation have to be taken with even greater caution since they are based on standard formulas relating certain levels of degradation to estimates of yield losses. Attempts to go from the estimates of the effect of yield losses at the plot level to aggrega.te estimates of the socioeconomic impact at the national or regional level have often been dubbed as “giant leaps of faith.” Even at the plot level the problems associated with measuring the physical and social value consequences of alternative natural resource management practices and technologies are “big and complex” and not amenable to perfect solutions [Crosson and Anderson (1993)]. The inadequate basis of the available numbers is, however, generally lost in the emotionalism that pronouncements of the catastrophic extent of land degradation generally stir up. Statements such as “over the last thirty years alone, the world has lost nearly one fifth of the top soil from its crop land, one fifth of its tropical rainforests and tens of thousands of plant and animal species” [Brown (1990)] stir up visions of imminent and impending doom. The literature associated with the “tragedy of the Commons” [Hardin (1968)] h as brought an increasing focus on the negative consequences of the interaction of man and natural resources. Is On the other hand complacency, I9 based upon the phenomenal increase in agricultural (especially food) production during the past forty years or so, might well be misplaced. There is thus a tremendous need to obtain a fuller understanding of the different aspects of soil degradation based on data generated through consistent definitions and scientific rigor. As already noted, the studies of the impact of soil degradation are based, in one crucial aspect or the other, on the assessments of experts. In most countries the data used for such estimates generally comes from a few studies that were not originally designed to generate estimates for the whole country.” Moreover, the capacity to monitor changes over time is limited by the weak statistical foundations and the lack of comparability in the available data. Attempts are being made to address some of these concerns through research on land quality indicators [World Bank (1997)]. The land quality indicators (LQI) program2’ was l8 The Hardin study had brought the focus to bear on the tragedy of the global commons. The issues of land degradation relate more to local commons, I9 This complacency has been likened by some to the misconception of the man hurtling headfirst from the top of a twenty story building stating merrily, as he falls past the ninth floor, that there is nothing serious to worry about because nothing has happened yet! The influential FAO study World Agricuhure Towmds 2010 reflects this complacency ori an aggregate level [Alexandratos (19931. It does, however, highlight the seriousness of the problem in certain regions. ” For example U.S estimates of the.magnitude of soil erosion and the effects of soil erosion on land 2P:oductivit-y come from only two sample surveys [Crosson (1986)]. This program involves agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The World Resources Institute, the International Food Policy Research Institute. and other CGIAR institutions are also participating. 7 set up under a coalition of international agencies in 1994. Its objective was to better understand the problems of land degradation. This program seeks to “develop a set of natural resource indicators: statistics or measures that help characterize the conditions of natural resources related to land. The program seeks to develop a set of standardized indicators (mainly focused on the local and district levels) to provide concise, reliable information about the condition of land, including the combined resources of soil, water, vegetation and terrain that provide the basis for land use” [Pieri et al. (19951. The Global Land Assessment of Degradation (GLASOD22) is the first major exercise that has sought to maintain some consistency in definitions in its endeavor to obtain aggregate estimates of land degradation [Oldeman, Hakkeling and Sombroek (1990)]. The comparative study of dry lands by Dregne and Chou (1992) represents another important effort.23 While the GLASOD exercise was designed to study the problem at the continental scale, the latter study was designed for analysis at the national level but was limited by the availability of national studies. The study [ASSOD] by van Lynden and Oldeman (1997) represents a recent attempt at estimating land degradation. While the methodology is basically the same as that for the GLASOD study, it permits analysis at the national level while the GLASOD was focused on a larger regional level. The GLASOD study estimated that nearly 2 billion hectares of the 8.7 billion hectares of vegetated area (agricultural land, pasture, forest and woodland) (22.5 percent) have been degraded since the mid century. This study estimated that some 3.5 percent of the total have been degraded so severely as to be reversible only through costly engineering measures if at all. Just over 10 percent has been moderately degraded and is reversible only through significant on-farm investments. Another nearly 9 percent is lightly degraded and easily reversible through good land management. The GLASOD estimates indicate that nearly one-half of this vegezated area is under forest, of which about 18 percent is degraded; 3.2 billion hectares is under pasture, of which 21 percent is degraded and nearly 1.5 billion hectares is in cropland, of which 38 percent is degraded. Water erosion is the principal cause of degradation. Wind erosion is an important cause, particularly in dry lands and areas where land forms are conducive to high winds. ” The GLASOD estimates are also subjective because these are based on experts’ estimation of land degradation since the Second World War. ” Studies listed in Scherr (1998) by methods used for assessment of soil degradation impacts include: Qualitative assessments: Pagiola and Dixon (1997), Oldeman et al. (199 l), van Lynden and Oldeman (1997), Seghal and Abrol (1994) and Dregne (1990, 1992). Biophysical models of degradation-yield relationships: Aune et al. (1997); Kilasara et al. (1995); Stocking and Benites (1996), Ca$sman et al. (1995) with secondary price data to obtain estimates of value: Aune (1995), Pagiola (1997), Littleboy et al. (1996). Aggregate, gross valuation of economic losses due to degradation and cost benefit analysis: Pimentel (1995),Yourig (1993), Lutz et al. (1994), McIntire ( 1994), White and Jickling (1994). Econometric models: Byringiro and Reardon (1996), Rozelle et al. (1997), Lindert (1996), Bojo (1991), Rozelle et al. (1997), Byringiro and Reardon (1997), Alfsen et al. (1997), Agcaoli et al. (1995), Higgins et al. (1983). Comprehensive Assessments based on disaggregated data (by soil type, farming system, crop): Stoorvogel et al. (1993), Smaling and Stoorvogel(l993), Repetto et al. (1989), La1 (1995) 8 Figure 1. ~-and degradation by type of lancl use: A regional perspective (million hectares) 1,400 ! m Degraded Land %%@ Nonddgraded I-and/ Source: Scherr and Yadav (1995) based on GLASOD estirrratea. Chemical degradation, such as salinization and nutrient loss, is. often the result of cropping practices. It accounts for a smaller overall proportion of degraded lands but more than 40 percent of cropland degradation. Physical degradation such as compaction accounts for a smaller proportion of degraded area. According to the GLASOD estimates degradation of cropland appears to be most extensive in Africa, affecting 65 percent of cropland area compared with 5 1 percent in Latin America and 38 percent in Asia. Degradation of pasture is also most extensive in Africa, affecting 3 1 percent, compared with 20 percent in Asia and 14 percent in Latin America. Forest land degradation is most extensive in Asia, affecting 27 p.ercent of forest land compared with 19 percent in Africa and 14 percent in Latin America [GLASOD estimates reported by Scherr (I. 998)]. Land degradation can lead to declining potential yields on the farm. But, fertilizer use or changing the land use can hide the effects of this degradation for long periods. As such it is almost impossible to establish a one-to-one relationship between the amount of degradation and the effect on yields. Moreover, the level at which yields iare affected by changes in land quality can differ by the type and variety of crop grown and by type of soil and its depth etc. While measurements of land degradation generally cover only a short peGod of time, any measurable effect on crop yields could however, take long periods to appear because of the cumulative nature of land degradation. . 9 For developing countries the literature on land degradation is even more qualitative and less rigorous than that available for developed countries. The difficulty of modeling complex farming systems and the lack of necessary data both contribute to this paucity.24 Most glaring is the lack of knowledge of the effects of degradation on social welfare. “Most of the technical literature on the socioeconomic aspects of land degradation can be classified into three broad categories: soil conservation as an input in agricultural production; top soil as a natural resource, somewhere between nonrenewabIe and renewable; and the effects of land degradation on common property resources and externalities” [Anderson and Thampapillai (199O)J. Studies at the household level that attempt to rigorously verify differences in behavior between the poor and the non-poor with respect to land are generally difficult to find. This paucity results in large part from the inadequacy of the available data.‘5 Given some of the problems described above, there is an urgent need for a research agenda that builds up from a large number of case studies. In order to ensure common perspectives, such a research program should involve the biophysical scientists, the socioeconomic experts and the land users working closely together. Use of consistently defined household-level socioeconomic panel (longitudinal) surveys that have specific land-quality assessment modules in several of the “hot spots26” could provide effective answers. ” Such surveys would also be extremely useful for studying the dynamics of poverty. Most of the available literature looks at the impact of land degradation in terms of crop production. Scherr (1998), based on her detailed review of this literature,** concludes that “many studies examine the gross impact of degradation on crop production ” [but] very 24 The lack of technical information such as rates of soil loss and physical parameters such as those required for the definition of the universal soil loss equation (USLE) leads some studies to use site parameters from specific developed country locations [see for example Veloz et al. (1985)]. ” Careful analysis requires disaggregated and detailed data. The availability of disaggregated data on population, incidence of poverty, land use and infrastructure is essential for rigorous analysis. Such data for India enabled Fan and Hazel1 (1997) to show that public investments in less favored rainfed areas, [coupled with high-yielding varieties, irrigation and education] would increase agricultural productivity and reduce rural poverty. And, that the resultant gain per unit of additional investment would be higher than similar investments in irrigated or high potential rain fed areas. Similarly, a study using the detailed 1992 -93 World Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey data for Viemam found that the highest impact on net crop income would occur in Vietnam’s two poorest regions: the Northern Uplands and the North Coast [van de Walle (1996)]. 26 Th ese “hot spots” in land degradation based on the recent assessment of an international group of experts are presented in Annex 1. 27 The IFPRI Pakistan panel survey of rural households collected information on land quality in 1993. However, this information, has not been analyzed to date. ” Scherr (1998) contains the most comprehensive review of studies showing the impact of land degradation.’ At the global level she reviews UNCOD (1977), UNEP (1980), Higgins et al. (1983), Harrison (1984), Mabbutt (1987), Buringh and Dudal (1987), Dregne and Chou (1992), Oldeman et al. ( 1992), Pimentel et al. (1993), Steiner and Herdt (1993), Crosson (1994), Agcaoli et al. (1995), Dyson ( 1996), Stocking and Benites (1996), Crosson (1997) and Scherr and Yadav (1995) lg Oodit and Somonis (1992) estimated that salinity has reduced the yield of major crops by 30 percent in 10 few examine the net effect, taking into account price effect, substitution of supply by other producing areas, or other secondary impacts. [And moreover] vex-y few studies incorporate into their analysis any active farmer response to degradation” [Scherr (1998)‘J. S&err could find only three studies that provided data relevant to the iassessment of human welfare impacts. These welfare assessments use different indicators to assess the impact at national or international levels.jO A detailed review of the results and methodological aspects of these studies is available in Scherr (1998) and is therefore not attempted here. However, results from the IFPRI simulations reported by her are reproduced below. Simulations based on the global food production and trade model developed at 1FPR.I under different scenarios for degradation indicate that by the year 2020 an additional seven to nine million children will be malnourished under the assumptilons of severe degradation. The baseline estimate from this model is two hundred and six million malnourished children (so that this would imply approximately one to three percent increases in the baseline). The results indicate that land degradation may not be as severe a problem during the next two decades or so, as many believe. According to the simulations, a decline in investment in agricultural research and infra.structure can produce downturns of a similar magnitude. These results highlight another problem of some concern; while the global picture may not be as bleak, the regional effect of land degradation can be expected to be quite severe in some countries, for example China and Pakistan. 1.2 Classifying the Approaches to Land Degradation . Biot et al. (1995) have classified the main approaches to land degradation into three groups. These they term as: the classic; the populist revolution that shares characteristics with the neo-Marxist or world systems diagnosis of problems of land degradation and the neo-liberal counter revolution embodied in the approach taken by the World Bank. The main characteristics of the three approaches as summarized by Biot et al. (1995) are presented below: the fifteen million hectares of irrigated lands in Pakistan. The study by Crosson (1995) indicates that the average productivity losses in the dry lands between 1945 and 1990 were in the range of 11.9 to 13.4 percent. Globally he calculates that if all strongIy and extremely degraded lands were restored there would be a 15 percent yield increase. Given the spectacular growth in global food production and the secular declines in grain prices over this period it is obvious that other factors must have compensated for the effects of degradation on aggregate performance. j” The CGE model for Nicaragua, one of these three studies, finds a counter-intuitive positive effect of degradation on peasant consumption [Alfsen et al. (1996) reported in Scherr (1998)]. Variable Structural causes of land degradation Immediate Causes 11 Main Approaches to Land degradation Classic Populist over-population, resource distribution, backwardness, lack of inappropriate technol- foresight, ignorance ogies mis-management by users Academic discipline; profession science; bureaucratic Research framework Technology systematic empiricism soil conservation works particularly terracing Peasant behavior ignorant, irrational traditional Diagnosis of problem environmental solution mis-management by State, capitalists, TNCs big business sociology; activist Rapid/Participant rural appraisal, community as unit of analysis agronomic techniques of conservation virtuous, rational community minded socio-political solution Neo-liberal inappropriate property rights institutions, prices and rapid populn. Growth poor government policies and bureaucratic rules and regulns economics; development professional methodological individualism not specified rational, egocentric economic solution Source: Biot et al. (1995) The authors find that these approaches are neither sequential nor mutually exclusive. The present emphasis on poverty as both a cause and an effect of environmental degradation is shared by both the neo-Marxist and the neo-liberal approaches. Concern with the issue of population pressures on natural resources which was a popular theme of the classic approach has also re-emerged in the neo-liberal counter revolution literature. These approaches differ basically in terms of the role of the State and in their emphasis on the structural and immediate causes of land degradation. They also differ in terms of the assumptions regarding peasant behavior and in the diagnosis of the problem. This classification emphasizes the perceptual nature of the problem identification and underscores the inability of the available innovations to address the issue. Biot et al. (1995) state the basic dilemma as follows: “Land degradation is perceived to be a 12 problem, there are perceived to be many technological and institutional innovations that can solve them and these have been promoted by aid organizations - ;and yet these innovations seem not generally successful. Why?” Answers to this dilemma lie in getting to the reality behind these perceptions to develop common perspectives. Detailed evaluation of the factors underlying these perceptions. should bring together all the actors; the international and national research systems - biophysical and social scientists, the donor/development agencies, governments at levels and those who eke out a living from the land in the diverse situations around world. the all the 1.3 Defining Poverty Poverty is increasingly viewed as a multidimensional concept. It ha.s social and psychological effects that prevent people from realizing their potential [IFAD (1992)]. Measurement of poverty can include material deprivation, isoIation, alienation, dependence, and lack of participation or freedom of choice of assets, vulnerability and insecurity.” Introducing several such dimensions can seriously complicate the measurement problems. That is why most measurement is based on material deprivation” generally linked to the inability of incomes to meet basic nutritional demands. Poverty is, thus, operationally defined as the inability to attain a minimal standard of living.” Generally a consumption-based3’ poverty line is used and estimates are made of the head count index, the poverty gap ratio and a severity of poverty index.j’ The World 31 Isolation is defined in terms of lack of physical access to roads and mass communication. Alienation can be both functional and educational. Domination and dependence arise from tenurial relations. Agricultural families that are tenants and sharecroppers can be dominated by and be dependent on rural .elites. Lack of participation in decisions involving their own well being result from the rural poor seldom belonging to formal groups or organizations. Lack of assets both physical and social, and vulnerability are important characteristics of the poor. There are several inter-linked socioeconomic processes that both create and perpetuate rural poverty. Amongst these, policy-induced processes that have a bias, which excludes the rural poor from the benefits of development generally, accentuate the impact of other poverty processes. Dualism as an important poverty perpetuating process. In most ex-colonial societies small a.nd marginal farmers are hurt because resources starting with the best land are pre-empted by large, primarily export- oriented commercial farms [IFAD (1992)]. ” Material deprivation can be reflected in serious protein and energy malnutrition. However, the evidence is mixed on the relationship between levels of poverty and levels of malnutrition. Studies in Pakistan find high levels of malnutrition amongst children whereas corresponding levels of poverty in other countries do ;t display the same levels of malnutrition [Malik and Malik (1992)]. Three questions are relevant to operationalizing this definition: How to measure the standard of living? What is meant by a minimal standard of living? And having thus identified the poor how to express the ;Frall severity of poverty in a single measure or index? [Lipton and van der Gaag (1993)] Expenditures are found to be better measures of welfare than incomes especially at the lower ends of the income distribution because these reflect the household’s ability to borrow to smooth c.onsumption. j5 The Forster-Greer-Thorbecke (1984) class of decomposable indices which are generally used as measures of poverty are presented in Annex 2. 13 Bank supplements the consumption-based poverty measure with others such as nutritional status, life expectancy, under five mortality and school enrollment rates in what it terms the Priority Poverty Indicators36 (PPIs). The World Bank is currently considered to be the largest repository of information on poverty in the world37. The research work at the Bank has confirmed that, in order to answer the question of how the poor have participated in the general improvements, it is necessary to move from aggregate data to more disaggregated survey-based household-level data. Without such disaggregated data it is impossible to conduct rigorous analysis of the decision-making processes of poor households?. Poverty measurement is difficult at the national level and even more so at the sub- national and household levels. The quality and reliability of the data, where available, are generally questionable. Census taking is generally in its infancy in developing countries. Increasing attention is only now being paid to the systematic collection of socioeconomic information through household representative income and expenditure surveys. The heavy costs involved generally imply that the data that such surveys yield are only representative at the national or at most sub-national level. Given the nature and distribution of poverty, such aggregate estimates can often be misleading. The ability to match the quantitative information with more qualitative data is generally severely limited by the even greater scarcity of the latter. Even where such information is available, meaningful integration is limited because these come from entirely different samples and have generally been collected for entirely different purposes. The problems of the reliability and non-availability of the basic information are compounded by problems associated in the measurement. The use of one cut-off point or poverty line for the country as a whole aggregates across tremendous heterogeneity and does not necessarily reflect the particular situation in a sub-region or segment. The use of a standard calorie requirement cutoff so fashionable in previous studies, for example, masked tremendous differences in minimum calorie requirements across regions due to ‘G Non-income measures of welfare can include anthropometric measurement especially of vulnerable groups such as children under the ages of five and pregnant and lactating mothers. The World Bank augments these direct income and non-income measures of poverty with information on socioeconomic aggregates that indicate for example the access to social services. Access to social services denote the “public” incomes that the poor enjoy from the provision of health, education and other services that governments provide; consumption of which generally does not show up in household surveys. The Living Standards Measurement Surveys LSMS of the World Bank are especially designed to measure such access in addition to the other information that is generally required for computing the poverty measures. Moreover, the LSMS provide an element of consistency in the information that is available. However, these LSMS surveys generally require enormous resources, which restrict the ability of the developing countries to institutionalize them. The lack of such institutionalization implies that the information is sparse. There are very few countries for which comparable data are available over time. ” The World Bank has mandated that detailed poverty assessments be undertaken for all its client countries. In 1990 such assessments were available for eleven countries, which together accounted for forty percent of the total population of the developing world and for fifty percent of the poor. The older surveys were less reliable than the more recent ones. The World Bank first began conducting poverty assessments in 1989. Since then a total of eighty-four (seventy-five countries and nine updates) assessments have been completed covering approximately ninety percent of the world’s poor. ” Especially as these relate to the relationship with land. 14 differences in body structures, climate and level.? of physical activity.” In the case of estimates of rural poverty, for example, such estimates generally ignored incomes in kind from home production and to that extent may have been significantly biased upwards. While considerable headway has been made at improving the quality of the aggregate poverty information there is still considerable variability in quality.40 This variability was confirmed by a recent report of the Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank (1996).4* And while considerable headway has been made in counting the poor, considerably less has been done to explain why they are poor and in particular to explain what strategies for poverty alleviation work and why? While the need to move towards more disaggregated data and analysis is keenly felt there is no hard evid.ence available that shows that the poor as opposed to the non-poor behave differently in k.ey aspects and especially in terms of natural resource management. The data available are generally at levels of aggregation that limit their usefulness for analysis of specific land degradation problems that generally have a locational dimension. The PPIs are avaiiable at the national level for the countries for which these have been collected. This limits the usefulness for understanding specific processes related to poverty and the relationship to other processes such as land degradation. IFAD (1992) identifies five types of rural poverty. Material deprivation and alienation cause interstitial poverty, or pockets of poverty surrounded by power, affluence and ownership of assets. Material deprivation can combine with isolation and alienation to lead to peripheral poverty, which is) according to this study, found in the rnarginal areas. Material deprivation arising from population pressure and limits on resources will breed alienation and overcrowding poverty. Vulnerability to natural calamities, (e.g., drought) labor displacement, and insecurity, produces traumatic or sporadic poverty, which can be transitory but often ends up being endemic. Isolation, alienation, technological deprivation, dependence and lack of assets are also signs of endemic poverty. ” The use of the parity adjusted expenditure of $l/day/person, currently in vogue at the PJorld Bank, has its own limitations [see Ravallion (1994, 1992)]. JO Poverty profiles answer the questions such as where are the poor? Who are the poor? Why are they poor? And is it transitory or chronic poverty? why are they poor? A poverty profile is a simply instrument for making poverty comparison. These can show how poverty varies across sub groups of society, such as region of residence or sector of employment. A poverty profile can be extremely useful in accessing how the sectoral or regional pattern of economic change is likely to affect aggregate poverty. If the poverty profile shows that, for example, there is significantly more poverty in the rural farm sector than the non farm sector then a policy reform which improves farmers terms of trade is very likely to reduce aggregate poverty [ KFbur (1987, 1990)]. ” Only 54% of the 46 poverty assessments evaluated in this study met with the requirements. Most were five years old and some were based on data that were more than ten years old. The report used the following bench-marks for evaluation: 1) inclusion of a profile of Priority Poverty Indicators (PPIs) 2) diagnosis of poverty 3) set of prescriptions for poverty reduction and 4) operational content of the prescription. This classification is important for linking the types of poverty processes to the types of poverty produced and the segments of the population affected:“* According to the IFAD (1992) study, environmental degradation leads to both transitory and chronic poverty (IFAD terms these as peripheral and endemic poverty) and affects smallholders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisanal fishermen, refugees and households headed by women. The IFAD study contains an extensive classification of different types of poverty processes, the type of poverty that is produced, and the segments of the rural population affected by these, for 42 of the least developed countries. While this classification is helpful. , given the nature of the data on which it is based, it is only indicative of the types of aggregate patterns. Given the heterogeneity of types that it indicates and the extremely aggregate available data that it marshals the study does not help in rigorously answering specific questions or in furthering the understanding of the interaction of the poverty and land degradation processes. This IFAD (1992) study remains to date the most extensive analysis of its kind available in the literature on rural poverty. Based on information for the late 195Os, this study estimated that over 80 percent of the poor people in the 114 countries for which it analyzed available data were based in the rural areas. In the 42 least developed countries, the study found that as much as 69 percent of the total rural population lives in poverty. This figure was 3 1 percent for Asia, (46 percent if China and India are excluded), 60 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. 61 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and 26 percent in the Near East and North Africa. In absolute terms these percentages translate to 633 million in Asia, 204 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 27 million in the Near East and North Africa and 76 million in Latin America and the Caribbean. Substantial improvement in aggregate global welfare has been achieved over the past few decades. For example, between 1965 and 1990, world food production grew by 90 percent43 while population rose by 60 percent. This growth has, howetier, not been ” This full classification assumes that the international processes produce traumatic/sporadic poverty which affects small holders, refugees, and households headed by women. Domestic policy biases produce interstitial, peripheral, overcrowding, traumatic/sporadic and endemic poverty these processes affect small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artesinal fishermen, refugees and households headed by women. Dualism produces interstitial and peripheral poverty and affects small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisanal fishermen, refugees and households headed by women. Population pressure leads to peripheral and over crowding types of poverty. It affects smallholders, landless, nomadic pastoralists and households headed by women. Environmental degradation leads to peripheral and endemic poverty and affects small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisinal fishermen, refugees and household headed by women. Natural cycles produce peripheral, traumatic/sporadic and endemic poverty and affect small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisinal fishermen, refugees and households headed by women. Gender biases lead to endemic poverty and affect households headed by women. Cultural/ethnic biases produce interstitial and endemic poverty and affect ethnic groups exploitative intermediation produces interstitial, peripheral and endemic poverty and’affects small holders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, artisinal fishermen and women. Internal civil strife leads to traumatic/sporadic poverty and affects smallholders, landless, nomadic pastoralists, ethnic groups, refugees and women [IFAD (1992)]. ” The growth in agricultural production has resulted from the expansion of the agricultural systems; use of chemical fertilizers;pesticides, tools and machinery; improved seeds; and, land-improving investments 16 uniformly distributed.44 The increase in food production has resulted largely from yield increases. It is estimated that 93 percent of the incremental cereal output is due to intensification alone. Area expansion remains important in Africa and Latin America accounting for 40 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of cereal production increases over this period [Mink (1993)]. Average consumption per capita in developing countries has also increased by about 70 percent in real terms; average life expectancy has risen from 51 to 63 years; and primary school enrollment rates have reached 89 percent. If these gains-were evenly distributed, much of the world’s poverty would be eliminated. The lack of comparable estiiates of poverty over time makes it difficult to evaluate trends. However, based on heroic attempts to obtain comparable and consistent data sets, the consensus appears to be that growth, even when it is associated with rising inequality, has led to poverty reduction [Fields (1980), World Bank (1990, chapter 3) and Squire (1993)]. Ravallion and Datt (1994) estimate that the historical elasticity of the poverty head count measure to mean consumption is about minus 1.5 for India. Bell and Rich (1994) estimate that the rural poverty head count responds to real agricultural output per head, with an elasticity of minus 1.5 to minus 0.8, depending on model specification. Nearly all avaiIable studies agree that agricultural growth (especially growth and stabilization of food staples production) is likely to benefit poor people.J’ There is some evidence to indicate that the level of initial inequality of incomes and of assets determines the degree to which growth is translated to reduction in poverty [Lipton and Ravallion (1995)]. The evidence on the relationship of growth to inequality is however, mixed. The World Bank Policy Research Department has an active program focusing on establishing consistent patterns in the relationship between growth, inequality and poverty. Deininger and Squire (1996) and Ravallion and Chen (1997) present results based on household data sets for a number of countries. While these “new” household data sets represent improvements in quality and coverage it is important to bear in mind the differences in definitions in the underlying data sets on which these estimates are based. While the authors do consistently warn users to keep such inadequacies in mind, it is easy to loose sight of these warnings and focus only on the aggregate results that are brought out. Mindful of the limitations such as the lack of tests for sensitivity and robustness and the large number of factors identified by the authors that could affect cross country comparisons, the study by Deininger and Squire (1996) could find. no systematic link between growth and changes in inequality. The study found, however, a strong positive relationship between growth and reduction in poverty. A later study by Ravallion and Chen (1997) uses a larger number of household surveys to define “spells” from 67 particularly irrigation and drainage. U In Sub-Saharan Africa cereal production increased by only 60 percent while population increased by 105 percent. ” Some examples where agricultural growth is not necessarily pro-poor also exist [see Cohen (1975)]. However, the general experience is that agricultural growth works in several ways to improve the welfare of the poor. Its large direct and indirect multipliers on income and employment open up avenues for the poor to participate in the growth process. 17 countries between 198 1 and 1994 to conclude that changes in inequality and polarization were uncorrelated with changes in average living standards. The results of the relationship between inequality and growth were at best mixed. However, “almost always poverty fell with growth in average living standards and rose with contraction” [Ravallion and Chen (1997)]. The relationship of poverty and land is intimate, given the prevalence of poverty in rural areas. Countries that are classified as low income have much higher shares of agriculture in GDP and even higher shares of rural labor force as compared to the industrial market economies [World Bank (1990)]. Typically, the share of agriculture. in gross domestic product in the low-income countries is about 30 percent while the proportion of total labor force in agriculture is about 68 percent. The corresponding figures for the industrial market economies are 6 and 2 percent, respectively [World Bank (1997)]. Quibria and Srinivasan (1991), in a comparative study of seven Asian developing countries in the late 198Os, showed that rural poor depended more on agriculture than the rural non-poor did. This has also been observed in West Africa [Reardon et al. (1992)]. The welfare of rural non-farm households also depends substantially on the forward and backward production and consumption linkages from fanners [Chuta and Liedholm (1981), Hazel1 and Haggblade (1993) and Hazel1 and Ramasamy (1991)]. “Given the high labor intensity and relevance to, local food availability and prices of agricultural products most anti-rural-poverty strategies for production activities are based subStantially on agriculture” [Lipton and Ravallion (1995)]. The lack of land and rural povkrty are generally observed t? coexist [Ravallion and Sen (1994)]. Generally three forms of interventions are suggested to improve the access of the poor to land [IFAD (1992)]. These are’redistribution ofpwnership rights, regulation of tenancy contracts and the role of land titling.“6 Improved equity and efficiency are generally put forward as justifications for land redistribution. Operationally, the implementation of such programs has been strongly affected by political realities. Redistribution implies increasing intensification with possible negative consequences for land degradation. At the same time, redistribution iS expected to improve access to credit so necessary for the use of inputs. This can facilitate investments in land-improving and maintaining technologies. . Tenancy reforms are also advocated on the basis of equity and efficiency. Such reform can however, also increase landlessness through large-scale eviction as evidenced in South Asia. And within the different forms of tenancy arrangements, a move away from share cropping arrangements can imply a reduction in traditional risk sharirig arrangements with Qotential resultant pressures for resource degradation. 46 There ‘is a belief that traditional tenure systems can achieve development objectives only under low population density .but are not compatible with rapid economic change and large increases in population pressure. 18 Land titling can have both positive and negative effects. The African experience bears this out. *Theoretically, land titling is considered important for increasing tenure security with a view to improving investment in land and water conservation. It is also held to improve access to capital inputs and the adoption of permanent crops. It further provides the collateral for ensuring increased access to institutional credit and for promoting land markets deemed to be so essential for the development of commercial agriculture. Lack of title can bias the farmer’s decision towards short-cycle crops. Operationally, however, the wealthier farmers can exercise their influence to obtain greater rights [IFAD (1992)]. Such titling can lead to likely negative effects on women through increased cultivation of commercial crops that men generally tend to control [von Brawn and Kennedy (1986)]. Income derived from common property resources is much more important to the rural poor than to the non-poor especially in the arid and semi arid regions. The studies by Jodha (1985, 1986, 199 1) show that common property resources accounted for 20 percent of the income of households cultivating less than two hectares (including landless households) and between 1 and 2 percent amongst the non-poor households in 21 groups of villages in India. These studies also show that common property resources declined sharply in area and productivity between the mid 1950s and the mid 1970s. However, “it is the- combination of more people, high interest rates and other “‘short-termist” incentives, scarce land and inadequate technical progress that threatens ‘to validate the claim that population growth in rural areas causes resource degradation -- and to do so whatever the structure of property rights” [Lipton (1997a, p. 89)]. Rural poverty also implies that the “wrong crops” may be gro.wn. In sub-tropical conditions most export crops (except cotton and groundnuts) tend to be less damaging to the soil than cereals and root crops. Most export crops grow on trees and bushes and have a continuous root structure and provide canopy cover. Repetto (1988) shows that, with grasses planted underneath such export crops, the rate of soil erosion is su.bstantially less than with food cr0ps.j’ Moreover, poor people are constrained in their access to credit, insurance and capital markets. These conditions get translated into larger herd sizes especially in times and places that have a high risk of draught and the possibility of greater mortality amongst the herds. These extra animals can lead to overgrazing and land degradation. Mechanization that is labor displacing (especially if is subsidized) can have negative impacts on poverty [Binswanger and van Braun (1993), Mellor and Desai (1985), Bell and Rich (1994), Ravallion and Datt (1994), Lipton with Longhurst (1989)]. Lack of alternative sources of employment can lead displaced families to scavenging off the land and common property resources leading to land degradation. The impact of irrigation on poverty is much less clear and depends on the technical features of the type of system 47 However, the fact that women control food while men control cash crops can generally translate into reduced incomes of women with increasing commercialization and to the resultant deterioration in the nutritional status @f the families [see for example von Braun and Kennedy (1986)]. 19 used [Narian and Roy (1980)] However, the processes through which irrigation leads to increasing soil salinity are well documented in the ecological literature [see for example Ehrlich, Ehrlich and Holdren (1977)]. Rigorous analyses of the differential behavior of poor versus non-poor households in terms of land degradation are sadly deficient. Such analyses require specifically collected data and detailed modeling of the household decision making processes. Collecting such data is a resource-intensive process and often requires skills that are not generally available in developing countries. Cost constraints generally imply small and often “non- representative” samples. This leads to the obvious questions of the generalizability of the results. There is a strong need to replicate such studies in as many situations as possible to be able to build up a body of knowledge for which conclusions can be generalized. 1.4 Mapping Rural Poverty and Land Quality The marginal lands study [Nelson et al. (1997)] had noted the great limitation in the understanding of the nature and distribution of marginal lands and the lack of readily available data in a geo-referenced framework, in particular with respect to the incidence and nature of poverty and probability of land degradation by land type. The World Resources Institute under a contract with UNEP/GRID/Arendal is conducting such a study [Henninger (1997)]. This work is part of the ongoing project to strengthen the use of geographic information systems in agricultural researcl14s and extends the previous work done by the World Resources Institute in mapping indicators of human development for West Africa. The set of poverty indicators used by the World Bank have been expanded to include accessibility (i.e., the degree to which people have access to resources) and vulnerability (low income groups who face high income uncertainty because of natural resource degradation). By including vulnerability defined in this way the researchers are hoping to identify a large proportion of people who can be easily pushed into poverty when the natural resource sector they depend on for their basic needs is being degraded. Henninger (1997) notes that the degree to which individual or geographic factors are causing poverty has implications for developing a strategy for agricultural research, which tends to improve the situation of the poor. If geographic factors play an important role then geographic targeting of agricultural research to the poor in these areas can become a useful tool to address poverty issues. This, of course, assumes that the ability of individuals to migrate out of these marginal areas is restricted. There is some evidence to support this assumption. The work by Ravallion (1994) shows significant spatial effects on living standards after controlling for non-geographic characteristics. These he terms as 48 The idea of defining and mapping major regions of the world in terms of climate, soils and natural vegetation as an aid to agricultural planning is not new. Systems of classification date back to the 1930s. [Koppen and Giger (1936), Troll and Paffen (1965), and Papadakis (1975 reported in Henninger (1997)]. These have proved useful in the work of the international agricultural research centers. spatial poverty traps. 20 The data limitations for mappin, 0 marginal lands in most developing countries were highlighted by the iMarginal Lands Study melson et al. (1997)]. The soil and length of growing period maps used to define the marginal agricultural lands and the favored agricultural lands included no information on land cover or use. Population data were only available at the first sub-national level and a constant poverty rate was applied for all areas within a country [Henninger (1997)]. Such data limitations were also evident in the IFPRI study by Broca and Oram (1990). These shortcomings will, however, remain till more detailed data become available. The World Bank”s Living Standards Measurement Surveys and the Macro International’s Demographic and Health Survey data sets which are the most likely sources of data for the socioeconomic aspects of such endeavors were originally designed to yield results representative at the national level. These were originally not intended to be broken down by sub-national units: The usefulness of these mapping exercises is constrained by the aggregate level of the available comparable information. Ranking of countries and territories according to the rural poverty dimension needs to be strengthened with more disaggregated information from several sources to make such exercises more effective for prioritizing research activities. Where the research mandate already has a clear natural resource mandate such rankings can assist in effectively prioritizing activities [e.g., ICARDA (I 99’73. 3 “. POVERTY AND LAND. DEGRADATION . Lipton (1997a) states forcefully that it is irrational to expect people to kno.wingly behave in ways that destroy resources necessary for their survival or that of their future generations 49 unless very strong pressures to do so are present. j” He lists four. such pressures generally discussed in the literature.” These include (1) increases in population as mortality falls but fertility declines lag and (2) declines in common property resources ” Often the problems of poverty, population and the environment are intertwined: earlier patterns of development and the pressure of rapidly-expanding population mean that many of the poor live in areas of acute environmental degradation [World Bank (1990)]. ” The World Bank maintains a similar position. “The poor do not willfully degrade the envirohment but poor families often lack the resources to avoid degrading their environment. The very poor, struggling at the edge of subsistence, are preoccupied with day to day survival. It is not that the poor have inherently short horizons; poor communities often have a strong ethic of stewardship in managing their traditional lands. But their fragile and limited resources, their often poorly defined property rights, and their limited access to credit and insurance markets prevent them from investing as much as they should in. environmental protection. When they do make ihvestments they need quick results [World. Bank (1992 p. 30)]. . 5’ According to the World Bank the main source of pressures generating problems of degradation is thought to lie in rapid population growth. Other pressures come from the widespread use of natural resource intensive technologies; ineffective regulation of common property resources; land tenure systems that do not secure long terms rights to land use; and policies that distort the prices of non-renewable resources [World Bank 199 1, in Biot et al. (19931. . 21 (CPRs). In addition there are international pressures; including (3) interest rate changes and (4) technology transfers [Lipton (1997a)]. Poverty generates significant incentives to have large families. Traditionally the impact of population growth on natural resources was discussed in terms of “carrying capacity.j2” Conceptually, if nothing else changes, then it is assumed that the increasing population will put demands on the resources that can no longer be met without damaging the ability of these resources to support human life. Social and economic factors such as trade, technology, consumption preferences and levels of inequality can alter the carrying capacity. Poor people will often use migration as a coping strategy. However, migration may not always benefit rural environments since the absolute numbers of rural people may continue to increase. Lipton (1997b) notes that technology generation in agriculture remains exogenous to most of the developing countries and is not driven significantly by their resource saving or other requirements. This is the classic choice of techniques problem highlighted in the literature on industrial development during the 1970s that first made popular terms such as “technological determinism.” This argument holds that the technically efficient techniques are generally developed in the capital-abundant labor-scarce devefoped countries and generally reflect the factor endowments of these countries. 2.1 Impact of Degradation on the Poors3 The poor g;~erally have access only to areas that have higher risk for health and income generation. And they generally lack the resources to reduce the exposure to the risk or to invest in alleviating the causes of such risk. Environmental degradation therefore can affect the health and nutrition status of the poor and lower their productivity. This can happen both directly through, for example, lower yields per unit of labor or land because of reduced soil quality, and indirectly through the reduced physical capacity of labor to j2 Attempts to compare current and projected populations to potential population supporting capacities (PSCs) at certain levels of technology have found that with low input technologies typical of current production practices 1975 populations had already exceeded carrying capacities in several West African countries. The study by Higgins, Kassam and Miken (1983) predicted that 7 of the 8 Sahelian countries will exceed population-supporting capacities by the year 2000. Regional imbalances and environmental $.mage were greatest in the Sahel0 Sudanian zone despite low population densities. Much of the discussion in this and the following subsection draws heavily from Mink (1993) j4 The most debilitating risk is that of drought in semi arid tropical areas. The combination of poverty and drought can have serious environmental consequences that threaten future agricultural productivity and the conservation of natural resources. Poor people are induced to scavenge more intensively during droughts, seeking out wood and other organic fuels, wild life and edible plants, both to eat and to sell. This scavenging aggravates deforestation and damage to watersheds and soil already under stress from the drought. The problem is aggravated in common property pastoral farming where farmers carrying extra cattle as insurance against drought may exploit and over burden the carrying capacity of the land increasing the likelihood of permanent damage. Small ruminants can be exceptionally damaging to resources. Poorer households are generally responsible for raising small ruminants, which are allowed to graze low quality resources especially on open access and common property land [IFAD (1992)]. 22 produce because of malnutrition and poor health. Even in cases where the poor are healthy labor productivity can be low due to increased time being allocated to less- productive activities such as fuel wood collection and away from agriculture and other income generating activities [Kumar and Hotchkiss, 19881. In terms of the productivity of the resources that the poor manage, the decline is intricately related to the p’overty- population-environment interaction [Mink (1993)]. Where the poor depend on biomass fuel and confront increasing fuel wood scarcity they often shift to using animal dung, fodder and crop residues for fuel. The quantities of these materials that are returned to the soil are thus reduced and its fertility declines. 55 Non-replenishment of soil nutrients leads to soil exhaustion as fuel wood supplies diminish and animal manure is increasingly used as a fuel substitute. Poverty forces a trade-off between the immediate demands for fuel for cooking and heating and manure for the land. The time-preference argument suigests that the immediate and urgerit needs be satisfied. Mortimore (1989) shows how soil exhaustion occurs when certain nutrients are taken from the soil but are not replenished naturally or artificially with fertilizers. A homogenous crop, usu+ly a cash crop, grown repeatedly on the same piece of land can lead to soil exhaustion. ‘~5 Increasing population pressures on land can also lead to shortened fallow periods and this coupled with the farmer’s inability to apply variable inputs more intensively because of poverty, can lead to decreased soil productivity. Productivity, especially, in open-access natural resources or of resources under deteriorating common property management may often decline due to over-use. 2.2 Poverty Impact on Resource Management Poverty is generally assumed to impose short time horizons.” Theoretically this results from the poor having high rates of pure time preference which lowers the ability to forego consumption today. This leads to using up savings previously set aside for later consumption and to borrowing if access to credit is available. The implicatioris’ of a high subjective discount rate are rapid resource extraction to meet present income or consumption needs and low investment in natural resources to improve future returns. Overgrazing of pastures and shortening of fallow periods can result from the high subjective discount rates. Similarly, farmers are less likely to make natural resource investments where returns are expected after a number of years. These factors combine to lead to a wide divergence between private and social discount rates.” ‘The empirical evidence on whether the poor really do have high rates of time preference is limited and j5 The loss in grain production as a result of diverting dung from fertilizer to fuel use in. Africa, the near east and Asia has been estimated at up to 20 million tons per year [Redclift and David (1990)]. 56 Given the declining yields on the land and the inability to find the institutional support in terms of fertilizer and access to credit and technology, poor farmers are forced to sell their land and become land less peasants or to encroach on new forest lands [de Graaff (1993)]. ” This is not to say that short time horizons are exclusive to the poor. ‘* Veloz et al. (1985) in their analysis of a soil conservation project in the Dominican Republic show that soil conservation is profitable on only 20 percent of the land area using private analysis. Alternatively social analysis based on discount rates that reflect the society’s inter temporal preference:;, indicate that soil conservation is viable in nearly 70 percent of the land area. 23 Risk aversion can lead to a short time horizon. To the extent that outcomes in the future become less certain than outcomes closer to the present, people will prefer to trade the more uncertain outcomes for the more certain ones. Risk aversion amongst farmer is widely documented [e.g., Binswanger (1980), Walker (1981), Grisley (1980) and Sillers (1980)]. The results of these studies generally indicate that attitudes of the poor to risk are not distinguished from those of the non-poor by innate or acquired characteristics but by the higher levels of risk faced by the poor and by the greater constraints to coping with these risks. Deteriorating land quality brings not only poorer yields but also greater yield fluctuations and hence higher risk.60 To the extent that access to common property resources serves as insurance for the poor in times of setbacks to the primary sources of income, the decrease in access can increase the risk. Migration can benefit the environment through mitigating risk.6’ Individual migration is increasingly seen as an outcome of family decision making, particularly in response to uninsured risks [Stark (1991)]. The poor face greater constraints to managing their risks. Their assets and stored production are generally minimal. Their access to credit and insurance is generally limited and or non-existent. Rural credit and insurance markets in developing countries are notoriously fragmented. In most cases there is also a gender bias so that poor women have far less access to mechanisms for managing risk than their male counterparts. If risk is allowed for, the interest rate incentive to deplete is probably sharpened. “Higher interest rates reduce the present value burden of long term future risks relative to that of near term risks (and costs). The land use patterns are therefore shifted towards activities with long-term risks such as possible long-term resource degradation. There is thus a powerful resource depleting incentive created by rising interest rates. Costly credit undoubtedly shifts the composition - of inputs, outputs, techniques, investment, consumption and savings - sharply in a resource depleting direction” [Lipton (1997a)]. 2.3 The Links Between Poverty and Land Degradation - Mixed Empirical Evidence The study by Grepperud (1997) concludes that in the relationship between poverty, land degradation and climatic uncertainty it is unclear whether poverty in general induces farmers to manage their resources poorly in the long run. The study by Scherr, Jackson and Templeton (1995) also found no consistent relationship between population density or the frequency with which land is used for productive purposes and degradation of the land. Population growth and poverty, they noted, create both incentives and disincentives j9 The ICRISAT study by Pender and Walker (1990) which estimated high rates of time preference through experimental games for a small sample of poor farmers in India is generally cited as an example. 60 Reardon and Vosti (1997) note that generalized poverty erodes traditional community risk sharing or insurance institutions by over taxing them; forcing the poor to fend for themselves often turning to resource mining and commons dependent strategies. ” Remittances are an important coping strategy for rural poor [Alderman and Paxson (1992)]. 24 for land degradation. There is an extreme dearth of studies that seek to rigorously test these relationships. The lack of appropriate data underlies this paucity. To do this effectively information is required not only on the physical aspects of the land but also of poverty and a host of other factors that need to be controlled for. Such data are not available at the present time. Reliance therefore has to be placed on studies from which the relationships can be inferred. Most of the available studies look at the problem in terms of the behavior of small-scale farmers and land degradation. Southgate (1988) maintains that small-scale farmers have been the main agents responsible for land degradation activities. He states t:hat market and institutional failure were the primary causes for farmers adopting non-sustainable practices. Pagiola (1995) shows how government price controls on agricultural goods in Kenya have not provided incentives for the small-scale and poor farmers to conserve their land. In some cases this has led to the mining of resources for maximum output. Mortimore (1989), on the other hand, finds evidence of small-scale farmers’ willingness to forgo short-term income gains even under price and famine pressure to pursue long term sustainable management strategies. The existence or non-existence of secure land tenure systems might explain the contradiction of results about small farmer behavior. Several studies cite the lack of secure land tenure as the primary reason for poor farmers cultivating their land excessively to exhaustion for the simple reason that they have no vested interest in conserving an asset that they do not own [see, for example, Southgate (1988), Mink (1993), Repetto et al. (I 989)]. 2.4 Household Level Effects of Degradation Change in agricultural practices can have primary and secondary effects on the environment. Von Braun (1997) describes the relationship between agricultural change and the eventual effects at the household level through these environmental effects. Such change has come about in the large part of the world through the adoption of the green revolution type technologies. Agricultural change can also occur where green revolution technologies have not been (as yet) adopted. In the case of the latter, the primary effects on the environment are generally stated to be in the form of desertification, deforestation, watershed degradation, soil erosion and soil fertility decline. The secondary effects can be droughts and floods. These environmental effects can translate into specific effects at the household level. These effects can take the form of impoverishment/produ.ctivity decline, migration-related health stress, vector borne disease (if the migration occurs into disease prone areas), communicable disease (when sanitation breaks down), chronic food insecurity, seasonal malnutrition and famines. In the case of the green revolution technology, potential environmental degradation can result from each Ielement in the technology package. It can result from the direct use of each of the technology elements and through indirect effects as well. For example, irrigation can lead to reduced water quantity or quality, salinization, increase in mosquitoes, aquatic snails and blackflies. Inappropriate pesticide use can have harmful household effects. Fertilizer use can result in nitrates leaching into drinking water. At the household level these aspects of potential 2.5 environmental degradation can translate into diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, malaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, poisoning and diseases of the circulatory system in infants. The secondary effects of the use of such technology can be crowding, sanitation deficiency, diet change and vector control (through inappropriate pesticide use). These can lead to communicable diseases, nutritional diseases and poisoning etc. These household effects imply a reduction in welfare, which under the conventional consumption based methods of measuring poverty, might not show up as such. That is why it ‘is important to include the non-income measures of poverty such as anthropometric measurements in assessments of the poverty status. 2.5 Conceptualizing the Linkages Between Poverty and Land Degradation Vosti and Reardon (1997) present an interesting conceptual model of the linkages between poverty and the environment that helps to highlight the complexity of the relationships. Poverty is seen to be the product of “asset” components comprising natural resources (private and commonly held), human resources, on-farm resources, off-farm resources, community-owned resources and social and political capital. These links are shown in Figure 2. These determine household and village behavior in terms of income generation, consumption, investment in assets, migration and human fertility, which in turn has implications for use and management of the natural resource component that, determines the asset components of poverty. How natural resources are used and managed feeds back as a determinant of the asset components of poverty. A set of conditioning factors governs the relationship between the asset components of poverty and household and village behavior and between the household and village behavior and the natural resource components. These conditioning factors are markets (prices), village and regional infrastructure, technologies (production and conservation), village level asset poverty and population pressures. This conceptualization leads to innovative policy implications. In comparing traditional productivity investments such as irrigation, fertilizer and modem seeds with conservation investments (such as bunds, terraces, windbreaks and practices such as organic matter application) the study finds that the latter have different requirements and characteristics. Conservation investments need innovative policies beyond just “getting prices right”. The three non-price policies suggested by the study are: complimentary public infrastructure investments (such as culverts to divert water flow from farm bunds) that make household investments more profitable to institutional innovations; that improve security and transferability of resource tenure; and, that modify community level arrangements to improve the management of the commons or watershed [Vosti and Reardon (1997)]. In the same book, von Braun (1997) also points out that poor communities lack resources for community level investments such as physical infrastructure, health and education. Policies that strengthen traditional institutions and make them more flexible (particularly in the face of increasing population pressure) can reduce poverty and the dependence of rural poor on resource miming especially in response to draughts and floods. 26 Defining poverty in the Vosti and Reardon (1997) manner sets a much higher cutoff than the conventional definition. Implicit in this conceptualization is the assumption that sizeable resources 62 over and above meeting bare subsistence consumption and production are required by the poor to address issues of resource degradation. While this model provides an interesting tool for conceptualizing some of the comple,xities involved; it also highlights the trade-off between the depth and detail of und.erstanding and concomitant data requirements; and, the inadequacy of available methodology and resources for measurement. G2 Estimates of the capital costs of prevention vary with the farming system, the methods used and topography. Expenditures of $50-$150 per hectare (sometimes less) for such measures as farm forestry and contouring with vetiver grass or other vegetative barriers are typical; $200-$500 may be required per hectare for structural measures (terracing, land leveling, earth banks and the like) on undegraded lands. Rehabilitation, in contrast, may cost from $500 to several thousand dollars per hectare, depending on the severity of the problem [FAO (1992)]. 27 Figure 2.

For simplicity he postulates four possible, though not mutually exclusive relationships64. These are Rl: Poverty leads to Environmental Degradation R2: Power Wealth and Greed leads to environmental Degradation R3A: Institutional Failure leads to environmental degradation R3B: Market Failure leads to Environmental Degradation R4: Environmental Degradation leads to Poverty If only Rl is observed then the poverty induced environmental degradation argument can be accepted. However based on the initial conditions only exogenous poverty can cause this environmental degradation. On the other hand if only R2 is observed then policies adopted under Rl assumptions can be misleading and may in fact exacerbate the degradation process, as demonstrated by Binswanger (1989). In case of either R3A or R3B being responsible for environmental degradation, the solution is theoretically relatively simple - remove or correct the market or institutional failure. If R4 is present two interesting observations arise. First R4 can only be present if it is caused by Rl, R2, R3A, or R3B or various combinations of all four. Second, the presence of :R4 can set into motion an Rl type of link but in this case it is indigenous poverty, wh.ich causes the environmental degradation. This is the Rl feedback or RlFB link. In the Rl, R4 link two outcomes are possible. The first scenario would be that Rl causes R4 and the causality link ends. On the other hand we can get a situation whereby the indigenous poverty caused by R4 sets into motion more environmental degradation by a RlFB relationship. The downward spiral of poverty leading to degradation leading to more poverty puming (1989)] is an RlFB type of relationship. The vari0u.s permutations and combinations of these four relationships highlight the complexity of the relationships. The model has four contributing forces namely: the power greed and wealth factor; exogenous poverty; institutional failure; and, market failure. It addresses two externalities namely environment degradation and indigenous poverty. The fear of losing land by the poor is a direct function of R2. R3A is also a primary contributor to land degradation in this manner. RlFB can be a contributory factor for soil exhaustion because of two reasons: first from within the sector due to decreases in agricultural productivity, and second from the fuelwood-manure relationship. In the first case, there is evidence of declining agricultural productivity in degraded lands causing indigenous poverty, which in turn forces many of the people to continue to degrade their land further to extract ” He defines indigenous poverty as poverty caused by environmental degradation and exogenous poverty as that caused by factors other than environmental degradation. G4 He postulates three crucial initial conditions: 1) no environmental degradation, 2) no indigenous poverty and 3) the possibility of the existence of exogenous poverty. 29 subsistence outputs. The R2 link in the forest sector can cause an RlFB affect in the land degradation category. R2, R3A, R3B and RlFB Iinkages can cause salinization. In the case of desertification, the primary links highlighted by Durriapah are R2, R3A and R3B. Durriapah concludes that most environmental protection programs fail because they address only the symptoms while they ignore the causes, i.e. they address only indigenous poverty and ignore its causes. 3. SUSTAINABLE LAND USE MANAGEMENT Much of the literature that assumes that poverty leads to degradation cannot explain instances of (materially) poor communities living sustainably with their environment for centuries. Induced innovation theory suggests that degradation at least in the long run may be self-correcting as resource scarcity and rising private and/or social costs from degradation induce the development and use of new agricultural and resource management practices6’ [Hayami and Ruttan (1985) and Boserup (1965)]. ‘j “Farmer-based innovation” describing the evolutionary process of adapting production technology to changes in factor scarcity is reported in a number of studies [for example, see Binswanger and Ruttan (1975) Hayami and Ruttan (1 SSS)]. These explanations draw their inspiration from the experience of the land scarce agricultural economy of Japan, where by the late 1800s biological innovations had begun to increase yields per unit of land while the United States which had many times more land per head of agricultural labor, had adopted a mechanized form of agricultural technology. It was, in response to rising land values in the 1940s that biological innovations were adopted widely in the United States. The evidence presented in Farming Systems in the Tropics documents a large literature showing that agricultural innovations are historically associated with increasing population density or increasing market integration in different agroecological zones [Rutenberg (1980)]. This study strongly suggests that most innovation in the tropics was either endogenous or resulted from transfer/adaptation between trading partners. Similarly much of the technical change in crop management and landscape management was a consequence of the crises in soil management. Pingali, Bigot and Binswanger (1987) document a similar of farm management in the area of mechanization. Other examples of largely endogenous transformation to local land- use innovations and local institutional development include the widely cited experience of the Machakos district in Kenya [Tiffen and Mortimore (1994)]. This heavily degraded area with its very low agricultural productivity and income had a population density beyond its “carrying capacity” in the 1930s. Yet over a 60-year period, although the population increased five-fold and the resource base has not been rehabilitated, the estimated value of agricultural production at constant prices has increased threefold. Despite considerable movement into more marginal agricultural zones, there is widespread tree-growing, most agricultural land has been terraced; and many new agricultural technologies are in use. The availability of good roads, opportunities to grow high value-added products for the Nairobi market and access to capital for land-related investments (terracing, tree growing, live fencing, water harvesting) enabled this change. The opportunities to generate off farm incomes aided in the process. Several other examples available in literature deserve to be mentioned. A study by Scherr (1993) documents the case of two districts in the mid- altitude region of Kenya near Lake Victoria where degradation of land and reduced crop yields and subsistence scarcities led to agroforestry strategies oriented towards intensification. The studies by Migot-Adholla et al. (199 1) and Place and Hazel1 (1993) document endogenous change in property rights in Africa. Place and Hazel1 (1993) found that the binding constraints to agricultural productivity were in fact lack of improved technology and inadequate access to credit. 30 The Induced Innovation Model in Natural Resource Management assumes that, with increasing population density or market demand, four distinct phases/time periods of management response can be identified. In the model the total supply of services and products from a given resource are a function of its quantity, quality and productivity of use. The first phase is characterized by dependence on naturally occurring, resources. The second stage marks the period of resource degradation. The third phase marking the onset of resource rehabilitation occurs with transition to intensive management because the benefits from the investment in resource rehabilitation outweigh the costs. The fourth phase is characterized by dependence on human managed resources ( for example agro- forestry, forest plantations and managed reserves). Most of the observed degradation can be explained by assuming that the innovative responses of phases three cvr four have not occurred. In many cases it can be shown that these have been delayed due to a number of conditions. However, there is considerable controversy over the adoption of conservation strategies. One school of thought maintains strongly that adoption of land conservation technologies is low across all agricultural environments despite major support and investment in research and development on the roblem. Instances where land degradation management have been successful are known 6! but analysis of these instances have ntot yet provided clear guidance to policy makers, researchers or developers to enable: more general adoption of these technologies [World Bank (1991a)l. The other school maintains that the lack of adoption of conservation technologies results from a lack of incentives.67 “The success of conservation measures is highly dependent on farmers receiving crop yield and economic benefits in the first or second season after implementation’? [FAiO (1989)]. This debate highlights the need to understand more fully why resource users do what they do, and how they reach decisions on resource use and environmental management [Biot et al. (1995)]. This debate does not difXerentiate between the behavior of poor versus non poor. GO Several successful farmer controlled soil conservation methods have been deveIoped and implemented at reasonable cost: A century’s old practice in India is being rediscovered, adapted and promoted. Deeply rooted, hedge forming vetiver grass, planted in contour strips across hill slopes, slows water run off dramatically, reduces erosion, and increases the moisture available for crop growth. A quiet revolution has taken place and today 90 percent of soil conservation efforts in India are based on such biological systems. In the Sahel simple technologies involving construction of rock bunds along contour line:; for soil and moisture conservation in Burkina Faso have on average increased yields by 10 percent in normal years and in dryer years by almost 50 percent. The Central Visayas Regional Development Project in the Philippines couples the promotion of contour grass strips for erosion control with distribution of young animals. The cost of preventing soil erosion and degradation are comparatively small while the costs OF rehabilitating tegraded areas can be large [FAO (1992)]. Investment in land will. depend on the importance of the farm vis. vis. non-farm incomes. There is considerable evidence that non-farm and off-farm incomes are relatively more important to livelihood security in areas with poor land [See Adams (1995) for exampies from fragile agricultural areas in Pakistan]. 31 4. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY In the heterodox policy approach to land degradation currently in vogue the “solutions to land degradation are thought to lie in out-migration, training poor people in better technjques of farming, diversification and off farm employment, providing local user groups with rights to manage degraded communal lands. .Policies to make land tenure more secure in areas in which traditional tenure systems have broken down. .adoption of low cost, low input technologies that would increase and stabilize yields, diversify production and maintain the resource base. (e.g.) contour cultivation:. . vetiver grass. _ . improved technology to terraced lands6’ and more* appropriate land. tenure policies. . government subsidies to develop and improve low return farming activities maybe the only way ‘to reduce poverty in these regions” [World Bank (1990)]. This approach focuses more on what the TAC report terms “marginal areas” and seems to ignore the fact that land c$gradation can easily affect the green revolution ‘and other high productivity areas also . Despite the fact that some argue that regions with marginal climates and soils are not rewarding to biophysical scientists and that there is not much scope for research on contours and terraces there seems to be considerable scope for agricultural research especially in the social science .aspects. The impact of agricultural research is larger where both the severity of poverty and the number of poor are accounted for [ICARDA (1997)]. The development community, as exemplified by the World Bti [Walton (1997)] and TAC pelson et al. (1997)], is seeking to move from counting the poor to understanding processes a;nd relationships and to documenting strategies that work. ’ . The work of the International Agricultural Research Centers can contribute significantly in several ways to poverty alleviatiori and simultaneous natural resource management. These strategies include efforts to develop technologies that simultaneously improve productivity and natural resource management that use low-cost inputs that the poor can . afford and apply; continuing to focus on developing resource-management practices that conserve soil, water and vegetation and do not decrease productivity. It includes strategies that focus on developing and disseminating more diversified farming systems that reduce economic risk, contribute to greater resource use efficiency and .provide higher returns to the farm community and continuing to focus on improved vertical integration from producers to consumers, including enhanced quality and added value of farm products,’ improved post harvest processing and storage, and employment generation [e.g., ICARDA (1997)]. These strategies call for the integration of research an commodity improvement with the conservation and management of natural resources. This h’as long been recdgnized as one GS l In dry land areas gains will commonly arise more from improvements in physical structure leading to enhanced’ soil moisture levels and retention [Shaxson (1992)] than from the reduction of soil nutrient gses, although the latter are importtnt, [Stocking (1986)]. I am thankful to Ted Herrzell, formerly of TAC for highlighting this distinction. 32 of the major organizational challenges facing the future of international agricultural research.” Several lessons reported in the Crosson and Anderson (1993) study are relevant to the agenda setting for policy research within this framework of integrating research on commodity improvement with conservation and management of natural resources (NRM). Specifically: If input policies and institutions are weak and the success of commodity research depends on purchased inputs then NRM research might be a better investment than commodity research; If commodity research and NRM research are complementary then poor policies and weak institutions lower the return to both kinds of research; Research to find ways to reduce off-farm losses caused by on-farm practices will only be used if farmers benefit from the solutions deveioped; Attacking some problems such as downstream effects of soil erosion at the farm level may not be the most efficient solution. It may be more efficient to increase productivity on the farm and find other technical and institutional means to reduce the damages of sediment downstream. TAC (1997) indicates four cases of NRM where the System should concentrate its resources because user incentives are weakest there. These are cases where: l Benefits accrue over a long time, l Benefits accrue remotely, l Benefits are relatively difficult to identify, and l Benefits accrue to different persons than those who bear the cost of management. TAC (1997) also highlights the criteria for assessing the relative importance of the substance of proposals for NRM research in the CGIAR system. Its first criterion is that the research should contribute to poverty alleviation and environmental prot:ection and/or enhancement. Answers to several questions identified by Scherr (1998) can help to clarify process of priority setting in the area of poverty and land degradation. Specifically answers to questions such as: Who are the principal resource users ? What are their actual (as opposed to theoretical) incentives for investment and dis-investment in important natural resources? What are the farmer’s and the community’s perceptions of resource degradation? What is their understanding of the ecological processes involved when production systems change or their strategies of adapting to degradation change? What is the empirical evidence of resource degradation at the farm, community and regional levels, and the realistic estimates of the costs and benefits of resource rehabilitation for the different actors? 70 see the March 1993 Report of the Center Director’s Working Group on Ecoregional Approach (Annex 1, p.3) 33 can greatly facilitate effective policy making. Effective policy agendas, as Crosson and Anderson (1993) stress, need to be built on realism and should avoid the tendency to “reinvent another wheel for which there is no demand.” Precise measurement and rigorous analysis are necessary to understand fully the processes of poverty and land degradation. For effective extrapolation and prediction it is important to build up from several rigorous case studies of household decision making based on multi-year panel data sets that include specific land quality and use modules. 34 REFERENCES Adams, R. 1995.

The greatest debt in this regard is to Jock R. Anderson of the World Bank who gave freely of his knowledge and insight and permitted unlimited access to his considerable collection of relevant materials. Sara Scherr, formerly of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and currently with the University of Maryland, peirmitted access to her work in progress entitled Is Soil Degradation a Threat to Developing Country Food Security? The current study has benefited tremendously from her work. Norbert Henninger of the World Resources Institute and Stefan Pagiola of the World Bank provided relevant materials and input into the clarification of the issues. Ted Henzell, then on TAC, and Guido Gryseels of the TAC Secretariat provided direction. While this study has benefited from the help and guidance provided by these individuals, they are in no way responsible for any inadequacies or for errors or omissions 45 APPENDIX 1: Hot Spots of Land Degradation Nutrient Depletion Salinization Constraints to Yield Increases Erosion South and West Asia Mid-altitude hills of Nepal(with decline in nutrient supplements from Forests) Poor soil quality in areas of northeastern India in :ransition to permanent agriculture East and Southeast Asia Nutrient mining in sandy soils of northeastern Thailand and remote upland areas in the region Poor quality soil in Myanmar, degrading in :ransition to permanent Indus, Tigris and Euphrates River basins Rice-wheat region(unspecified stagnation) Lack of suitable technology for marginal arable lands in Syria, Jordan and Iran Northeastern Thailand and China Stagnant yields of intensive irrigated rice in dense areas of Java, China, the Philippines and Vietnam (waterlogging, nutrient imbalance) Foothills of the Himalayas Conversion of rangelands in West Asia to grain production, creating erosion Sloping areas in southern China and Southeast Asia agriculture 4frica Semi-arid croplands of Burkina Faso and Senegal Ileading to outmigration) Large areas under transition :o short fallow or permanent :ropping Reduction of silt deposits in the Nile Delta following construction of the Aswan High Dam Latin America Subhumid Central American hillsides Semi-arid Andean valleys Northeastern Brazil Santa Cruz.

Apart from the selection of poverty line the measurement of poverty generally focuses on computing three indices. These reflect: 4 The prevalence or incidence of poverty as measured by the fraction in the total population living beiow the poverty line i.e. the head-count b) The intensity of poverty reflected in the extent to which the income of the poor lies below the poverty line, as measured by the differences between the two i.e. the poverty gap; 4 The degree of inequality among the poor, in such a way that income transfers from the worse off among the poor to the less poor should raise measured poverty and vice versa i.e. the severity ofpoverty irzdex. Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984) have suggested a useful general index that meets these requirements. Their class of poverty indices takes the following form: where Z, denotes the poverty line, Y, the expenditure or income of the i-th poor household (or individual), N the total number of households and q the number of households whose expenditures or incomes are below the poverty line. This index is based on measuring the gap between the poverty line and the expenditure or income of the poor as a fraction of the poverty line [Z, .- YJ / Zp , raising it to a power a and then summing over all poor units. Not only does the index take into account the prevalence and intensity of poverty, it may also be used to reflect the degree of inequality among the poor by varying the value of the a parameter. Thus, if a=O, index P, becomes: P, = q/N, which has been referred to as the head- count index. It reflects the proportion of total population lying below the poverty line, i.e., the proportion of poor in the total population. This measure is indifferent to the extent of poverty of the poor. It is only sensitive to their number and reflects the prevalence of poverty. Alternatively, with a = 1, the poverty index P, becomes: PI = + $ [Zp-Yil/Zp = IpO I I where I is the “income gap ratio”, i.e., the mean income gap of the poor (Z, - Y) - where ? = C Yi / q is the mean expenditure (income) of the poor expressed as a fraction of poverty line. Thus, P1 is the income gap ratio multiplied by the head-count index. This index, gives a good measure of the extent or intensity of poverty as it reflects how far the poor are from the poverty line. It may also be used to show the amount of 49 income, under perfect targeting, that needs to be transferred to the poor to close the poverty gap in order to eradicate poverty. However, Pt is insensitive to income distribution among the poor. Income transfers between the poor will leave P1 unchanged. For this to be reflected in the index, greater weight has to be given to the poorest units. This can be achieved by setting a = 2. If a = 2, the poverty index becomes” Pl = i $ CZp-Yi)/Zp12 I 1 P, is the mean squared proportionate poverty gap. This index is not easy to interpret as compared to PO and P1, however, it has the advantage of reflecting the degree of inequality among the poor, in the sense that the greater the inequality of distribution among the poor and thus the severity of poverty, the higher is P,. This class of poverty indices is additive, it permits the summing up of poverty indices for various subgroups in the population. “Lipton M. and Jacques van der Gaag. 1993. Inchdipzg the Poor.
