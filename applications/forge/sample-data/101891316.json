Three groups of mice were used in the current study: the relatively liver-tumor-sensitive C3H/He strain and B6C3F1 stock (C57BL/63C3H/He), as well as the relatively resis-tant C57BL/6 strain. For a 2-week period, animals from each group were given drinking water containing a tumor-promoting dose of phenobarbital (PB), a nongenotoxic rodent carcinogen. Methylation-sensitive restriction digests using HpaII or MspI were followed by PCR amplification using an arbitrary primer or primer pair, binding preferentially to guanine and cytysine (GC)-rich regions of DNA, including CpG islands. This procedure allows for assessment of methylation at the internal and/or exter-nal cytosine of the 5*-CCGG-3 * sites recognized by MspI an", "downloadUrl": null, "fullTextIdentifier": "http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/1/51.full.pdf", "pdfHashValue": null, "publisher": null, "journals": [], "language": null, "relations": [], "year": 2015, "topics": [], "subjects": ["text"], "fullText": null, "urls": ["http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/1/51.full.pdf", "http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/1/51.full.pdf", "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.582.9903"], "issn": null}
