Intermittent hormone therapy (IHT) has gained interest as an alternative to continuous hormone therapy for advanced PCa, with the aim of reducing adverse events and improving QoL [3\u20135]. Generally, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the potential risks of ADT in patients with PCa. Additionally, patients should be well informed about the treatment approach and its potential adverse events. During the symposium \u2018\u2018Prostate cancer: Closing the gap between science and practice\u2019\u2019, five experts discussed recent findings related to PCa treatment, particularly hormone therapy.
