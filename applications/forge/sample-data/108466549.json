The optimal disturbance rejection control problem is considered for a kind of consensus with control time-delay affected by external persistent disturbances and noise. An transformation method is used to convert the consensus with control time-delay to the consensus system without time-delay. The optimal estimated values of the converted consensus system states are obtained by recursive filtering with Kalman filter. Then the feedforward-feedback optimal control law is deduced by solving the Riccati equations and matrix equations. Lastly, simulations show the result is effectiveness to the consensus system with time-delay with respect to external persistent disturbances and noise", "downloadUrl": null, "fullTextIdentifier": "http://www.scientific.net/amm.490-491.828.pdf", "pdfHashValue": null, "publisher": null, "journals": [], "language": null, "relations": [], "year": 2016, "topics": ["Multiple Agents System", "time-delay", "consensus tracking", "optimal disturbance rejection"], "subjects": ["text"], "fullText": null, "urls": ["http://www.scientific.net/amm.490-491.828.pdf", "http://www.scientific.net/amm.490-491.828.pdf", "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.920.5388"], "issn": null}
