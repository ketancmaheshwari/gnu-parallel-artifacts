This paper explores how women members negotiate participation in the bank and analyses the relationship between responsibility, risk and empowerment. It is based on an ethnographic study in Luribay, Bolivia where the microfinance institution Credit with Rural Education has been operating since 2000. The village bank is placed in the context of gender relations in Luribay and ideas of risk, responsibility and empowerment explored in that context", "downloadUrl": null, "fullTextIdentifier": null, "pdfHashValue": null, "publisher": "'Wiley'", "journals": [], "language": null, "relations": [], "year": 2012, "topics": ["geog"], "subjects": ["geog"], "fullText": null, "urls": null, "issn": null}
