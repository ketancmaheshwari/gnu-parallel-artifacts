Some clarification might be gained by considering situations where hormone levels vary between pregnancies. Study participants from an Australian population-based, case-control study of epithelial ovarian cancer (2001-2005) completed a reproductive/lifestyle questionnaire. The authors included 1,203 cases and 1,286 controls with at least 1 birth and, using multiple logistic regression, calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to investigate the effects of pregnancy-related factors on cancer risk. Women who had 1 or more preterm births had higher risks of ovarian cancer than those who had only full-term births (odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 2.15). The authors also found that bearing only boys was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of mucinous ovarian cancer (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.15, 4.17). There was no association between multiple pregnancy and ovarian cancer (for any multiple pregnancy vs. only singleton pregnancies: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.02). The results suggest that pregnancies associated with differing hormonal milieux have different effects on ovarian cancer risk and that some of these associations may vary with histologic subtype", "downloadUrl": null, "fullTextIdentifier": null, "pdfHashValue": null, "publisher": "'Oxford University Press (OUP)'", "journals": [], "language": null, "relations": ["doi:10.1093/aje/kwp185", "issn:0002-9262", "orcid:https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4566-1414", "orcid:https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0733-5930", "DAMD17-01-1-0729", "199600"], "year": 2009, "topics": ["multiple birth offspring", "ovarian neoplasms", "premature birth", "HUMAN CHORIONIC-GONADOTROPIN", "MATERNAL RISK", "FETAL SEX", "REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS", "3RD TRIMESTER", "UNITED-STATES", "TWIN BIRTHS", "PREGNANCY", "GENDER", "BREAST", "C1", "920102 Cancer and Related Disorders", "1117 Public Health and Health Services"], "subjects": ["Journal Article"], "fullText": null, "urls": ["https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183574"], "issn": null}
