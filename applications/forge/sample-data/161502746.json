These arise as redundancies under mismatched compression when cumulants of compressed lengths are considered instead of expected compressed lengths. These parametric relative entropies are a generalization of the usual relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). Just like relative entropy, these relative alpha-entropies behave like squared Euclidean distance and satisfy the Pythagorean property. Minimization of I-alpha(P, Q) over the first argument on a set of probability distributions that constitutes a linear family is studied. Such a minimization generalizes the maximum Renyi or Tsallis entropy principle. The minimizing probability distribution (termed I-alpha-projection) for a linear family is shown to have a power-law", "downloadUrl": null, "fullTextIdentifier": null, "pdfHashValue": null, "publisher": null, "journals": [], "language": null, "relations": ["http://eprints.iisc.ac.in/54563/", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2015.7084835"], "year": 2015, "topics": ["Electrical Communication Engineering"], "subjects": ["Conference Proceedings", "NonPeerReviewed"], "fullText": null, "urls": ["http://eprints.iisc.ac.in/54563/1/Twe_Fir_Nat_Con_Com_2015.pdf", "http://eprints.iisc.ac.in/54563/"], "issn": null}
